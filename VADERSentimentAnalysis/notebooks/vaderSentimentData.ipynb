    "### Include necessary packages for notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's extensibility comes in large part from packages. Packages are groups of functions, data, and algorithms that allow users to easily carry out processes without recreating the wheel. Some packages are included in the basic installation of Python, others created by Python users are available for download.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, packages can be installed by simply typing `pip install nameofpackage --user`. However, since you are using ReD and our Python environment, you will not need to install any of the packages below to use this notebook. Anytime you need to make use of a package, however, you need to import it so that Python knows to look in these packages for any functions or commands you use. Below is a brief description of the packages we are using in this notebook:     \n",
    "\n",
    "- **nltk:** Platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. Here we bring in the VADER sentiment analysis tool which is now a part of the nltk package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pickle:** Implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. \"Pickling\" is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and \"unpickling\" is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas:** An open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **os:** This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **glob:** Finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **zipfile:** Allows for handling of zipfiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we import some of the packages differently. In some cases we just import the entire package when we say `import XYZ`. For some packages which are small, or, from which we are going to use a lot of the functionality it provides, this is fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when we import the package directly we say `import XYZ as X`. All this does is allow us to type `X` instead of `XYZ` when we use certain functions from the package. So we can now say `X.function()` instead of `XYZ.function()`. This saves time typing and eliminates errors from having to type out longer package names. I could just as easily type `import XYZ as potato` and whenever I use a function from the `XYZ` package I would need to type `potato.function()`. What we import the package as is up to you, but some commonly used packages have abbreviations that are standard amongst Python users such as `import pandas as pd` or `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. You do not need to us `pd` or `plt`, however, these are widely used and using something else could confuse other users and is generally considered bad practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other times we import only specific elements or functions from a package. This is common with packages that are very large and provide a lot of functionality, but from which we are only using a couple functions or a specific subset of the package that contains the functionality we need. This is seen when we say `from XYZ import ABC`. This is saying I only want the `ABC` function from the `XYZ` package. Sometimes we need to point to the specific location where a function is located within the package. We do this by adding periods in between the directory names, so it would look like `from XYZ.123.A1B2 import LMN`. This says we want the `LMN` function which is located in the `XYZ` package and then the `123` and `A1B2` directory in that package. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import more than one function from a package by separating the functions with commas like this `from XYZ import ABC, LMN, QRS`. This imports the `ABC`, `LMN` and `QRS` functions from the `XYZ` package."

    "First we need to decide if we want to read in one file or a whole directory of files. If you want to read in a whole directory then set `source` equal to `\"*\"` as this is what is called a regular expression that means 'all'. So we are reading in 'all' the files in a directory. If you wish to read in a single file then set `source` equal to the name of the desired file in quotes, but leaving the '.json' or '.csv' off at the end. So a single file should look like this: `source = \"myFileName\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we assign the file type our data comes in to a variable. At the moment the only options are '.csv' or '.json' as these are the most popular twitter data formats. We assign the format to the `fileType` variable. It should look like this: `fileType = \".json\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `textColIndex` variable is where we put the header name of the dataframe column that will contain the content we are interested in from our tweets. Generally the content of the tweets are labeled as \"text\" since this is the label given to the tweet content when it is pulled directly from the Twitter API. For this reason our default value assigned to the `textColIndex` is `\"text\"`. If for some reason the tweet content has a different label or header, and you need to change this, remember to keep the quotes around the new label.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `encoding` is where you determine what type of encoding to use (ascii, ISO-8850-1, utf-8, etc...). We have it set to utf-8 at the moment as we have found it is less likely to have any problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining variables should not need to be changed. The variable `scores` is an empty list that will have data added to it further down in the code. The variables `total`, `numberOfTweets`, and `totalSquared` are variables used for counting which is why 0 is assigned to them since we generally start with nothing when counting."
