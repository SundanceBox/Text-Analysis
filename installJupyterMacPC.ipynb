    "#### Anaconda and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be describing how to acquire Python via Anaconda. The reason is that Anaconda comes with Jupyter Notebooks and many other Python packages already installed. First, it is important to determine if you already have Anaconda. You can do this by searching your system for Anaconda. On a Mac hit command+spacebar and type *Anaconda* in the search box that pops up. On a PC type *Anaconda* in the search box next to the Windows Start button. If you get results showing files or apps on your computer with the name *Anaconda* then you already have Anaconda, and therefore Python, installed on your computer. If your results show that you do not have Anaconda on your computer then skip to *Installing Anaconda* below. If you do have Anaconda already installed, we need to check what version of Python came with your version of Anaconda. You will need Python 3 in order to use our scripts.  To check the version open your terminal (search like you did before when you searched for Anaconda. On a Mac type *terminal* in your search, on a PC type *cmd* in your search) and type: `python --version`. If you do not have Python, then you will get an error that your computer does not recognize the command 'python'. If you do have Python you should get something like this: \n",

    "\n",
    "If your result says Python 3.x.x, then you are good. If it says anything else (Python 2.x.x, no command 'python', yellow), then you need to download Anaconda, which includes Python and a lot of pre-installed Python modules that we will be using with our notebooks. To download Anaconda, go to [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Make sure you download the most recent verison of Python 3."

    "#### Pip\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have Python 3 ready to go, we need to talk about pip. Who or what is pip? Pip is used for python package management. It makes installation of python packages much easier. Since you installed Anaconda, you will need to open your terminal (Mac) or command prompt (PC) and type 'conda install pip' and this should get pip up and running.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as you get more comfortable with coding and want to install some Python packages on your own, you may come across some tutorials online telling you to use the command `pip3` to install packages for Python 3. The command `pip3` is used to install Python packages only if you do not have Python via Anaconda. If you installed Anaconda and did the 'conda install pip' step above, then you will use `pip` (without the 3) to install packages even though you are using Python 3. Again, please note that if you have Python 3 via Anaconda, you use `pip` and not `pip3`. Now, to install a python package open your terminal or command prompt and begin installing Python packages using `pip install pythonpackage`."

    "Jupyter automatically pulls in your home directory. This is usually your directory with your username on a Mac. On a PC it is usually C:\\Program Files\\. So you might want to create a folder in your home directory to store all your Jupyter Notebooks. For example, I have a folder called JupyNotebooks in my home directory which contains all my Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter will save a newly created notebook in whichever directory or folder you happen to be in, so navigate to the folder you wish to have your notebook saved in before you start creating one."

If, however, you wish to type out titles and instructions, go to the dropdown box that says “code” and choose “markdown.” Now you can type out titles and instructions using markdown. When you are done hit “shift” + “return” at the same time and a new cell will appear and your markdown or code will appear above it. Then input your Python code or more markdown if you wish. When you enter code and want to see if it works, simply hit “shift” and “return” at the same time and it will run your Python code and spit out any results or errors if there are any. If you have data that takes a while to process you’ll see a [ * ] in the brackets to the left of the cell while it is processing. When it is done, there will be a number there indicating the number of times code in general has been run. These numbers and asterisks do not appear next to markdown cells, only code cells.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks are great as they allow you to give detailed directions about the code and run the code at the same time. This makes it a great teaching and learning tool. You can also load them into GitHub. They will not be interactive on GitHub, but people can download them from there and run them on Jupyter Notebook on ReD or on their own machines or simply copy and paste the code into their terminal or command prompt or an IDE of their choice."
