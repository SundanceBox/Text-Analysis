			Captain's Log, Stardate 46461.3.
			The Enterprise has entered the
			Ipai Sector, where we are
			scheduled to deliver supplies to
			a remote communication relay
			station near the Klingon border.
			Station forty-seven is still not
			responding to our hails, Captain.
			Should be two people aboard.
			Lieutenants Aquiel Uhnari... and
			Keith Rocha.
			Life signs?
			It is difficult to scan through
			the concentrated subspace signals.
			Mister Worf...
			What is that noise?
			They must've left the audio
			monitoring system on! We're
			hearing a few thousand subspace
			messages! I'll try to shut it
			off!
			Commander...
			It's coming from inside this
			service duct... could be a loose
			cover plate...
			Here's your loose cover plate...
			Hey there, pooch...
			The shuttlecraft is gone. There
			is no one aboard.
			Commander...
			What is it?
			Cellular residue... I think it's
			the remains of one of our
			Lieutenants.
			All of the blood traces I found
			match Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
			For now I'll assume these are her
			remains... but I'll need to take
			the deckplate back to Sickbay to
			make sure.
			It would take a powerful weapon to
			do this...
			I'll have a better idea after I've
			analyzed the deckplate.
			If that is Lieutenant Uhnari...
			Where's Rocha?
			The station's shuttle is gone.
			Maybe he took it.
			Before Uhnari died... or after?
			We're ready, Commander.
			Any luck downloading the station
			logs?
			Not yet. I can't get past the
			security lock-outs.
			But I think I know why...
			All encrypted subspace messages
			are sent through this channel.
			Look at the signal notation...
			It's out of sequence.
			I'd say somebody tried to by-pass
			the access protocol and break into
			the coded messages. It caused the
			security lock-outs to freeze up.
			Are there any messages missing?
			I won't know until I can get into
			the files.
			I'm going to try accessing the
			logs from another console.
			Looks like you've made a friend.
			Yeah...
			We're going back to the ship. Let
			me know as soon as you have
			something.
			Aye sir.
			Riker to Enterprise. Four to beam
			back.
			Come on, girl...
			All right... what do you say we
			try repolarizing the interface...
			This doesn't look like yours...
			Is this what you're looking for?
			Computer, run station logs in
			sequence.
			-- Log, Stardate 46458.3. Today
			we configured the relay controller
			grid. It was the last primary
			system we had to overhaul. We are
			scheduled to recalibrate and align
			the antennae systems in the next
			three days.
			Computer, access visual output.
			... sent in my third request for a
			message delay buffer. Until it
			arrives, Lieutenant Rocha and I
			have rigged a memory module to
			compensate. It'd better work...
			or about a half million subspace
			messages are going to end up
			drifting through space.
			Computer, open Uhnari
			correspondence file.
			Computer... access correspondence
			files... Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
			Hello, Shianna. Sorry I haven't
			talked to you in a while... but
			I've been dealing with the new
			Lieutenant, Rocha. So far he's
			been rude, arrogant, and
			condescending -- and he's only
			been here two days. This might be
			a long year...
			Come on, Lieutenant... stick with
			me...
			-- I had the dream again. Mother
			is calling out my name... she's
			somewhere in the house... I get to
			the top of the hill all right...
			but then the house is slanted...
			I'm still walking uphill. I can't
			find her... doors everywhere and
			they all look the same...
			The cellular residue is completely
			fused with the metal of the
			deckplate.
			We're trying to micro-vaporize the
			metal... so I can get a clean DNA
			sample.
			Do you have any idea what killed
			her?
			Well... this is just a guess, but
			from the molecular deposition on
			the plating I'd say it was a highlevel
			phaser blast.
			Could it have been a Klingon
			disruptor?
			Possibly.
			Geordi found evidence that the
			encrypted messages might have been
			tampered with.
			We're pretty close to Klingon
			space...
			There hasn't been a Klingon raid
			against the Federation in over
			seven years.
			I don't want to risk a diplomatic
			incident until we have more
			evidence.
			And there's still the question of
			what happened to Lieutenant
			Rocha...
			Get Rocha's personnel file from
			Starfleet Command. And ask
			Starbase Two-Twelve to help search
			for that shuttle.
			Aye sir.
			Keep me apprised.
			Alright... let's try this again...
			The phase inducers are aligned...
			this should be working...
			Come on, Lieutenant... I know
			you're in there somewhere...
			Computer -- run a subsystem
			diagnostic, with a frequency range
			of ten to one hundred megahertz.
			Diagnostic cycle will be complete
			in twenty seconds.
			Iced coffee.
			What is it, girl?
			Hello, Shianna. By the time you
			get this... the Batarael will be
			over. This is the first year I
			haven't been there... I've been
			wondering who's singing the Horath
			in my place...
			"Jomiael hahnalia ma marou nitalia
			Rumael tavariel fatra di va
			Jomiael Batarael... "
			"continues to sing song - TBD"
			"finishes song - TBD"
			I had the dream again... the one
			where Mother is screaming... I
			climb the hill to our house... but
			I can't get to her...
			Shianna, this time I ran away. I
			was so scared I ran back down the
			hill...
			I think I know why I've been
			having dreams about danger... it's
			because of what's been happening
			with that Klingon.
			He's getting more aggressive all
			the time.
			... it's because of what's been
			happening with that Klingon. He's
			getting more aggressive all the
			time. Not just the usual
			threats... Morag actually locked
			his disruptors on the station this
			time.
			I don't really think there'll be
			any trouble... it just gives me
			those panic feelings... wanting to
			run, wanting to get away from
			danger.
			Shianna, I couldn't say this to
			anyone but you... but... the
			panic... is the same thing I used
			to feel when Father got angry...
			when I knew he was going to punish
			me...
			Only now I'm out here in space and
			there's no place to run.
			There are at least three
			references to a Commander Morag --
			a Klingon officer who patrols this
			section of the border. Apparently
			he would pass the station every
			few days and harass them.
			Perhaps Morag was the one
			interested in obtaining the
			encrypted messages.
			Could be. She didn't say.
			I still have several days worth of
			logs left to watch. Maybe I'll
			learn more.
			Very well. In the meantime, I'll
			talk to the Klingon Governor about
			Commander Morag.
			Computer -- access Aquiel Uhnari's
			personal logs.
			Begin playback.
			Shianna, you always said I'd look
			great with a wig. So here it is.
			What do you think?
			Definitely not you.
			Okay... maybe I'm getting a little
			crazy... you would, too, if you
			were on a relay station in the
			middle of nowhere with no one for
			company except an egomaniac like
			Keith Rocha.
			I took a big risk today... I
			countermanded an order he gave...
			I agreed to handle the com traffic
			of Relay Station one-nine-four
			while they shut down for
			maintenance. Rocha said we
			couldn't handle the additional
			signal load... but I think he's
			wrong.
			When he finds out... he'll be
			furious.
			It's days like this that I wish I
			was home. You know what I miss?
			Muskan seed punch.
			Real Muskan seed punch. I can get
			it from the replicator... but it's
			not the same. I'd give anything
			for some of the punch Mother used
			to make... with chunks of the
			seeds still in it...
			I had the dream again.
			Keith? Is that you?
			Commander... there are DNA traces
			here. They are Klingon.
			So Klingons did board the
			station...
			I have only found DNA from one
			Klingon so far. I will continue
			to scan.
			How could she read this stuff... ?
			How's it going?
			I've managed to access all of
			Lieutenant Uhnari's logs. I'm
			looking for Rocha's now. Whatever
			happened to the encrypted messages
			had a cascade effect on the whole
			storage system, and I can't find
			any of his files.
			Maybe Rocha didn't make the
			official logs... Uhnari might have
			been responsible for them.
			I don't think so. Aquiel was the
			junior officer.
			"Aquiel"?
			Lieutenant Uhnari.
			I was up all night watching her
			personal logs... I guess I'm
			starting to feel like I know her.
			What was she like?
			Well... she was Hahliian... she
			had one sister, named Shianna...
			she drank muskan seed punch... she
			had a sense of humor that I could
			only describe as... "unique."
			She loved to sing... and read...
			... books of questionable taste.
			Enterprise to Commander Riker.
			Riker here.
			The Klingon ship Qu'Vat has
			arrived with Governor Torak.
			Please report to the Observation
			Lounge.
			On my way, sir.
			Torak claims to be bringing
			evidence that the Klingons had no
			involvement in the murder of
			Lieutenant Uhnari.
			Really. We just found evidence
			that there was at least one
			Klingon at the scene of the
			murder.
			This should be an interesting
			meeting.
			Governor Torak, sir.
			Governor. Welcome aboard...
			Do not bore me with your human
			pleasantries. I told you we did
			not kill the woman. Now I will
			prove it to you...
			ghoS! (Come!)
			This is Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.
			We were running a level two
			diagnostic of the message
			buffer... nothing special. Rocha
			had been on edge all morning, but
			he'd been irritable ever since he
			got there, so I didn't think
			anything of it...
			We were mid-way through the
			procedure... and suddenly... he
			attacked me...
			He grabbed me... and threw me
			against the port bulkhead... I
			yelled at him to stop, but he
			wouldn't listen. He took me by
			the throat... I broke free and
			tried to get to the weapons
			locker...
			I'm not sure what happened next...
			but somehow I got aboard the
			shuttle and left...
			We found her on our side of the
			border heading toward Sector Two
			Five Two Zero. She is lucky my
			patrol ship did not destroy her
			vessel on sight.
			Lieutenant... why didn't you
			contact Starfleet and report what
			happened aboard the Station?
			I... don't know, sir. Maybe I
			passed out. I'm not even sure how
			long I was in the shuttle before
			the Klingons picked me up.
			Forty-six hours.
			You've been gone forty-six hours.
			We assumed you were dead. Your
			blood stains were found at the
			murder scene.
			I think I cut my head when he
			threw me against the bulkhead.
			Then the remains we found must be
			Lieutenant Rocha.
			I can't confirm that.
			Until we can separate the cellular
			residue from the deckplate, I
			won't be able to get a clear DNA
			scan.
			You said you tried to get to the
			weapons locker... is it possible
			that you did?
			No, I... I didn't.
			You're sure?
			I don't... exactly remember
			everything after he attacked me...
			I'm sorry. It's as if my memories
			were... drained right out of me...
			Your logs said that a Commander
			Morag had been harassing you...
			did you ever let him or any other
			Klingon aboard the station?
			Absolutely not.
			If that is true, then Morag or
			some other Klingon boarded the
			station after she left.
			We found Klingon DNA traces aboard
			the station.
			You still try to blame us!
			Have the courage to admit your
			mistakes. Or are you a lo'Be Vos?
			At least I do not wear the uniform
			of a P'tak!
			Governor Torak... we are merely
			exploring all the possibilities.
			Lieutenant Uhnari's logs said
			Commander Morag was harassing the
			station --
			He was doing his job!
			If he was only doing his job, then
			I'm sure you won't mind if we
			speak with him.
			Very well. In the interests of
			diplomacy, I will allow you to
			speak to Morag... but my patience
			has limits.
			Lieutenant... I know a friend of
			yours who's very eager to see you.
			Who?
			Come on...
			Maura! I was worried about you...
			good girl...
			Maura... so that's her name.
			Yes, it's from "Cold Moon Over
			Blackwater." Have you read it?
			No... I'm not much for gothic
			fiction.
			Most people aren't nowadays.
			Yeah... Maura got a little...
			restless.
			Maura, shame on you. This isn't
			like you...
			It's alright...
			At least she's chewing them up in
			pairs.
			I'll arrange quarters for you.
			I'm sure you'd like some time
			alone...
			Actually... I've been stuck on
			that station for over nine
			months... I wouldn't mind going
			someplace with some activity.
			I know just the place.
			Have you ever tried Muskan seed
			punch?
			Yeah... it nearly made me sick.
			You have to be raised on it. It's
			very nutritious... and the taste
			grows on you.
			Batar al nalia. (But not on me)
			You speak Hahliian?
			Nelo, nelo... (a little, a little)
			Your accent is wonderful... almost
			flawless.
			Thanks... I've always had a knack
			for languages... probably because
			my folks moved around so much...
			We never travelled. My family has
			lived in the same house for five
			generations.
			The one on the hill?
			How did you know about that... ?
			Well... to be honest... when we
			thought you were dead... I had to
			review your logs... and your
			personal correspondence... for any
			possible clues about what
			happened.
			All of it?
			Most of it.
			You have to remember... we thought
			you'd been murdered. We needed
			information.
			I'm sorry... it's just that... I
			say things to my sister that I
			wouldn't say to anyone else. I
			guess I'm feeling a little...
			exposed.
			I'd feel the same way.
			Especially if I'd seen you in a
			(TECH) wig...
			I'm curious... now that you've met
			me... am I what you expected?
			I'm not sure. The woman I saw on
			those logs is very complicated.
			I think there's more to you than
			meets the eye, Lieutenant.
			In what way... ?
			Your relationship with Rocha, for
			example. He'd only been there
			five days... but there was already
			a lot of friction... and you
			almost seemed to delight in doing
			things that would upset him. Why
			would you take on extra com
			traffic... when you knew it would
			make him angry?
			Is that a personal question? Or
			part of a murder investigation?
			I don't know. Maybe both.
			Keith Rocha was obnoxious from the
			minute he reported for duty. He
			treated me as though I were
			beneath contempt.
			I dealt with him the best way I
			could. I felt like I had to
			battle him just to hold my own.
			But that doesn't mean I wanted him
			dead.
			Why do you think he attacked you?
			I don't know.
			Rocha's file is spotless. Two
			decorations for valor... three
			outstanding evaluations from his
			previous commanders...
			Doesn't sound like the same man
			Lieutenant Uhnari described.
			What have you found out about
			Uhnari?
			I checked into her record, too.
			Her last posting was on Deriben
			Five. I spoke with her commanding
			officer there. He said she's
			argumentative... quick to take
			offense. He told me that he
			transferred Uhnari to this relay
			station because she was hampering
			their efforts.
			To be honest, sir... I'm beginning
			to have doubts about her story.
			Why?
			I had Worf check the weapons
			locker on the relay station...
			there's a phaser missing.
			You think she lied?
			Lied... conveniently forgot... I'm
			not sure. I just think it's
			something we have to consider.
			As of now, we don't have
			sufficient evidence one way or the
			other... I want you to examine her
			shuttle... perhaps there's
			something there which will shed
			some light on her story.
			Aye sir.
			How much longer do you think the
			investigation will take?
			Hard to say. Maybe two or three
			more days...
			I know I'm a suspect in this
			murder. Let me ask you
			something...
			You watched my logs... you know me
			better than anyone here...
			Do I seem like the kind of person
			who could kill someone?
			No.
			I don't think I realized how much
			I needed to hear that...
			Aquiel... it's been a hard couple
			of days... I think you need some
			sleep.
			You called me complicated...
			you're right. And I don't make
			friends easily...
			Oumriel.
			Oumriel...
			I've managed to isolate the
			cellular residue from the metal of
			the deckplate. We've begun a full
			spectrum tissue scan...
			But something destabilized the DNA
			to such an extent, that I can't
			get a clear scan of it.
			Could a high level phaser blast
			have caused this kind of DNA
			disruption?
			Possibly. But it would take a
			continuous burst of thirty to
			forty seconds to cause this kind
			of damage.
			I'm going to try to reform the DNA
			with a resonance frequency
			burst... see if I can reconstruct
			it to get an accurate scan.
			Commander...
			It is set to kill.
			We found a type two phaser in your
			shuttlecraft. It was taken from
			the weapons locker on the station.
			I told you I don't remember what
			happened. Maybe I did get to the
			weapons locker...
			The phaser was set to level ten.
			Standard procedure requires that
			all phasers are set to level one
			when they're in storage.
			That means someone deliberately
			changed the setting.
			And there is the matter of your
			conflict with Lieutenant Rocha.
			Rocha and I had our
			disagreements... but I would
			never kill him...
			Have you been able to remember
			anything at all about what
			happened after he attacked you?
			No... nothing...
			I... suppose it's possible...
			maybe in self-defense I...
			Doctor Crusher tells me that in
			order to inflict the kind of
			molecular damage found in Rocha's
			remains... it would take a
			sustained phaser discharge of at
			least thirty to forty seconds.
			That doesn't sound like "self-defense"
			to me.
			Wait a minute. We haven't even
			established this phaser as the
			murder weapon yet.
			And even at level ten... I don't
			see how a phaser could do what the
			medical evidence says it did. A
			subspace disruptor like a Klingon
			weapon, maybe...
			Look -- we're not here to make
			accusations... Just to find out
			what happened.
			Commander Morag is due to arrive
			in two hours. We'll see what he
			has to say.
			I'd like to go back to the
			station... and try accessing
			Rocha's personal logs again.
			Good idea.
			Geordi... wait a second.
			This is off the record. I'm
			saying this as your friend, not
			your superior officer.
			It might be best if you weren't
			so... personally involved with
			Aquiel right now. There's a lot
			about her we don't know...
			There's a lot about her that I do
			know...
			If she's innocent... I'd like to
			help her prove it.
			I think you're letting your
			personal feelings cloud your
			judgement.
			I'm not the one making judgements.
			Got it...
			Computer -- display personal logs
			of Lieutenant Rocha. Stardates
			46455 to 46461.
			Computer -- what happened to the
			log entries for Stardate 46460?
			The logs have been deleted.
			Who deleted them?
			Unknown.
			Computer -- access internal
			records for Station forty-seven.
			Authorization La Forge Theta Nine
			Nine Two.
			Perform a command function trace
			on the instructions to delete the
			log entries.
			Captain's Log: Supplemental. The
			Qu'Vat has arrived with Commander
			Morag. We are preparing to
			question him regarding his
			involvement in the murder of
			Lieutenant Rocha.
			I killed no one!
			We found your DNA on the consoles,
			and on the bulkheads... we know
			you were there.
			Answer their questions.
			Yes...
			Yes, I was there. My patrol route
			takes me near the station every
			six days. Three days ago I hailed
			them and there was no response.
			I was... concerned.
			Concerned... ?
			Yes. I went aboard to see what
			had happened. No one was there,
			so I left.
			And that's all?
			That's all.
			Commander Morag, we have
			discovered that the encrypted
			message bank on the station has
			been tampered with. Our analysis
			indicates that twenty-seven
			priority Starfleet messages are
			missing.
			What of it?
			Your DNA was also found on the
			message control module.
			This is outrageous! We will not
			tolerate these accusations!
			This is a... diplomatic matter,
			Morag.
			Do not make me searcn your ship.
			Yes... I did take the messages...
			Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha?
			No. There was no one there. I
			saw blood... and signs of a
			struggle. I took the codes, but
			I killed no one.
			Governor, we would like Commander
			Morag to remain aboard the
			Enterprise until our investigation
			is complete.
			Take him.
			This way.
			Last night, after I dropped you
			off at your quarters...
			you established a subspace link
			with this console...
			You deleted some of Rocha's
			personal file... didn't you?
			Yes... I did.
			Why?
			I found... a letter Rocha was
			planning to send to Starfleet
			Command... about me.
			The letter said I had become
			belligerent... and insubordinate.
			He was going to ask for a formal
			hearing.
			Geordi, I know how this looks...
			Yeah -- it looks pretty bad.
			I find out you've erased a letter
			that contained a possible
			motivation for murder --
			I didn't kill him.
			Then explain this...
			I was afraid if they found the
			letter... I'd be blamed for the
			murder.
			I'm not a model officer, I realize
			that. Sometimes I act on impulse
			instead of thinking things
			through...
			Aquiel... this really complicates
			things...
			What are you doing?
			Getting out of here.
			Aquiel... running away isn't going
			to prove your innocence... facing
			the situation will.
			I'm scared, Geordi...
			We'll get through this. I
			promise...
			Then... you believe me?
			Yes. I do.
			Alright. Initiate the resonance
			frequency burst...
			I'm starting to get a stable DNA
			scan... this is odd...
			The nucleotide sequences are
			starting to fluctuate... the DNA
			is becoming motile.
			Let's try another frequency burst --
			increase the resonance level by
			twenty percent --
			What is it... ?
			We've... got a lot of work to
			do...
			I haven't felt this close to
			someone in a long time... I don't
			want to let go of it...
			Me neither...
			But we've got over six hundred
			logs to go through...
			Alright. But first... there's
			something I want to share with
			you. A way that we can become...
			more intimate.
			My people are partially
			telepathic... we use something
			called the Canar to help us focus
			our thoughts.
			We also use the Canar to establish
			a stronger emotional link
			during... love.
			I was wondering what that was...
			Do both of us have to be...
			telepathic for it to work?
			Let's find out.
			Go ahead...
			Think of me...
			It's a perfect reproduction of my
			hand -- all the way down to the
			DNA structure.
			You said it was formed from the
			organic matter found in the
			deckplate?
			When I infused the matter with a
			resonance frequency burst, it
			activated the DNA. Then it
			touched my hand... and started to
			mimic my cellular structure...
			Doctor... what exactly is this?
			It's going to sound pretty farfetched...
			Have you ever heard of coalescent
			organisms?
			No...
			Rare microscopic lifeforms which
			must absorb other organisms in
			order to survive. Now, that's not
			so unusual... but coalescents
			become the organism they've
			absorbed -- right down to the
			cellular level.
			Do you think that is what happened
			with your hand?
			There have been reports that these
			organisms can exist on a larger
			scale. What happened to my hand
			seems to support that theory.
			Are you saying that Lieutenant
			Rocha was killed by one of these --
			organisms?
			It's possible it happened before
			he reported for duty on the relay
			station.
			I do not understand.
			I've checked the records. Just
			before he was posted to the relay
			station, Rocha served on an
			outpost in the Triona System...
			That's in a remote sector... maybe
			he was absorbed by a coalescent
			during that mission...
			Then... what came aboard the
			station, was actually an organism
			that looked and acted like
			Rocha...
			How often must they change bodies?
			The microscopic organisms have a
			cycle of no more than five to ten
			seconds. We can only assume a
			larger, more complex coalescent
			would have a cycle of at least
			several days... or weeks.
			If what you're saying is true...
			Rocha attacked Uhnari because he
			needed a new body...
			Right.
			But that means... Uhnari's now a
			coalescent.
			There was another person on the
			station -- Morag. It is possible
			he was the one who was...
			absorbed.
			Computer -- locate Commander Morag
			and Lieutenant Uhnari.
			Commander Morag is in his
			quarters. Lieutenant Uhnari is
			not aboard the Enterprise.
			Where did she go?
			Lieutenant Uhnari transported to
			Relay Station Forty-Seven at
			eighteen thirty hours.
			You get Morag. I'm going to the
			station.
			Geordi... ?
			I can see you...
			And I can... feel you...
			Do not move.
			What is this -- ?
			Come with us.
			You've never been as close to
			someone as you're about to be...
			think of me...
			Step away from him, Lieutenant...
			slowly.
			What is it, Commander?
			That might not be Lieutenant
			Uhnari...
			What?
			What are you saying?
			Step away. Now.
			Chief Medical Officer's Log,
			supplemental. Commander Morag and
			Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept
			under close observation. So far,
			no sign of coalescent behavior has
			surfaced.
			Uhnari and Morag will be
			transferred to a secure medical
			facility at Starbase Two-twelve.
			Maybe we'll know more by the time

			Yeah... maybe...
			It might be Morag... there's no
			way to tell...
			Right...
			Get some rest. This has been a

			Maura... ?
			Maybe the reason you don't
			remember what happened after Rocha
			attacked you... is that the
			coalescing process had begun...
			remember you felt like the
			memories had been drained right
			out of you? That's probably just
			what happened...

			phaser...
			Whatever happened, at least you
			got away.
			So he turned on Maura.
			Well. What now?
			I guess I'll be going to Starbase
			Two-Twelve for re-assignment.
			You know... I had a talk with
			Chief Pendleton in Communications.
			There's an opening for a level two
			specialist.

			here.
			I could put in a good word.
			It's an appealing offer...
			But I think I'd rather get here on
			my own merits.
			Don't be surprised if you see my
			name at the end of that list.
