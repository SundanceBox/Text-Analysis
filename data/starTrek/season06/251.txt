			You really did it this time, Wil.
			It's not just a scrape... it's a
			deep cut.
			I can heal it... but it would
			serve you right if I didn't.
			You can't keep playing Parises
			Squares like you're twenty-one
			years old. One of these days
			you're going to fall and break
			your neck... and I won't be able
			to heal that so easily.
			Actually... I wasn't playing
			Parises Squares...
			Mmm... Worf's calisthenic program
			again...
			No...
			Oh? What were you doing?
			I was trying to feed Spot.
			Data's cat?
			I told Data I'd feed it while he
			was away...
			All I remember is setting down the
			food... and then a hissing ball of
			fur came out of nowhere.
			I hate cats.
			You've just got to know how to
			handle them.
			Maybe you'd like to feed Spot.
			I'd be happy to...
			Commander Riker to the Bridge.
			On my way.
			Oh, and Doctor...
			You're going to need this.
			Report.
			We are picking up a distress call
			on the long range sensors.
			It is Romulan, sir.
			Romulan?
			They claim they have suffered a
			complete engine failure. Their
			power levels are dropping... and
			their life support is failing.
			It could be a trick.
			How long until our rendezvous with
			Captain Picard?
			Approximately thirteen hours.
			Set course for the Romulan ship,
			Mister Worf.
			Raise our shields, and go to Red
			Alert. I want to be ready for
			anything.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46944.2.
			Commander Data, Mister La Forge,
			Counselor Troi and I are en route
			to the Enterprise, after attending
			a three day conference on the
			psychological effects of long-term
			deep space assignments.
			Computer -- activate automatic
			helm control.
			Helm control activated.
			So just as I'm leaving the
			reception, a Ktarian walks up to
			me and says...
			"So Diane... I understand you're
			an empath. I'm a very...
			sensitive man myself. I'm doing
			a thesis on interspecies mating
			rituals. Would you care to join
			me in some empirical research?"
			Don't tell me -- Doctor Mizan.
			That's right.
			He's notorious. But he really is
			an expert on interspecies mating
			practices.
			Did you help him with his
			research, Counselor?
			Absolutely not.
			But I thought that topic
			interested you.
			Yes... but...
			I'll explain it to you later,
			Data.
			What did you think of the rest of
			the conference?
			To be honest... I was bored. I
			spent most of my time in Doctor
			Wagner's phylobiology seminar.
			I thought the idea of a seminar
			was that we would all
			participate... bring different
			points of views to the
			discussion...
			He gathered two hundred scientists
			from all over the Federation...
			and all he did was put us to
			sleep.
			I have a memory record of the
			entire lecture, Counselor. I can
			repeat the portions you missed, if
			you --
			No thank you, Data.
			It wasn't any better at the
			physiognomy workshop. Doctor
			Vassbinder gave an hour long
			dissertation on the ionization
			effect of warp nacelles -- before
			he realized the topic was supposed
			to be psychology.
			Why didn't somebody tell him?
			There was never an opportunity --
			never a pause. He just kept
			talking... like he was speaking
			in one incredibly long, run-on
			sentence.
			It was almost... hypnotic.
			Well, I had a good time. The warp
			energy symposium was fascinating.
			I actually got the chance to touch
			a plasma field.
			Really. What was it like?
			Incredible. I could feel the
			plasma crawling up my arm. It was
			warm... and it gave off a
			tingling sensation that --
			Captain?
			Data... ?
			-- went all the way down my chest.
			It was kind of like taking a bath
			in pure energy.
			It was not painful?
			Not at all. In fact...
			Is there something wrong,
			Counselor?
			I'm... not sure...
			Our bio-scans check out. There
			are no physiological anomalies.
			If something did happen, it didn't
			leave any biological traces.
			How long did it appear to you that
			we were... frozen?
			I don't know... four, maybe five
			seconds. You just... stopped...
			and then started again...
			I can't explain it...
			My memory record does not indicate
			a pause or disruption during that
			period of time.
			My internal chronometer and the
			ship's computer are perfectly
			synchronized. There does not
			appear to be a temporal
			discrepancy.
			Data -- let's run a ship-wide
			diagnostic. Maybe there's
			something we missed...
			Let's go through it again. You
			were sitting there... and we were
			sitting here...
			Describe the exact moment when
			things appeared to freeze.
			Geordi was talking about what it
			felt like to touch the plasma
			field... You were lifting the
			cup, about to take a drink...
			Did you sense anything from us
			during that time? Any unusual
			emotions?
			No... not a thing. I was
			empathically aware of you, right
			up to the moment you froze, but
			then it all stopped...
			The past few days have been
			exhausting. Maybe it was my
			imagination...
			There were moments in that lecture
			hall when I thought time was
			standing still, too...
			There is another possibility,
			Counselor. Perhaps this was
			nothing more than a simple --
			Are you alright?
			What happened?
			You have been motionless for three
			minutes, eleven seconds.
			Motionless... ?
			It appears to be the same effect
			you described to us.
			Can you remember anything?
			No... one second I was sitting
			here talking with you... the next,
			you were all standing around me.
			Wait a second... this is weird...
			What is it?
			I had the tricorder run a
			comparison between the bio-scan I
			took of you earlier... and the one
			I took just now...
			In the time between the two scans,
			you should have aged twenty-three
			minutes. But according to your
			cellular decay levels... you've
			only aged twenty minutes.
			What could account for the
			discrepancy?
			I don't know, sir. It's as if for
			three minutes, time stopped for
			Counselor Troi.
			Mister Data -- contact the
			Enterprise. Tell Commander Riker
			to get to the rendezvous point as
			soon as possible. Have him begin
			scanning the region for temporal
			anomalies.
			Aye sir.
			I'll take a look at the sensor
			logs... see if I can find
			anything.
			Captain.
			The Enterprise is not responding
			to our hails.
			Are we within sensor range yet?
			No sir.
			Increase speed to the rendezvous
			coordinates.
			Aye sir.
			We have an engine failure warning
			in the --
			Report!
			The starboard nacelle just cut
			out!
			Attitude control has been
			restored.
			Full stop.
			What happened?
			The starboard antimatter pod is
			completely drained. The fuel
			reserves are empty.
			Is there a containment leak?
			No sir. The containment field is
			intact... all engine systems are
			operational... The fuel is just
			gone.
			Geordi -- I believe I have an
			explanation. According to the
			plasma conversion sensor, the
			starboard engine has been in
			continuous operation for over
			forty-seven days.
			Forty-seven days? Let's take a
			look at that sensor -- it must be
			malfunctioning.
			I'll check the fuel consumption
			logs...
			What happened?
			My hand...
			The cells in your hand are
			metabolizing at an incredible
			rate... almost fifty times
			normal...
			The pain is going away...
			Your metabolism is stabilizing...
			It happened when I reached for the
			bowl of fruit.
			Captain. I am detecting a
			temporal disturbance which
			intersects the table.
			It would appear that within this
			disturbance, time is moving at a
			highly accelerated rate --
			approximately fifty times faster
			than normal.
			The disturbance is roughly
			spherical in shape. It extends
			outward through the hull,
			approximately seventeen meters
			beyond the ship.
			That would cover the starboard
			nacelle. No wonder it used up all
			its fuel.
			Check the hull integrity.
			It does not appear to be affected.
			See if you can move us away from
			the disturbance, Mister La Forge.
			Aye sir.
			Lateral thrusters on-line...
			Data, plot a course away from the
			disturbance. Make sure it doesn't
			come in contact with our other
			engine.
			Course plotted. Adjust pitch to
			twenty-seven point three degrees.
			Set heading one-eight-zero mark
			zero.
			Got it. Reversing at fifteen
			meters per second...
			We are clearing the phenomenon...
			All stop.
			What's the matter?
			There is another temporal
			disturbance directly behind us.
			Captain, you'd better take a look
			at this...
			The sensors are picking up
			temporal disturbances throughout
			the region. Different
			configurations... different
			sizes... they're everywhere.
			Within each disturbance, it
			appears that time is moving at a
			different rate.
			It's almost like something
			shattered the space-time
			continuum...
			The fragmentation effect increases
			along a heading of two-seven-zero
			mark one-five.
			That's the direction of the
			Enterprise.
			Can we navigate around these...
			"fragments"?
			We'll have to limit our
			maneuvering speed to one half
			impulse... but I think we can do
			it.
			Get us to the Enterprise.
			These are the coordinates...
			Perhaps they've been delayed...
			I've got the long range sensors on
			maximum, sir. No sign of the
			Enterprise.
			But... I am picking up a faint
			reading... possibly metallic, but
			I can't tell for sure...
			The energy levels are practically
			non-existent.
			Take us to it.
			Aye sir...
			The fragmentation effect is
			increasing...
			Slowing to one eighth impulse...
			There she is...
			My God...
			Mister Data... ?
			The Enterprise and the Warbird
			both appear to be trapped within
			one of the temporal fragments.
			The fragments seem to converge at
			this point... I'd say we're
			looking at the center of the
			temporal disturbances.
			Scan for life signs.
			Sensors cannot penetrate the
			subspace field. I am unable to
			scan within the vessels.
			It looks like the Enterprise has
			been damaged...
			There, on the starboard nacelle...
			The Warbird doesn't look damaged
			at all... I wonder if the
			Enterprise even got off a shot...
			The Romulans could've decloaked
			before the Enterprise had a chance
			to respond...
			There's a second energy beam.
			It's coming from the Enterprise
			deflector array... any idea what
			it could be?
			It is impossible to tell from a
			visual inspection. But it appears
			to be focused on the Warbird's
			Engineering section.
			We're not going to figure out what
			happened from here. We need to
			get aboard the Enterprise.
			That would be unadvisable, sir.
			In each of the three instances we
			came into contact with a temporal
			fragment, we were integrated into
			its time frame.
			If we beamed aboard the
			Enterprise, we'd be frozen in
			time, just like they are.
			Then we've got to find a way to
			stay unfrozen...
			Mister La Forge... what about a
			subspace forcefield like the one
			we used on Devidia Two? Could
			something like that protect us
			from the effects of the temporal
			fragment?
			Possibly. But we'd need a pretty
			sensitive phase discriminator to
			modulate that kind of field...
			The emergency Transporter armbands
			contain a type-seven phase
			discriminator. It should be
			possible to reconfigure their
			subspace emitters.
			Yeah... that would certainly
			isolate us from the effects of the
			other time frame...
			But if we want to interact with
			that environment... we'd have to
			restrict the field. It would have
			to be practically skin-tight.
			I will attempt to narrow the
			field.
			This might work, Captain. But
			it's going to take some time...
			It would seem that time is one
			thing we have plenty of...
			I've channeled communications
			through the subspace relays in the
			armbands. We'll be in continual
			contact.
			How long will the fields last?
			An hour, maybe less. Don't worry.
			I'll monitor you very carefully...
			Is there something wrong,
			Counselor?
			I got a little dizzy there for a
			second...
			We're generating an artificial
			pocket of time around you -- it's
			probably playing tricks on your
			equilibrium...
			It might take a little while to
			get used to. Let me know if it
			gets any worse.
			Beam us directly to the Enterprise
			Bridge.
			Aye sir.
			Energizing...
			Three Romulans... all armed with
			disruptors... one at Conn...
			There are none of our security
			officers on the Bridge. They
			must've taken us by surprise....
			It would appear that we can move
			objects in this time frame.
			Maybe we can do something to help
			Wil...
			I'm wary about making changes in
			this time continuum until we
			understand more about what's going
			on.
			None of the equipment is
			functioning.
			However, the information currently
			displayed indicates that there was
			a massive power surge in
			Engineering.
			Security teams had just been sent
			to Transporter Room Three... and
			Sickbay.
			Counselor -- you go to Sickbay.
			Have a look around. Data, go to
			Main Engineering -- see if you can
			determine the cause of the power
			surge. I'll be in Transporter
			Room Three.
			Picard to La Forge.
			La Forge here, sir.
			Lock onto our signals. I want you
			to beam Counselor Troi to --
			I'd rather not, Captain. We've
			got limited power... and your
			isolation fields consume a lot of
			energy.
			Understood. We'll use the
			Jefferies Tubes.
			Let's go.
			T-Sixteen is directly ahead --
			it's the main junction for this
			section of the ship. We should
			have reasonably easy access to our
			destinations from there...
			Maybe we can get around them...
			No. We'll find an alternate
			route.
			Let's go back up.
			Excuse me, Mister Worf...
			Captain...
			Counselor. Take a look at this...
			It appears that Mister Worf had
			just beamed these three aboard...
			According to this, three other
			Romulans were beamed directly to
			Sickbay just seconds before.
			I know. I just saw them...
			Why would we be transporting
			Romulans onto our ship in the
			middle of a battle?
			They don't have any weapons... and
			that one looks injured. If they
			were part of an invasion, why are
			they unarmed? It doesn't make
			sense...
			Captain... there's something I
			have to tell you...
			Doctor Crusher has been hit by a
			disruptor blast at point blank
			range... if time returns to
			normal, I don't see how she can
			survive.
			There must be something we can
			do...
			Data to Captain Picard.
			Picard here.
			Please come to Engineering
			immediately. It is urgent.
			What's the problem, Mister Data?
			I believe I have discovered the
			cause of the power surge.
			There is a warp core breach in
			progress.
			It is the flashpoint of a warp
			core explosion.
			And it is expanding.
			Expanding... I thought time was
			suspended on this ship.
			We were incorrect. I have
			determined that time is moving
			forward at an infinitesimal rate.
			Why didn't we notice it before?
			Our initial conclusion was based
			on our observations of the crew.
			A warp core breach moves at a much
			faster rate.
			The motion of the cloud is within
			my visual detection threshold.
			Based on its current expansion
			rate, it will consume the ship in
			approximately nine hours,
			seventeen minutes.
			Is there any way we can stop it?
			It is no longer a question of
			stopping it, sir. The explosion
			has already occurred -- The fact
			that it is moving slowly changes
			nothing.
			Astonishing... to see it frozen
			like this...
			Do we know what caused the breach?
			No. However, the console displays
			indicate that there was a power
			transfer in progress from the
			Enterprise to the Romulan vessel
			at the moment time decelerated.
			That is why there is a second beam
			between the two ships.
			Why would we be sending them
			power?
			Perhaps we should go aboard the
			Romulan ship. The answer to that
			question may --
			Captain?
			Captain, what's wrong?
			My head... dizzy... I can't...
			No!
			Troi to La Forge. Get us out of
			here, now!
			It looks like you weren't
			completely protected from the
			effects of the other time
			continuum...
			The neuro-physical stress must've
			been overwhelming.
			In much the same way that deep sea
			divers can experience nitrogen
			narcosis -- you experienced a form
			of temporal narcosis.
			Can we modify the subspace
			isolators to give us better
			protection?
			I don't think so. All we can do
			right now is be careful -- limit
			our exposure to their time frame.
			We probably shouldn't stay any
			longer than ten minutes per trip.
			And we should stick together while
			we're there... just in case.
			Very well. Our next step is to
			find out why the Enterprise was
			transferring power to the Romulan
			ship.
			We'll begin our search in their
			engine room. Counselor -- you
			spent several days on a Romulan
			ship -- you know more about their
			lay-outs than anyone here.
			Perhaps you can --
			Captain. It might be better if
			you stayed here this time and gave
			yourself a chance to recover.
			You're right...
			I'll monitor your progress from
			here. Ten minutes... no more.
			Geordi, there should be a power
			utilization monitor over there...
			This is highly unusual. The crew
			is not at Battle Stations. The
			ship is on Evacuation Alert.
			Is that why Romulans were being
			transported to the Enterprise... ?
			Take a look at this...
			There's an energy feedback
			returning through the transfer
			beam. It's probably what
			overloaded the Enterprise's
			engine... and caused the core
			breach.
			Perhaps the Warbird was trying to
			destroy the Enterprise.
			I don't think so. According to
			this, the Romulans were trying to
			shut down the power transfer.
			Whatever happened, this is
			beginning to look less and less
			like a Romulan attack...
			Let's take a look at their engine
			output.
			Geordi -- the engine core is
			completely inactive.
			That's impossible. The Romulans
			use an artificial quantum
			singularity as their power source.
			Once it's activated, it can't be
			shut down.
			Maybe we should take a closer
			look....
			I think we found the problem...
			It appears to be a highly focused
			aperture in the space-time
			continuum. Its energy signature
			matches that of the temporal
			fragments we observed earlier.
			However, it is approximately one
			point two million times as
			intense.
			I believe this may be the origin
			of the temporal fragmentation.
			What are these dark spots?
			I am not certain. They exhibit
			complex bio-electric patterns.
			Very possibly organic.
			Organic?
			From their molecular
			configuration, it would seem --
			The aperture is beginning to
			fluctuate. I believe we are --
			I believe my tricorder emissions
			caused the temporal aperture to
			activate. I suggest we avoid
			exposing it to any further energy
			emissions.
			When time resumed, did you observe
			any activity in the engine room
			that suggested what the Romulans
			were doing?
			It appeared they were trying to
			eject the engine core.
			I thought I heard one of the
			Engineers say something about the
			power transfer. Something about
			an energy feedback...
			It looks like they were trying to
			stop whatever was happening
			here...
			Mister La Forge -- from where you
			are can you determine what's
			happening on the Romulan Bridge?
			I think so...
			Wait... something's different
			here...
			Data... was this man always
			standing right here --
			He's going into neural shock!
			We must get him back to the
			Runabout.
			There's not enough time -- he's
			dying.
			At least this way, he'll be alive
			in the other time frame... we
			might have a chance to save him
			later.
			Is the Romulan still alive?
			Yes. However, I am getting
			unusual readings from his bioscan.
			I am not sure that he is a
			Romulan.
			His cellular structures do not
			conform to any known species, and
			his bio-electric patterns are in
			a state of temporal flux.
			I do not believe that this being
			is native to our time continuum.
			Mister Data... you said you
			discovered organic matter within
			the temporal aperture...
			That is correct.
			I want to take a closer look at
			those readings.
			This is a bio-spectral analysis of
			the temporal aperture.
			The organic readings originated
			from these dark spots.
			They appear to contain some sort
			of energy patterns...
			Can you isolate one of them and
			magnify?
			It looks like a cellular
			cluster...
			Its bio-electric patterns are
			similar to that of the alien.
			However, it is significantly less
			complex.
			The cellular structures appear to
			be in a state of mitosis.
			Data. This could be some sort
			of... embryo...
			It is possible. If I could scan
			the aperture further, I might be
			able to --
			Captain.
			Must... save... no...
			Who are you?
			This body is... not mine... it was
			necessary to assume it... to exist
			in your... time...
			Why are you here?
			We had to come... to save them...
			they were... in danger...
			Who was in danger?
			Our young... they will die... in
			the gravity well... it is
			artificial...
			Artificial... gravity well...
			You mean, the Romulan engine core?
			Yes... our young... are trapped...
			We must get them out... return
			them to our time...
			His molecular structure is
			destabilizing.
			How did your young become trapped
			in the core?
			We must use a natural gravity
			well... to incubate our young...
			We thought the Romulan core...
			would suffice... it did not...
			Captain -- I believe his species
			mistook the artificial
			singularity, which the Romulans
			use in their engine, for a natural
			one... a black hole. They tried
			to use it as a nest.
			That's what deactivated the
			Warbird's engine core... so the
			Romulans sent out a distress
			call...
			The Enterprise responded... found
			the Warbird suffering an apparent
			engine failure... and attempted a
			power transfer.
			Power transfer... we must stop the
			power transfer... it has...
			ruptured time... it will
			destroy... our young...
			I believe that when the power
			transfer made contact with the
			alien nest, it disrupted the space-time
			continuum.
			Was it you who attacked the
			Enterprise?
			Yes... we had to stop the power
			transfer...
			Are there others like you here?
			One other...
			Do you know where he is? Can he
			help us restore normal time?
			I estimate the core breach will
			consume the Enterprise in
			approximately seven hours, two
			minutes.
			Is there a way to lock onto the
			core itself... beam it into space?
			No, sir. We would need to
			surround the core with a subspace
			isolation field. It is not
			possible to generate a field of
			that magnituide from the Runabout.
			Mister Data... when you scanned
			the temporal aperture with your
			tricorder... it caused time to
			move forward, and back again...
			That is correct.
			What if we found a way to reverse
			that process -- make time move
			backward... then forward.
			We might be able to run time back
			to a point before the warp core
			breach occurred... and then find
			a way to prevent the power
			transfer. So when time moves
			forward again...
			... The breach won't happen.
			I can attempt to modify the
			tricorder's scan frequency. It
			might allow us to manipulate the
			temporal aperture's effects.
			Make it so, Data.
			If this works, we may not have
			much time to prevent the power
			transfer. We'll have to decide
			precisely where to be and what to
			do the instant time begins to move
			backwards...
			Captain -- I have placed the
			tricorder in the Romulan engine
			room. Standing by.
			Acknowledged. Counselor -- are
			you in position?
			Ready, sir.
			Alright, Mister Data.
			Initiating tricorder emissions...
			Captain -- the warp core breach
			has been reversed.
			Be ready, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			You must stop!
			You must not initiate the power
			transfer.
			I'm sorry, sir. I already have.
			We must shut it down.
			The transfer beam is at
			saturation, sir -- it can't be
			disengaged.
			Computer -- place a Level three
			containment field around the warp
			core.
			Containment field activated.
			Captain?
			No time to explain, Number One.
			Continue the evacuation of the
			Romulan ship. You'll find LaForge
			in the Romulan engine room --
			beam him directly to Sickbay.
			Step away -- now.
			Deanna, it's okay -- he wasn't
			firing at me.
			There was an alien here... who'd
			taken Romulan form. I was firing
			at her...
			The doctor got in the way.
			Where did she go... ?
			Status, Mister Data?
			I was attacked by another alien,
			sir. I was unable to prevent the
			power transfer.
			It cannot be disengaged and the
			containment field will fail in
			seventeen seconds.
			A core breach is again imminent.
			Can we move the ship?
			The feedback from the transfer
			beam would tear us apart.
			Patch me into the navigational
			control on the Runabout.
			Got it!
			I'm bringing the Runabout in...
			Mister Data?
			The core breach has been
			prevented, sir.
			Data -- it appears that severing
			the power transfer has not only
			prevented the core breach, but has
			also restored space-time to
			normal.
			The alien who attacked me has
			vanished, sir.
			The Warbird has vanished as well.
			Judging from the residual temporal
			fluctuations... I believe they
			have returned to their own time
			continuum.
			Captain?
			It's going to take a little time
			to explain, Number One...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46945.3.
			We successfully evacuated the crew
			of the Romulan ship. We're on
			course to the Neutral Zone to
			bring them home.
			Come in.
			Where's that cat of yours?
			Spot is sleeping, sir. Why do you
			ask?
			No reason...
			I've worked out the new rotation
			schedules. I'd like you to cross
			check the personnel assignments
			and notify all department heads.
			Your new Bridge shift begins at
			twenty-three hundred hours.
			Understood, sir.
			Data, what are you doing?
			Recent events have compelled me to
			study how humans perceive the
			passage of time.
			For example, I have often heard
			people comment that time seems to
			pass more "slowly" in one
			instance, or more "quickly" in
			another. Yet in reality, the
			actual passage of time remains
			fixed.
			I guess everybody perceives time
			a little differently... it depends
			on the exact situation... how
			you're feeling...
			I have been testing the aphorism
			that "a watched pot never boils".
			I have boiled the same amount of
			water in this kettle sixty-two
			times. In some cases, I ignored
			the kettle.
			In others, I watched it intently.
			In every instance, the water
			reached its boiling point in
