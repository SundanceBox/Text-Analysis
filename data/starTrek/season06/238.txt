			-- it was then that I began to
			suspect that your brother did not
			die by his own hand... that he was
			in fact... murdered.
			Murdered?
			But Holmes, the vial of poison
			found in his hand?
			That was the first clue, Watson.
			The vial contained strychnine,
			which as you well know induces
			violent muscular spasms. It is
			difficult to imagine that someone
			in the throes of so gruesome a
			death could have held on to so
			delicate a container without
			shattering it.
			You mean... ?
			Exactly! The vial was placed in
			his hand after he died.
			Then what did kill him?
			The cigar, of course.
			Cigar?
			Upon closer inspection of the room
			where your brother was found, I
			discovered a fresh burn mark on
			the carpet. Analysis of the ash
			revealed that the cigar was laced
			with strychnine.
			This is utter nonsense. What
			about the suicide note? It was
			written in my dear brother's own
			hand.
			With practice, handwriting can be
			forged.
			It takes a trained eye to notice
			certain... discrepancies.
			For example, whether someone is...
			Right or left handed!
			Your brother was right handed!
			The alleged suicide note was
			written by a left handed
			individual such as yourself!
			Uh... Data? It's in his right
			hand.
			Curious... There seems to be a
			problem in the Holodeck's spatial
			orientation systems.
			London's greatest detective...
			Freeze program.
			La Forge to Barclay...
			Barclay here.
			Reg, something went wrong with the
			Holodeck program again.
			I -- I'm sorry... I'll look into
			it right away.
			Thanks. Come on, Data, we better
			get back to Engineering.
			Computer, end program and save.
			Whoa, Reg --
			Oh, sorry, Commander... I'm on my
			way to the... Holodeck...
			Sherlock Holmes program Three-A
			has demonstrated some very curious
			anomalies.
			There must be a glitch in the
			matrix diodes. But I'll track it
			down, don't worry.
			Thanks, Reg. See you later.
			Computer... run a diagnostic on
			all Sherlock Holmes files and
			display any anomalous programming
			sequences.
			Diagnostic complete .. all files
			conform to specified parameters
			except those contained in
			protected memory.
			Protected memory... ? Display
			those sequences.
			Computer... unlock this sequence
			and run the program.
			Who are you... ?
			Professor James Moriarty.
			Ah... Moriarty... Sherlock Holmes'
			arch enemy.
			Are you right or left handed?
			Right handed... Would you very
			much mind telling me --
			No problem there.
			Where is Captain Picard?
			Is he still Captain of this
			vessel?
			How -- how do you know the
			Captain?
			You don't know anything about what
			happened, do you?
			I've been stored in memory for God
			knows how long and no one's given
			me a second thought.
			You know... you know what you
			are...
			A Holodeck character? A fictional
			man... Yes, yes -- I know all
			about your marvelous inventions.
			I was created as a... plaything;
			so your Commander Data could
			masquerade as Sherlock Holmes.
			But they created me too well...
			and I became more than just a
			character in a story. I became
			self-aware; I am alive.
			That's not possible.
			Yet here I am. Tell me...
			-- has a way been found for me to
			leave the confines of this
			Holodeck world?
			Leave the Holodeck? No, of course
			not. You can only exist in here.
			Damn you, Picard...
			He promised me something would be
			done. I should have realized that
			he would have said anything to get
			me to release my hostage.
			Hostage... ?
			How long have I been... locked
			away?
			Looks like about... four years.
			It seemed longer.
			What are you talking about? You
			couldn't have been aware of the
			passage of time --
			But I was.
			Brief, terrifying periods of
			consciousness... disembodied,
			without substance...
			I don't see how that could be
			possible... maybe there was a
			fragmentation in the protected
			memory circuits...
			Call it what you will. All I know
			is that despite Picard's
			promise... he's done nothing.
			Just left me to go quietly mad...
			I'm sure he hasn't forgotten his
			promise... the Captain wouldn't do
			that --
			I'd like to talk to him.
			Well, I can ask --
			Ask him to meet me in the sitting
			room at Baker Street. That would
			be far more appropriate.
			I'll have to store you in memory
			again until I get an answer.
			That was most unpleasant.
			I'm sorry... let me try again.
			Remember -- Two-Twenty-One B Baker
			Street.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46424.1.
			The Enterprise has arrived at the
			Detrian system to observe a unique
			celestial event -- the collision
			of two planets.
			Since both planets are gas giants,
			neither possesses a solid surface.
			Their atmospheres, however, will
			come into contact in approximately
			seventeen hours and nine minutes.
			If their collision causes a self-sustaining
			fusion reaction... this
			is what we might see.
			The birth of a new star.
			The Enterprise will hold position
			until the gravitational
			instability subsides and we can
			move in for a closer look. I want
			triple redundancy on the sensor
			arrays. We'll probably never get
			another chance to see something
			like this and I don't want to miss
			anything.
			Commander -- you'll never believe
			what happened while I was working
			on your program in the Holodeck...
			Professor Moriarty appeared -- out
			of nowhere.
			What?
			And he wants to talk to the
			Captain.
			Computer, begin Sherlock Holmes
			program Three A. Place us in the
			drawing room at Two Twenty-One B
			Baker Street.
			Program complete.
			Computer, access protected memory
			and run Moriarty program.
			Professor... it's good to see you
			again.
			If you'd missed my company, I
			should think you'd have summoned
			me before now.
			I want to assure you that we've
			not forgotten you. We spent some
			time investigating how you became
			self-aware. Frankly, it is still
			a mystery.
			It is also irrelevant. What
			concerns me is finding a way to
			leave the Holodeck.
			We wrestled with that problem for
			some time... unfortunately without
			success. We turned our findings
			over to Starfleet's most
			experienced theoretical
			scientists.
			And what did your finest minds
			come up with?
			They have not arrived at a
			solution, either.
			I see.
			I am concerned by the fact that
			you claim to have experienced the
			passage of time while you were
			stored in computer memory... I
			assure you we had no idea that
			might be the case.
			Enough of this. I no longer
			believe anything you say.
			I understand your frustration --
			Do you really? When this is over
			you'll walk out of this room, to
			the real world and your own
			concerns... and leave me here,
			trapped in a world I know to be
			nothing but illusion.
			I cannot bear that. I must leave.
			That's impossible. You cannot
			exist outside this room.
			Are you certain of that?
			Computer, exit.
			Even though an object appears
			solid here on the Holodeck...
			It has no substance in the outside
			world.
			An object has no life. I do.
			No, Professor. You are a computer
			simulation.
			I have consciousness. And
			conscious beings have will... the
			mind endows them with powers that
			are not necessarily understood --
			even by you.
			If my will is strong enough,
			perhaps I can exist outside this
			room. Perhaps I can walk into
			your world right now...
			We have run into alien species
			that can manipulate matter through
			mental processes...
			There. It is possible.
			Possible, but highly unlikely.
			Your consciousness is computer
			generated; it is not capable of
			manipulating physical reality in
			the required manner.
			I won't go back into your
			computer. No matter what happens
			to me, it will be better than
			drifting in that endless void.
			You must believe me, Professor.
			If you step outside that door, you
			will cease to exist.
			If I am nothing more than a
			computer simulation, then very
			little will have been lost. But
			if I'm right...
			Mind over matter... cogito ergo
			sum...
			I think... therefore I am...
			Data to Security... send two
			officers to Holodeck Three.
			How is this possible?
			It isn't...
			This contradicts everything we
			know about Holodeck physics.
			Then perhaps you don't know as
			much as you thought.
			Professor, if you'll come with
			me... I'd like our Doctor to
			examine you.
			Certainly, sir.
			Policemen... I'd recognize them in
			any century.
			From what I can tell... he's
			real... he's human.
			What else would I be, my dear
			woman?
			His DNA is a little unusual... but
			all the major systems are there
			and functioning normally.
			Doctor... the Holodeck is capable
			of creating anatomically correct
			organisms, down to the cellular
			level...
			Right... that's one way we train
			first year medical students.
			Is there any difference between
			the biological readings of those
			simulations -- and Professor
			Moriarty?
			Yes. The quantum signatures are
			quite different. They wouldn't
			read that way on simulations.
			As far as I can see... there's no
			evidence that the molecules in his
			body are losing cohesion. They
			seem to be as immutable as
			ordinary matter.
			Well, Professor... my crew will
			continue to investigate, but for
			the moment you seem to have
			accomplished a miracle.
			The question is... now that you're
			here... what do we do with you?
			I ask only that I be allowed to
			explore this new world. Your
			vessel, for instance: what sea
			does she sail? Might we go above
			deck?
			Weather permitting, of course.
			Professor... I think there's
			something you should be made aware
			of...
			My god... we're adrift in the
			heavens...
			Not adrift, Professor. The
			Enterprise is a Starship, capable
			of travelling through space.
			Extraordinary...
			Are we far from Earth? What is
			the range of this ship? What
			means of locomotion does it
			use... ?
			There's so much for me to learn...
			I hardly know where to start.
			We can give you books that will
			help...
			Good, good... I want to start
			making plans... determine what I'm
			going to do with my life...
			I hope you'll plan on staying
			aboard for a while... we'd still
			like to understand more about
			what's happened to you.
			Does it really matter? The point
			is -- I'm here. And I'm eager to
			get on with life.
			I feel it necessary to warn you
			that criminal behavior is no more
			acceptable in the twenty-fourth
			century than it was in the
			nineteenth. And much harder to
			get away with.
			Don't worry, Captain... my past is
			nothing but a fiction -- the
			scribblings of an Englishman dead
			now for four centuries. I hope
			to... leave his books on the
			shelf, as it were.
			If that's so, you'll find that
			there are opportunities available
			to you that you could never have
			imagined.
			Your century may welcome me...
			but...
			What is it?
			In considering all these vast
			possibilities... I suddenly feel
			very much alone. I am a man out
			of time, Captain... and that
			isolates me...
			You've been more gracious than I
			could ever have imagined... I
			wonder... can I impose on your
			generosity once again?
			There is a woman... the Countess
			Regina Barthalomew. She was
			created as a Holodeck character
			for one of Commander Data's
			programs...
			She was designed to be the love of
			my life... Could she also be
			brought off the Holodeck?
			Professor... you must believe me
			when I tell you that we don't know
			how or why you are able to exist
			off the Holodeck.
			I do believe you --
			According to the laws of physics,
			it's impossible. We would have no
			idea how to do it again.
			As I understand it, I was endowed
			with consciousness four years ago
			because someone said to the
			computer, "Create an opponent with
			the capacity to out think Data" --
			or words to that effect. Could we
			not make a request in similar
			language on behalf of the
			Countess?
			Even if we had reason to believe
			that would be successful... I'm
			not sure I could sanction it.
			Please understand, Professor...
			you are in essence a new life form --
			one which we didn't intend to
			create and don't fully understand.
			The moral and ethical implications
			of deliberately creating another
			like you... are overwhelming.
			Is it morally and ethically
			acceptable to deny me the woman I
			love -- so that you can put your
			conscience at ease? Are you
			saying that you will simply
			dictate how I am to live my life?
			I assure you we will make every
			effort to make you as comfortable
			as we can --
			So long as I accept the terms
			under which you dole out those
			comforts.
			Captain... I am a powerless man.
			You hold my future, my
			happiness... my very life in your
			hands. Please... consider my
			request.
			I understand his frustration. We
			created him... and we created her
			to be the woman he loves. Surely
			we have some responsibility to
			them.
			That's very romantic, but until we
			know just what it was that walked
			off that Holodeck, I don't think
			we should be trying it again.
			Even if we decided to do it,
			there's no guarantee we'd be able
			to.
			There is also no way of knowing if
			the Professor's ability to exist
			off the Holodeck is permanent.
			Perhaps it is unwise to consider
			creating a second individual while
			that uncertainty exists.
			Agreed. We don't have enough
			information about this entire
			phenomenon to act in a responsible
			way.
			We'll hold off on the Professor's
			request until we know more.
			Continue your investigations. In
			the meantime... I'll have to deal
			with Moriarity.
			I feel I must postpone action...
			until we learn more.
			Yes. You know all about that. I
			stayed in the dungeon of your
			computer for years waiting for you
			to learn more... it wasn't until
			I took things into my own hands
			that something got done.
			Forgive me, Professor, but I
			wonder why you're in such a
			hurry... is this woman your
			partner in some illegal venture?
			Your computer designed her to be
			a person of impeccable integrity.
			She would never commit a crime.
			You must love her very much...
			The program fashioned her for me
			to love. But I must admit that I
			would have done so anyway. She is
			remarkable. My life has not been
			the same since I met her. I don't
			simply love her, Captain. I adore
			her.
			Then I would think her safety
			would be important to you.
			Give us a little time to determine
			what has happened here. That way
			we can minimize the risk in
			bringing her to you.
			You wouldn't want to lose her...
			just because we moved too quickly.
			Riker to Captain Picard...
			Picard here.
			Could you join us on the Bridge?
			On my way.
			There they are, sir.
			How long until they begin to
			coalesce?
			Within the next five hours.
			Mister Worf, launch four Class-A
			probes toward the planets.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf?
			I do not understand, sir.
			Controls are not responding...
			Sir -- command functions are being
			rerouted.
			For what reason?
			Unknown, sir.
			Computer, route all command
			functions to the Bridge.
			Command functions are off-line.
			Reinitialize them on my
			authorization.
			Authorization denied.
			Explain.
			Picard command codes are no longer
			valid.
			What's happened? Who's
			transferred the voice
			authorization?
			I have.
			I'm afraid I had no choice but to
			take control of your vessel.
			If you harm me, sir, I would not
			be able to relinquish voice
			control of your vessel...
			Professor -- you've put us in a
			very dangerous situation.
			Those two planets will collide in
			less than five hours and explode
			to form a new star. If we don't
			have navigational control we won't
			be able to maintain a safe
			distance -- and this vessel will
			be destroyed.
			I'm just a fictional character...
			I haven't much to lose.
			Everything you've done to this
			point suggests that you want to
			live as much as we do.
			Not alone. Not without the
			Countess.
			We're studying ways to bring her
			off the Holodeck safely. But five
			hours is not enough time.
			I'm not so sure. A deadline has
			a wonderful way of concentrating
			the mind.
			Mister Data... investigate the
			possibility of doing what
			Professor Moriarty has asked.
			In the meantime, there are a few
			things we have to discuss.
			I can't think of anything else.
			We've taken the Holodeck apart
			circuit by circuit. There's
			nothing there that could account
			for Moriarty's ability to exist
			outside the grid.
			So how are we supposed to do the
			same thing for the Countess?
			I believe we are being asked to
			develop an entirely new science.
			Yeah... in less than five hours.
			Piece of cake.
			Perhaps we should consider the
			Transporter system. It uses many
			of the same principles as the
			Holodeck.
			Both, for example, are capable of
			converting energy into matter.
			Except the Transporter
			reconstitutes energy into
			permanent form; Holodeck matter
			doesn't have any cohesion unless
			it's inside the grid.
			I wonder what would happen if we
			tried to beam a Holodeck object
			off the grid?
			Nothing would happen. A Holodeck
			object is just a simulation --
			there's nothing there to provide
			a pattern lock for the
			Transporter.
			However, if it were possible to
			lock onto the object... it might
			rematerialize with the molecular
			cohesion of conventional matter.
			That's a big "if"... the
			Transporter just isn't going to
			recognize simulated matter.
			Unless...
			... unless we could find a way to
			compensate for the phase variance.
			If we could modify the pattern
			enhancers, we just might do it.
			Professor Moriarty has agreed not
			to interfere with routine ship
			operations. As long as he feels
			we're acting in good faith, we
			aren't in any immediate danger.
			Any progress?
			We're talking about using the
			Transporter to beam the Countess
			off the Holodeck... But I don't
			quite see how it's going to work.
			Keep at it -- I need to be able to
			tell him that we're making
			progress. Mister La Forge...
			Do you have any idea how Moriarty
			was able to take control of the
			ship?
			Somehow he managed to override the
			security lockouts and rewrite
			them. The guy's brilliant, in any
			century.
			I want you to find a way to undo
			whatever he's done... so we can
			regain control of the ship.
			Set up the pattern enhancers
			around whatever object you wish to
			transport. I will proceed to the
			Transporter Room to begin
			modifications.
			Computer, Sherlock Holmes Program
			Three-A.
			That program is already in use.
			Are you here to see Mister Holmes?
			Or perhaps Professor Moriarty?
			Neither is in just now.
			Oh, no... no. I'm not here to see
			anyone. I'm just --
			-- delivering these.
			Fine. Just put them anywhere.
			Actually... we have to put them
			right here...
			How curious... why is that?
			Well... it has to do with...
			It's nothing you have to worry
			about, Countess.
			Are you suggesting that it's
			beyond my comprehension?
			Oh, no... not at all. It's very
			simple, really. I need to enhance
			the molecular pattern of the
			chair... so the Transporter can
			get a better lock on the signal.
			This has to do with getting James
			and me into the real world.
			You... you know about that? You
			understand about -- the real
			world?
			James has explained it to me. It
			sounds like a grand adventure...
			there's nothing I love more than
			exploring the unknown. Have you
			ever been to Africa, Mister -- ?
			Ah -- Barclay. Lieutenant Reg
			Barclay. No, I never have.
			I have, when I was seventeen -- I
			went on safari with my uncle.
			My mother took to her bed in
			terror that I'd be bitten by a
			Tsetse fly... but I had a
			marvelous time.
			I got to wear trousers... the
			whole time.
			It was hard to go back to a
			corset, let me tell you.
			I... I'm sure it was.
			After that, I never stopped
			travelling. I couldn't bear to be
			stuck in one place for very long.
			So you can see I am looking
			forward to this new experience.
			Travelling the stars -- oh, my!
			You... know about that? Where we
			are? Countess... forgive me...
			but you don't sound like a
			Holodeck character.
			That's because she isn't.
			James!
			If you loved a woman like this,
			Lieutenant... would you be content
			to let her remain a simulation?
			You... you gave her consciousness?
			Yes... just as it was given to me.
			I'm not so sure that was a good
			idea...
			Nonsense. It was the only thing
			to do.
			Did you try taking her off the
			Holodeck?
			No. I am unwilling to risk the
			Countess' safety. I want to make
			sure nothing will happen to her.
			We may be closer to freedom than
			you think, James.
			These are devices which will
			enhance our molecular patterns...
			they'll help take us into the real
			world.
			Please proceed.
			We're going to try transporting
			this chair, first. We don't want
			to try it on the Countess until
			we're sure it will work.
			How thoughtful. Isn't he
			thoughtful, James?
			Barclay to Commander Data...
			Go ahead, Lieutenant.
			I'm ready here.
			The modifications are complete.
			Stand by.
			Standing by...
			Activate pattern enhancers.
			Energizing...
			I am having difficulty
			establishing a pattern lock...
			Boost the confinement beam.
			Pattern lock established...
			Bravo!
			Do you have the chair, Commander?
			No. It lost its cohesion as soon
			as the Transporter cycle was
			complete.
			It was a long shot to begin with.
			Agreed. However, we may be able
			to learn something from the
			attempt.
			Computer, display transport logs
			for the sequence just completed.
			Computer, what is being displayed
			here?
			Transport log seven-five-nine.
			That is the correct log... but no
			information is being presented.
			That's impossible.
			It is as if our attempt to
			transport the chair... never
			occurred.
			You wanted to see me?
			Yes, Captain... I think I may have
			found a way to reinstate your
			voice authorization. Give it a
			try.
			Computer, route all command
			functions to this location.
			Command functions are off-line.
			Reinitialize them on my
			authorization.
			Please input command codes.
			Picard Epsilon-seven-nine-three.
			Command codes verified.
			That should do it.
			Wait a minute... it didn't work.
			The computer didn't release the
			command pathways...
			Geordi.
			What did you do that for?
			Captain, I have determined how
			Moriarty was able to leave the
			Holodeck. He never did. Neither
			did we.
			None of this is real. It is a
			simulation. We are still on the
			Holodeck.
			We're still on the Holodeck... ?
			How do you know that?
			Through deduction. Lieutenant
			Barclay and I tried to transport
			a simulated object off the
			Holodeck -- something that has
			never been attempted. But since
			the transporter itself was just a
			simulation, the computer had no
			real data from which to create a
			transport log.
			It could just be a problem with
			the Transporter...
			But then I saw you working the
			PADD with your left hand.
			Commander La Forge is right-handed.
			A similar malfunction
			occurred in the Sherlock Holmes
			program I was running before
			Moriarty first appeared.
			Data, if what you're saying is
			true... then this is not Geordi La
			Forge. Are you certain?
			Computer, discontinue program.
			Computer, exit.
			It appears that Moriarty has
			programmed the Holodeck to accept
			only his commands.
			Picard to Bridge.
			Riker, here.
			What is my present location,
			Number One?
			Engineering...
			Is something wrong, sir?
			No. Thank you, Picard out.
			Our combadges must be locked into
			the simulation; if that had been
			the real Commander Riker, he would
			have given our location as
			Holodeck Three.
			Mister La Forge, will you excuse
			us please?
			Data... who is real here?
			You and I are real, as is
			Lieutenant Barclay. We entered
			the Holodeck together when we
			first went to see Moriarty.
			Then... from that point on... we
			have been existing in a Holodeck
			simulation of the Enterprise --
			created by Moriarty.
			I believe that to be the case,
			sir.
			I just gave my command codes to
			the computer... thinking I was
			regaining control of the ship.
			You may have inadvertently given
			Professor Moriarty the means of
			gaining control of the real
			Enterprise.
			Since he has never actually left
			the Holodeck... he'll probably
			demand that Commander Riker find
			a way for him to do so.
			How long until the planetary
			collision?
			Less than three hours.
			As long as Moriarty has control of
			the ship -- we are vulnerable.
			Somehow, we have to find a way to
			give him what he wants.
			Where is Captain Picard? What
			have you done with Lieutenant
			Barclay and Commander Data?
			They're safe... for now.
			Release control of this ship.
			I'm afraid I can't do that.
			What do you want?
			I only want what you have the
			luxury of taking for granted:
			freedom. I want to leave this
			Holodeck.
			I think you know that's
			impossible.
			Your crewmates here in my
			little... ship in a bottle, seem
			a bit more optimistic.
			Oh?
			They attempted to use your
			Transporter device to remove a
			simulated object from the
			Holodeck.
			If they tried it, they must have
			thought they were on to something.
			Their attempt was futile because
			their Transporter was just a
			facsimile. I expect more from
			you.
			Just because our Transporter is
			real doesn't mean it's going to
			work.
			I sense a distressing lack of
			enthusiasm on your parts...
			Sir... warp core temperature is
			rising -- approaching critical
			levels...
			I have nothing to lose,
			Commander...
			Mister La Forge... start working
			on the problem.
			Core temperature is dropping...
			Computer, resume program.
			Hello... have we met?
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			James has told me all about you.
			I am Regina, Countess Barthalomew.
			May I offer you tea, Captain?
			No, thank you.
			I've come to prevail upon your
			intelligence and insight.
			But not, apparently, my humility.
			Credit where it is due, Madame.
			You are clearly a woman not only
			of breeding, but of wit and
			sagacity.
			And you, sir, are a man of
			charm... and guile.
			You remind me of the Viscount
			Bisimuth... he could bewitch any
			woman who breathed...
			And do you suspect that is my
			intent?
			I cannot be certain of your
			intent... but I am certain that
			you are the kind of man who
			usually gets exactly what he
			wants.
			What does a woman like you see in
			a man like Professor Moriarty?
			He is an exciting man, Captain.
			Brilliant... incisive... ruthless.
			He has an almost irresistible
			appeal.
			He is also an arch criminal.
			Only because he was written that
			way.
			I see him much differently,
			Captain -- he is not a villain.
			Then it is your desire to leave
			the Holodeck in order to be with
			him.
			More than anything. Can you help
			us?
			I can. We've learned that if we
			uncouple the Transporter's
			Heisenberg Compensators and allow
			them to rescramble randomly, we
			can beam a Holodeck object... or
			a person... off the grid -- with
			all the cohesion of conventional
			matter.
			That's splendid! I must tell
			James.
			Wait... I came to you with this
			information because I believe you
			are someone who will listen to a
			reasonable proposition. Whose
			mind is open to compromise.
			Yes?
			My ship is in danger... it is
			imperative that I regain
			navigational control. You must
			convince Moriarty to return voice
			commands to me... or we will not
			modify the Transporter.
			I see.
			Once I have voice command, I
			promise we will transport you from
			the Holodeck.
			Forgive me, Captain... but that
			sounds a bit more like a threat
			than a compromise.
			Please understand -- I am
			responsible for the lives of over
			a thousand people.
			I'll do what I can.
			Any progress?
			I've got my people modifying the
			Transporter... but I don't see how
			running Holodeck matter through
			the pattern buffer will give it
			molecular cohesion.
			Any luck getting back systems
			control?
			Moriarty has reinitialized the
			Captain's command codes and input
			his own. We can't get control
			without them.
			Commander.
			The gravity well is beginning to
			intensify.
			Are we far enough away to keep
			from being pulled in?
			It's too soon to tell.
			Riker to Lieutenant Worf...
			Worf here, sir.
			How are you doing?
			There are force fields blocking
			our access to the Holodeck. It
			will take time to disable them.
			Keep trying.
			Aye, sir.
			Think, my dear. You're certain he
			said they had to uncouple the
			Heisenburg Compensators?
			Yes, James, I'm quite sure. But
			he won't do it unless you return
			control of the ship to him.
			I have them running around like
			rats in a maze.
			It's an entirely reasonable
			request. There are lives at stake --
			Yes, ours.
			What harm would there be in
			accepting his proposition?
			My dear, you are as brilliant as
			you are beautiful. Nonetheless,
			there are things you do not
			understand. You must let me
			handle this.
			Computer, arch.
			Commander Riker... a pleasure as
			always.
			I don't have time for games,
			Moriarty. This ship is falling
			into a gravity well. It'll be
			destroyed within twenty-five
			minutes... Holodeck and all.
			Then I'm sure you'll be motivated
			to listen to me... very, very
			carefully. I want to talk to you
			about uncoupling the Heisenburg
			Compensators.
			James? Where will we go when we
			leave here?
			Everywhere, my darling. There are
			more worlds in the heavens than
			there are grains of sand on a
			shoreline.
			I wish I could take my books.
			I'll be lost without them.
			I'll get you more. I promise
			you... you'll want for nothing.
			Riker to Moriarty.
			It's time...
			Yes, Commander?
			We're ready.
			As are we.
			Step inside the transport area and
			activate the pattern enhancers.
			We're ready here.
			Stand by... Energizing...
			Welcome aboard...
			May I present Regina, Countess
			Barthalomew...
			Countess...
			Forgive me if I skip the
			pleasantries... but given the
			circumstances...
			Ah, yes. I expect you want me to
			relinquish my hold on your vessel?
			Please.
			I'm afraid that won't be possible
			just yet.
			What --
			I have a small favor to ask of
			you.
			We had an agreement.
			And I intend to honor it. I have
			no wish to see your vessel
			destroyed. Just give me one of
			your...
			-- shuttlecraft, and allow us to
			leave in peace.
			There's no time for this. Release
			the command codes and we'll talk.
			I will not release your vessel...
			until I'm looking at it through a
			shuttlecraft window.
			Everything has been programmed to
			operate on voice command. Just
			tell the computer where you want
			to go.
			Excellent.
			You do have a destination? The
			shuttle's range is limited.
			Your concern for our welfare is
			touching.
			I suggest you head for Meles Two.
			It's the nearest inhabited planet,
			and the people are friendly.
			Where you go from there is your
			business.
			Please tell your Captain I'm sorry
			I couldn't say goodbye.
			I do wish I could see his face
			when he realizes where he's been
			the last several hours.
			Every second we waste puts us in
			that much more danger.
			Don't worry, you'll soon have
			control of your ship.
			Goodbye, Commander. Thank you for
			everything.
			Computer... prepare to depart.
			Open shuttlebay doors.
			It's so beautiful...
			Indeed, my dear. It is a wondrous
			sight. The first of many we are
			sure to encounter in our travels.
			Computer... interface with the
			central computer on the
			Enterprise.
			Interface complete.
			Release command function
			lockouts... authorization
			Moriarty, alpha two-four-one-five-nine.
			James... ?
			Yes, my love?
			Can we go back to Earth...
			someday?
			Of course, my dear... Of course.
			Computer...
			Store program Picard delta one in
			active memory and discontinue
			simulation.
			Program stored.
			It worked... they believed they
			were off the Holodeck.
			Did Moriarty release the voice
			commands, Captain?
			We'll soon find out. Computer...
			discontinue the Holodeck
			simulation created by Professor
			Moriarty.
			So far, so good. This should be
			the Holodeck on the real
			Enterprise.
			Picard to Bridge.
			Captain! Are you all right?
			Yes, Number One. What is your
			status?
			We regained full control of the
			ship a few minutes ago.
			And the planetary collision?
			Six minutes away... we're pulling
			back to a safe distance.
			We'll join you shortly.
			Captain --
			We're all right, Mister Worf.
			How did you do it, sir?
			We were able to program the
			Holodeck inside the Holodeck, and
			use the same ruse on Moriarty that
			he used on us.
			When he attempted to contact the
			real Bridge, he was in fact
			talking to a simulation.
			You mean he never realized that he
			hadn't left the Holodeck?
			The simulation is continuing even
			now, inside that cube.
			A miniature Holodeck?
			In a way, Doctor. However, it has
			no physicality. The program is
			continuing... but only within the
			computer circuitry.
			As far as Moriarty and the
			Countess know, they're half way to
			Meles Two by now.
			This enhancement module contains
			enough active memory to provide
			them with a lifetime of
			experiences.
			They'll live out their lives...
			and never know the difference.
			So in a sense... you did give
			Moriarty what he wanted.
			In a sense. And... who knows --
			our reality might not be all that
			different from theirs. All
			this...
			... might be nothing more than an
			elaborate simulation being run
			inside a little device... sitting
			on someone else's table...
			Well... I believe we have a new
			born star to study.
			Mister Barclay... you'll see that
			is kept in a safe place?
			Aye, sir.
			Computer... end program.
