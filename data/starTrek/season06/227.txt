			I have long been interested in
			the notion of time travel. In
			fact, I wrote a book about it...
			It chronicled the tale of a man
			from our era who fouled the sixth
			century by introducing newfangled
			gadgets and weapons... all in the
			name of Progress.
			The idea of time travelers isn't
			so far fetched as it seems...
			in fact, I have learned that, even
			now, people from the future are
			right here in San Francisco...
			and I have no doubt that they are
			intent on fouling our world...
			just like my Yankee did in King
			Arthur's time.
			Well. Let me serve notice: as
			soon as I get the necessary
			evidence, I intend to expose
			them... and make it absolutely
			clear that they are not welcome
			here.
			Yes, sir. And will this be a
			sequel to "Connecticut Yankee,"
			Mister Twain?
			The name's Clemens, son. Sam
			Clemens, with an "e."
			With an "e"... got it.
			'Scuse me.
			The coroner said this room
			contained all the cholera
			victims...
			It doesn't make sense that so many
			people are dying of cholera --
			it just isn't that virulent.
			Wil... this is strange...
			What is it?
			The cerebral cortex... the
			cerebellum... the brain stem...
			the entire nervous system -- has
			been drained of electrochemical
			energy.
			Here's another one... same neural
			depletion...
			These people didn't die of cholera
			-- they died because their neural
			energy was drained somehow.
			Drained... and taken to Devidia
			Two... for those aliens to
			ingest.
			If you were a time-traveller with
			a taste for human neural energy...
			how would you get your supply?
			I'd travel back to times when
			there were plagues and
			epidemics... when I could murder
			-- and use disease as a cover.
			Over half the victims who'd been
			drained of neural energy came from
			a place called Sisters of Hope
			Infirmary.
			It's a charity hospital near the
			waterfront.
			If the aliens have been killing
			people there, someone might have
			noticed something unusual...
			If they're moving among humans,
			they must have taken human form.
			The question is, how do we know
			who we're looking for... ?
			The tricorder picked up evidence
			of triolic activity in most of
			the bodies we looked at. If the
			aliens are leaving that signature
			behind, they'll be detectable.
			We might even be able to set
			up some kind of alien alarm
			system.
			Any luck contacting Data?
			None. The tricorder is
			broadcasting random emissions...
			but the range is pretty limited.
			Almost anything could interfere...
			She's back.
			Mister Picard!
			Coming, Mrs. Carmichael...
			Mister Picard... I'd be remindin'
			you that it's one o'clock.
			Yes... ?
			One o'clock of a Thursday.
			I'm sure I made it clear to you
			that the rent is always due,
			payable in full, by one o'clock
			on Wednesdays.
			Ah. The... rent.
			Mrs. Carmichael, my troupe is even
			now in rehearsals for a new
			production.
			Oh? I haven't heard of any new
			production. What play is it?
			It's -- "A Midsummer Night's
			Dream."
			We've performed in London...
			Paris... Milan... all to sold
			out houses. I assure you, we'll
			be able to pay the rent... with
			a bonus.
			No, no, no... I've heard you
			silver-tongued devils before...
			I'll have the rent in full...
			tomorrow... by one o'clock -- or
			you'll be performing on the
			street.
			I wouldn't do this for just
			anybody, Mister Clemens. And I
			hope you won't spread it around
			that I let you in...
			Of course not, Jack. And I assure
			you -- Mister Data would be most
			upset if you didn't.
			If I don't find that Letter of
			Intent he left for me... our major
			investor is going to pull out and
			take his business elsewhere.
			It has to do with Mister Data's
			engine, doesn't it?
			Engine...
			Yes... yes... this is exactly what
			it's all about...
			Mister Clemens... I'm gonna do
			you another favor today...
			Mmmmmm...
			You're always looking for good
			stories, right?
			Well, I've got a humdinger.
			Uh-huh...
			The story of -- my life. Now,
			I know you might think I'm
			young... but I've covered a lot
			of ground, and if I do say so,
			it'd make for some pretty
			fascinating reading.
			So. What do you think?
			About what?
			About writing my life story. You
			and me -- literary partners.
			You know, son, there's a maxim
			I've always lived by: no one's
			more qualified to write your story
			than you are.
			Me? Be a writer? You think I
			could?
			Long as you write what you know...
			you got any passions, son? Any
			dreams?
			I'd like to do some travelling...
			maybe go to sea... and Alaska.
			I've always had a notion to see
			Alaska.
			That's a great idea. If I were
			your age, that's exactly what I'd
			do... Alaska -- the Klondike...
			the Aurora Borealis... that's it,
			follow your dreams. And write
			about them.
			Thank you! Thank you, Mister
			Clemens. That's just what I'm
			going to do!
			You do that, son --
			You'll be seeing my name in print.
			London... the name's London.
			I'm sure I will. Good-bye now.
			... so when I finally got to the
			Head Surveyor... I found the
			location of your cavern. But
			you won't be able to get to it.
			Why is that?
			The only entrance is a mine
			shaft... right in the middle of
			the Presidio... the Army Fort.
			Perhaps you could arrange for us
			to get in.
			What?
			With permission to dig for the
			mine shaft.
			Data... so far I've been able to
			do everything you asked me to.
			But do you really expect me to
			get you into a high-security
			military installation?
			I have full confidence in your
			persuasive abilities.
			Well... this is more interesting
			than giving tea dances.
			That is strange...
			What?
			I left this device activated...
			but the transceiver assembly has
			been removed... without it I will
			be unable to track the time
			shifts.
			Clemens.
			Samuel Clemens?
			He's been driving me crazy. He
			watches the house, follows me down
			the street asking questions --
			I'd bet you anything he got in
			here and took your -- whatever
			you said.
			If you are correct, he must be
			told that the device has been
			modified in such a way that
			prolonged contact with human
			tissue would be highly toxic.
			Madame Guinan... Mister Data...
			good day.
			Mister Clemens... shame on you.
			Shame, madame? I think not. I
			find no shame in my efforts to
			uncover your plot.
			I keep telling you, there is no
			plot --
			Yes... you do keep telling me
			that.
			Mister Data, did you know that
			Madame Guinan here is from a
			renowned Boston family... a close
			relative of Judge Truman Williams?
			I believe that's what you said...
			Yes.
			Then... I wonder... why the Judge
			says he's never heard of you?
			That's what his telegram to me
			indicated...
			There's been a blood feud between
			two branches of the family. He
			doesn't acknowledge me.
			Ah. That must wound you deeply.
			What an interesting pair you
			are... an Ashanti princess...
			and a Swiss. Where in Switzerland
			are you from, Mister Data?
			I am French, not Swiss.
			Of course, that's right... now
			I remember. A Frenchman with
			a talent for poker, from what I
			hear.
			You know, I was talking with a
			friend of mine, Ches Whitley...
			he said to say hello... wonders
			when you're coming back.
			I do not believe I know Mister
			Whitley.
			No? He works at the County
			Assayer's Office... said you've
			been in there several times...
			claiming to be a geological
			engineer. Wanting information
			about mining operations during
			the 1850's...
			Remember him now?
			I do not know the gentleman by
			name. I have spoken to several
			people in that office.
			Yes... I know. And in the Hall
			of Records... and the Geological
			Society... and a little-known
			mineral shop in Chinatown. You
			do get around, don't you?
			As apparently you do, Mister
			Clemens.
			I must admit -- you've got me
			mystified.
			This contraption, for instance.
			Very unusual. It looks quite --
			futuristic. Tell me -- might
			it have something to do with
			"time shifts"?
			In a sense. The time shift is
			a new gearing system that I have
			invented... for a horseless
			carriage.
			Do not insult me.
			You've come to this century and
			brought your infernal technology
			with you... for God only knows
			what purpose... but I have no
			doubt that it will be the people
			of this century who will suffer
			for it.
			Mister Clemens, I think we've had
			quite enough of this. Mister
			Data's business is his own, and
			I'd thank you to leave.
			Pardon me, Madame, but it is
			my business... it is the business
			of all humanity, I believe, to
			stop both of you from whatever
			it is you are doing here. And
			that is what I intend to do.
			He won't last the day.
			Aren't we going to treat him?
			I wish we could. But at this
			point there's nothing to be done.
			Unless you know of some miracle
			treatment.
			Why don't we try an alkaline
			saline solution... to counteract
			dehydration?
			Nurse, if that were helpful,
			don't you think I would have
			ordered it?
			Now, you finish the charts and
			leave the practice of medicine
			to me.
			Yes, Doctor.
			... did your friend have any
			visitors before he died?
			No... had no family... only people
			to come were doctor and nurse.
			Very bad doctor.
			Only spent time with one man.
			I ask for water... he ignore me.
			Others cry in pain... doctor does
			not care.
			Very bad.
			Hello, Officer. This the
			Infirmary?
			Yes. The entrance is right there.
			Just what is it you're doing with
			those lamps?
			Replacing the wick screws. City
			ordinance... makes it safer in
			case of an earthquake.
			There hasn't been an earthquake
			here in thirty years.
			That's it for this ward. Have
			to be moving on.
			Earthquakes...
			Nurse, if you can handle things
			here, I have a meeting with the
			Board of Patrons.
			I'm sure I'll manage.
			There... by that bed. I can see
			an afterimage of triolic waves.
			They were here recently... within
			the last twenty-four hours.
			That's the bed where someone died
			last night...
			This man was complaining about
			a strange doctor and nurse who
			visited that patient.
			They might still be in the
			hospital.
			This will make you more
			comfortable...
			Do you need any help, Doctor?
			Doctor Apollinaire felt he had
			entered the algid stage... he was
			cyanotic, pulse unobservable...
			That's an interesting cane...
			Hold it!
			What's all this? What's going
			on here?
			Apparently a distraught
			relative... she became quite
			upset... we tried to calm her but
			she ran out.
			I heard an explosion...
			How about it? You people see any
			explosion?
			There was nothing like that,
			Officer...
			Okay, folks, I suggest you all
			clear out and let the patients
			have a little peace... sorry,
			Doctor.
			People said there was gunfire in
			here... What's going on?
			Just a misunderstanding... I'm
			clearing these people out of here.
			I've never seen you before...
			Just got assigned this morning.
			Usually work downtown.
			I worked downtown for three
			years... I don't remember you.
			Hold it!
			I'm going to ask all of you to
			come down to the station for
			questioning.
			Including you. Let's go...
			Where'd you get that? That's a
			gentleman's cane.
			Never saw a cane like this before.
			I'll have to confiscate it.
			Evidence.
			I want you to know... I have only
			the greatest respect for the law.
			Data!
			Boy, am I glad to see you!
			I would suggest we postpone our
			greetings for another occasion.
			Agreed. Let's get out of here.
			If we tune a phaser to the
			approximate frequency of triolic
			waves, and lay down a field
			burst... it might respond.
			The ophidian the aliens were
			carrying...
			What the...
			Minute space-time distortions...
			like the one we saw on Devidia
			Two...
			But they were so small... and
			they only lasted a second...
			The aliens seem to have the
			ability to concentrate the
			distortion -- and direct it toward
			a specific time and destination.
			Maybe they have something... a
			-- mechanism, that focuses it.
			Any device like that would produce
			significant levels of triolic
			waves...
			... like the ones in the cavern
			where Data's head was found.
			I have located that cavern --
			Mister Picard!
			I know you're in there! Open the
			door!
			Mrs. Carmichael... thank goodness
			you're here.
			How now, spirit! whither wander
			you?
			Over hill, over dale, Through
			bush, through brier, Over park,
			over pale...
			Ah -- just in time! We need
			someone to read a part...
			Mister Picard, I need to be
			talkin' to you...
			Ill met by moonlight, proud
			Titania.
			Now, Mrs. Carmichael...
			Right there...
			Ill met by moonlight, proud
			Titania.
			What, jealous Oberon. Fairies
			skip hence. I have foresworn his
			bed and company.
			Well, I don't need to hear any
			more. That was -- truly unique.
			Really?
			I think we've found our Titania...
			... don't you agree?
			Well... I did do a church play
			when I was a lass...
			You see? We'll begin rehearsals
			tomorrow.
			What theatre did you say?
			There you are! I have good news
			-- we can get into the Presidio
			--
			It is all right.
			General Mallory is usually a
			stickler for the rules... but I
			happen to know that his wife
			thinks she's a singer. So I told
			him she simply must perform at
			my next gathering... and the rules
			just... disappeared.
			You know me...
			Very well.
			Do I know you?
			Not yet. But you will.
			Thanks for your help, Officer.
			Make sure you put in the part
			about me spotting that phony
			policeman.
			Yessir, I will.
			H'lo, son...
			Mister Clemens... what brings you
			here?
			A writer's curiosity...
			I heard two people vanished into
			thin air in this Infirmary.
			One of the patients said that,
			yessir. But the police deny it.
			I'll bet they do...
			They say a band of outlaws set
			off an explosion in the
			hospital... then escaped.
			What did these outlaws look like?
			The carriage they escaped in was
			driven by an albino...
			Ah. Mister Data.
			You know him?
			You bet I do. You say there
			were others with him?
			Yes -- at least a dozen.
			His accomplices... they've come
			from the future -- my God, it's
			an invasion.
			An invasion... from the future?
			Mister Clemens... what can you
			tell me about this? Do you have
			any proof?
			Young man... when's your deadline?
			Five o'clock, sir.
			I'll meet you at your paper at
			four-thirty... with a story that
			will make your career.
			Thanks, Mister Clemens...
			Take me to the Presidio, driver.
			And don't spare the whip.
			The triolic levels are as high
			as they were on Devidia Two...
			... but no indication of any
			control mechanism.
			I'm not so sure.
			My VISOR is picking up crystalline
			fractures. These cavern walls
			have undergone some kind of
			selective molecular polarization.
			In fact, if I'm right... this
			whole cavern has been configured
			to focus the space-time
			distortion... just like a lens.
			Captain, we think we're on to
			something. The cavern itself
			seems to be acting as a focusing
			mechanism... and I'm betting the
			same is true of their habitat
			back on Devidia Two.
			If we can get back there... and
			destroy that site... can we put
			an end to their time
			traveling... ?
			We have the ophidian...
			But I don't know if it will work.
			The energy our phasers generate
			may not be entirely compatible
			with the ophidian.
			We have no choice but to try.
			An event I would most certainly
			enjoy witnessing...
			Move along... I suspect even
			time travellers are vulnerable
			to a Colt Forty-Five.
			Let's go -- I've made a young
			fellow a promise and I don't want
			to be late.
			Follow him!
			Is everybody all right?
			I think so...
			You--!
			Where are we -- and when is this?
			It's the twenty-fourth century...
			this is Devidia Two -- and you
			shouldn't be here.
			Seems to me I have as much right
			to be in your time as you had to
			be in mine. You see, sir, I
			wanted to see how you've conducted
			my future affairs.
			Your future affairs?
			The affairs of mankind.
			Don't you see -- the disappearance
			of Mark Twain... one of the most
			noted literary figures of the
			nineteenth century...
			Thank you...
			... that's not supposed to happen.
			I have only taken advantage of
			an irresistible occasion... as
			any good writer would.
			Bridge to Away Team...
			acknowledge.
			We're here, Mister Worf. How long
			have we been gone?
			You have been off sensor displays
			for almost nine days, sir.
			Stand by to transport five...
			Commander...
			Mister Worf... six to transport.
			Where are we... ?
			The Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			Chief, call security. We need
			an escort for this man.
			Security? What for?
			A werewolf...
			It's a long story, Mister Worf...
			I'll brief you later.
			Have Data's body brought to the
			Medical Lab. I'm going to try
			to re-attach the head we have.
			That head is almost five hundred
			years old...
			It's the best chance we've got.
			I want Mister Clemens here under
			escort at all times.
			Commander... perhaps I could
			handle that. I'd be happy to take
			Mister Clemens to quarters.
			Good idea.
			If you would accompany the
			Counselor...
			Madame... I'd be delighted.
			So this is a space ship, eh? Did
			you ever run into Halley's comet?
			Whoa... everything's spinning...
			Don't try to sit up too quickly...
			you've lost a lot of blood.
			Where'd... everybody go... ?
			I hope they're safely back on the
			Enterprise by now.
			You're still here...
			You were hurt. I had to make sure
			you were all right.
			You stayed here... for that... ?
			I can't very well let anything
			happen to you... you're far too
			important to me.
			You know... so much about me...
			Believe me, in the future the
			tables will be turned.
			We... become friends...
			It goes beyond friendship.
			But... I have to wait... almost
			five hundred years...
			And when we meet... I won't be
			able to tell you about this, will
			I?
			No. Because for me, it won't have
			happened yet.
			What happened... ?
			History fulfilling itself...
			History has to fulfill itself.
			Even Picard knew that.
			You were there, in the cavern.
			You know what happened. What
			am I supposed to do?
			Damn it, Guinan, don't play games
			with me... I need answers.
			If I tell you what happened in
			that cavern, it would affect any
			decision you're about to make.
			I can't do that. I won't do that.
			Not telling me might affect my
			decision, too... did you think
			of that?
			We're talking about Jean-Luc
			Picard. I'm not going to sit
			around and hope it all works
			out... I've got to do something...
			Any place that doesn't stock a
			good cigar doesn't rank high in
			my book.
			If you must have one, I'm sure
			we could replicate it for you.
			You think one of those --
			imitations -- could take the place
			of a hand-wrapped Havana?
			I wouldn't know...
			That's the problem I see here...
			all this technology... it only
			serves to take away life's simple
			pleasures. You don't even let
			a man open a door for a lady.
			I think what we've gained
			outweighs anything that might have
			been lost...
			Oh? I'm not so impressed with
			this future... huge starships...
			weapons that can no doubt destroy
			entire cities... military conquest
			as a way of life.
			Is that what you see here?
			Oh, I know what you say... this
			is a vessel of exploration... your
			mission is to, discover new
			worlds...
			Deck thirty-six.
			That's what the Spanish said...
			and the Dutch, and the Portuguese.
			It's what all conquerors say...
			I'm sure it's what you told that
			blue skinned fellow I just
			saw... before you brought him
			here to serve you.
			He's one of thousands of species
			we've encountered. We live in
			a peaceful Federation with many
			of them... the people you see are
			here by choice.
			So there are a privileged few...
			who serve on these ships, living
			in luxury, wanting for nothing.
			But what about everyone else?
			What about the poor? You ignore
			them...
			Poverty was eliminated a long time
			ago. And a lot of things
			disappeared with it:
			hopelessness... despair...
			cruelty... war...
			I come from a time when men
			achieve wealth and power by
			standing on the backs of the
			poor... when prejudice and
			intolerance are commonplace...
			when power is an end unto
			itself...
			And you're telling me... that
			isn't how it is anymore?
			That's right.
			Maybe it is worth giving up cigars
			for, after all...
			Tell me.... how long was it...
			before things began to change?
			A long time. The people of your
			lifetime won't see it.
			Is it working?
			Not so far. His restart units
			won't initialize.
			I thought his buffering program
			would have protected them... but
			I guess five hundred years was
			just too long a wait.
			My watch...
			It was found in the cavern... near
			Data's head.
			After five hundred years, I
			doubt that it'll work either.
			Mister Data... I fear I sadly
			misjudged you.
			As I have misjudged many things.
			Can you communicate?
			Yes...
			Are you injured?
			Why have you interfered?
			You hunt us... you kill us. We
			cannot allow that.
			We need your energy...
			Perhaps we could find a
			substitute...
			No... there is none... we must
			continue.
			We cannot allow that.
			We know how you move back and
			forth through time... my crew
			has returned to the twenty-fourth
			century to destroy your transport
			site on Devidia Two --
			Destroy it?
			Your weapons will only amplify
			the time distortion... you will
			annihilate your own world...
			I'm going back for the Captain...
			Mister Worf, prepare an Away Team
			to accompany me to the surface.
			Doctor, I need to know anything
			you can tell me about that
			ophidian.
			I've just started running some
			tests. If I could have a few
			hours...
			We can't give the aliens any
			more time...
			Wil, I haven't been able to
			determine if our phaser energy
			can generate a stable field.
			The risk would be --
			I accept the risk.
			Sir... permission to speak
			frankly?
			Go ahead.
			Our priority is to stop the aliens
			from making any more incursions
			to Earth. Any delay is
			unacceptable.
			If I can save Captain Picard, I
			consider it very acceptable.
			The Captain would not.
			I recommend we target photon
			torpedoes on the alien habitat
			and destroy it immediately.
			He's right, Wil.
			Mister Worf, power up the
			photons. Inform me when you're
			ready.
			Computer... calibrate the power
			flow polarity selector...
			Polarity selector is calibrated.
			Computer... initialize the
			re-load circuits.
			Re-load circuits are initializing.
			C'mon, Data... this ought to do
			it...
			Okay, Computer... deactivate the
			polarity selector.
			I don't get it... why isn't this
			working?
			Computer, run a diagnostic on the
			input polarizers.
			There is intermittent contact
			in the input polarizers.
			Intermittent?
			An iron filing... how did that
			get in there?
			Commander, I have set the photons
			to fire in staggered rounds,
			detonating in ten-second
			intervals.
			Very well. Fire when ready.
			The sequence will be ready to
			initiate in one minute.
			Computer, try another diagnostic
			on the input polarizers.
			Polarizer circuits are
			functioning.
			Then that should do it...
			Okay, Data... come on, now...
			...torpedoes... don't phasing...
			aliens...
			I am processing a binary message
			that was entered into my static
			memory by Captain Picard.
			Geordi, are we planning to fire
			on the alien habitat?
			Yeah, but --
			It is imperative that we do not.
			I will explain later.
			La Forge to Riker -- hold your
			fire!
			The binary message left by the
			Captain is not entirely clear.
			He seemed to be concerned about
			the phase differential of our
			photon torpedoes... that firing
			them might produce a catastrophic
			effect.
			Then how do we destroy their
			habitat?
			If I am correct... we must modify
			our weapons so that the force of
			the explosion is re-phased into
			the aliens' time continuum.
			If we outfit the photons with
			phase discriminators... we could
			get the necessary variance.
			How long will it take you?
			At least a couple of hours.
			Fine. That'll give me time to
			go get him.
			Sir?
			There's time now... I'm going
			back to the nineteenth century
			for the Captain.
			Doctor... ?
			My analysis of the phasers
			suggests you'd be able to open
			a rift... but it won't be stable
			enough to transport more than one
			person.
			You mean... if I go back... only
			one of us could return.
			That's right.
			Then I have the perfect solution
			for you.
			I'm the one who should return to
			the nineteenth century,
			Commander... and remain there
			so your Captain can return.
			There's a risk... we're not
			certain how stable the rift will
			be...
			There's risk in everything. The
			point is -- it's the right choice.
			I have more books to write... your
			Captain has a job to do here...
			Mister La Forge... brief him on
			what he'll need to do.
			I'm glad I have the chance to
			thank you.
			For what?
			For starting me on the greatest
			adventure a man's ever had. For

			I'm going to get help. We have
			to get you out of here...
			...wait... stay a while... maybe
			they'll come for you...
			No. You need help.
			This thing put me down in the

			forever to get here...
			Sir, Commander La Forge has
			completed the re-configuration
			of the photon torpedoes.
			If Clemens got back, the Captain
			should have been here by now.
			We have no way of knowing if
			Mister Clemens was successful.
			Re-establish your firing pattern,
			Mister Worf. We'll wait five more
			minutes.
			Yes, Commander.
			No time for chit-chat, sir...
			According to Mister La Forge --
			who did get your message by the
			way -- a frequency setting of
			point-oh-four-seven on your phaser
			will correctly activate this
			creature.
			You'll have to get help. Guinan
			needs medical attention...
			I promise you she will be attended
			to.
			We have a bill at Mrs.
			Carmichael's boarding house --
			It will be settled.
			Thank you.
			I wish time had allowed me to know
			you better...
			You'll just have to read my books.
			What I am is pretty much there.
			I'll see you in five hundred
			years, Picard.
			I'll see you... in a few minutes.
			Commander... I am picking up
			massive triolic wave activity on
			the surface.
			Is it the Captain?
			There are no human life signs.
			No sign of a temporal distortion?
			No, sir. But triolic activity
			is increasing.
			The aliens...
			Mister Worf, are the photons
			ready?
			Yes, sir.
			Fire.
			Torpedoes away, sir.
			Commander -- I am detecting a
			temporal distortion on the
			surface... and human life signs.
			O'Brien -- get him out of there!
			Transporter Room -- do you have
			him?
			He does indeed, Commander. And
			believe me... it's good to be
			back.
			We have destroyed the target, sir.
			There is no further indication
			of triolic activity.

			Mister Data has been restored to
			us, head and all... and Samuel
			Clemens will write the books he
			was to have written after our

			Be careful not to jostle her too

			Don't worry... you're going to
			be fine...
