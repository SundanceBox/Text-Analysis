			Computer... lights.
			Computer, turn on the lights.
			Good, you're awake.
			Who... are you?
			Please, Counselor, there is little
			time. The Commander will be
			calling for you at any moment.
			Where am I?
			You are aboard the Imperial
			Romulan Warbird Khazara. I am Sub-Commander
			N'Vek.
			Warbird?
			I was at the neuro-psychology
			seminar on Bokara-Six. The last
			thing I remember was returning to
			my quarters. I was...
			...attacked. I felt a...
			hypospray?
			It was necessary. I could not be
			certain you would come
			voluntarily.
			My head... is still spinning...
			There are drugs in your system,
			but they've nearly dissipated.
			The disorientation will pass.
			Why have you brought me here?
			Listen to me carefully.
			You are no longer Deanna Troi.
			You are Major Rakal of the Tal
			Shiar, the Imperial Intelligence.
			Commander Toreth will--
			Am I a prisoner?
			No. There is no time to explain
			everything. You must listen.
			Commander Toreth will want to know
			your mission. Tell her nothing.
			Simply instruct her to proceed to
			the Kaleb sector, course one-oh-two
			mark four.
			The Kaleb sector...
			Repeat it... heading one-oh-two
			mark four.
			Heading... one-oh-two mark four...
			She'll... take orders... from me?
			You are an officer of the Tal
			Shiar. She will obey you. But do
			not push her too far.
			Sub-Commander N'Vek. We are
			approaching the loading point.
			Bring our guest to the Bridge.
			Yes, Commander. Immediately.
			Please, we must hurry.
			I'm not going anywhere... tell me
			what this is about.
			You are a Starfleet officer
			disguised as a Romulan. Unless
			you trust me and do exactly as I
			have said... Toreth will discover
			you -- and you will be killed.
			How do I know I won't be killed
			anyway?
			Your only chance to get off this
			ship alive is to do as I say.
			You are an empath. You would know
			if I am lying. Am I?
			No.
			Then let us go see the Commander.
			Orbit established, Commander.
			You may commence loading the
			cargo. Notify me when the
			transfer is complete.
			Yes, sir.
			Sir, may I present Major Rakal of
			the Tal Shiar.
			This is Commander Toreth.
			Attend to your station.
			Why are you here without your
			guards?
			Well?
			The mission is one of utmost
			secrecy. I could not... risk...
			bringing guards.
			And exactly what is the nature of
			this clandestine assignment?
			I... cannot reveal that.
			Oh? Why not?
			I am under orders.
			You don't act like a member of the
			Tal Shiar. How long have you been
			with Intelligence?
			Several months.
			Ah.
			Commander, the cargo is on board
			and secured.
			Tell me... is there a reason why
			the Commander of the ship is being
			kept ignorant of its cargo?
			I don't know what you mean...
			I've been ordered to take on
			cargo... but its contents are
			unknown to me. Does that seem
			wise?
			I am responsible for the safety of
			this ship and its crew. How do I
			know this cargo is safe to
			transport?
			I'm sure it is safe. Otherwise it
			would not have been loaded.
			Ah. Because the Tal Shiar is so
			deeply concerned with the safety
			and well-being of the military...
			I'm sure every person on this
			Bridge could offer testimony about
			personal experiences with the Tal
			Shiar... and I doubt that many
			would recall those encounters as
			tender and caring...
			So you will forgive me, Major, if
			I am hesitant to accept your
			assurances that the cargo is no
			danger to my crew.
			I intend to open those containers --
			That cargo is the property of the
			Tal Shiar. You will not touch it.
			By whose authority?
			Mine. And if you do not wish to
			undergo another "personal
			experience" with the Tal Shiar, I
			suggest you not question me again.
			Commander Toreth... you will now
			proceed on course bearing one-oh-two
			mark four to the Kaleb sector.
			The Kaleb sector is virtually
			deserted. Why would we go there?
			Because those are your orders.
			Pilot, set course. Bearing one-oh-two
			mark four. Warp six.
			Yes, Commander.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46519.1.
			We have arrived at Research
			Station seventy-five to take on a
			rather unique passenger... one
			whose homecoming will undoubtedly
			be difficult.
			The man acted dishonorably. He is
			a traitor.
			He risked his life to get here.
			It took him two weeks alone in a
			scout ship.
			That does not excuse his original
			actions.
			Well, maybe he finally realized he
			made a mistake.
			It took him twenty years too long.
			Energize.
			Ensign DeSeve. By order of
			Starfleet Command, you are hereby
			placed under arrest for treason.
			I... understand.
			After Doctor Crusher certifies you
			medically fit, you will be
			confined to quarters until a
			formal courts martial can be
			convened.
			And get some civilian clothes. I
			don't want to see you in that
			uniform.
			Yes, sir.
			Commander -- I must speak with
			Captain Picard.
			The Captain is a busy man.
			Please... it's important. Urgent.
			I'll tell him.
			Vorcha'ak.
			There is no listing for Vorcha'ak.
			Coffee...
			Enter.
			Commander!
			At ease... and it's Captain,
			actually.
			I'm... sorry, sir.
			Captains, not Commanders... it's
			been so long since I've... I'll
			remember.
			You said it was important that I
			see you.
			Yes... Captain. I have a message.
			From Ambassador Spock.
			He said it involves further...
			"cowboy diplomacy." He said you
			would understand...
			There will be a Corvallen
			freighter arriving in the Kaleb
			sector in the next twelve hours.
			Spock wants you to rendezvous with
			that ship and take its cargo back
			to Federation space.
			What kind of cargo?
			He said it was...
			... "important to the future of the
			Romulans and the Federation."
			This is why you've returned... to
			bring this message?
			Partly.
			In order to know whether Spock's
			message is being delivered
			accurately... I need to
			understand the messenger.
			I was... ready to come back.
			Romulus had... lost its appeal.
			And yet you found something very
			appealing about it at one time.
			The Romulans are very... moral,
			Captain. They have an absolute
			certainty about what is right and
			what is wrong... who is a friend
			and who is an enemy. They have a
			strict moral compass which
			provides them with a clarity of
			purpose.
			I once found their sense of
			purpose, their commitment and
			passion, to be very compelling.
			But not any longer...
			As I've grown older, I realize
			that clarity of purpose is a more
			ambiguous matter than I had
			thought in my youth.
			Mister Riker. Set course for the
			Kaleb sector. Warp eight.
			Aye-aye, sir.
			You may wait outside. Make
			certain we are not disturbed.
			They're all terrified of me.
			The purpose of the Tal Shiar is to
			ensure loyalty. To defy them is
			to invite imprisonment... or
			death.
			It's time you told me what this is
			all about.
			That is why I called you here.
			This is one of the cargo
			containers we brought on board
			earlier.
			What's in it?
			He's alive... but in stasis. Who
			is it?
			Vice Proconsul M'ret of the
			Imperial Senate...
			... and his two top aides.
			M'ret... he's one of the highest
			ranking members of the Romulan
			government...
			His defection will be a profound
			blow to Romulus...
			Why is he doing this?
			M'ret had questioned the
			repressive activities of the
			government -- and was in danger of
			being imprisoned. He is willing
			to take this risk in order to
			protest Romulan policy and support
			the dissident movement.
			You are part of Ambassador Spock's
			underground movement...
			Yes. If we are able to deliver
			M'ret safely, Spock is hopeful
			that we can establish an escape
			route for the thousands of
			dissidents who live in fear of
			their lives.
			Now you realize why we are willing
			to go to such extraordinary
			lengths -- even kidnapping you --
			to make sure we succeed.
			You've given me the identity of a
			Tal Shiar officer... is there a
			real Major Rakal?
			There was. She was killed so that
			you could take her place. Only a
			member of the Tal Shiar would have
			the authority to alter a ship's
			mission.
			But -- why me? You could have
			found a Romulan to play this
			role...
			Yes -- for this part of the plan.
			But if anything goes wrong... we
			will need a Starfleet officer.
			Why?
			There's no need to go into that
			unless it becomes necessary.
			For your own sake, Counselor --
			the less you know about the
			specifics of this plan, the
			better.
			What is your plan?
			When we reach the Kaleb sector, we
			will rendezvous with a Corvallen
			freighter. You will take these
			containers onto their ship and
			accompany them back to Starfleet
			Headquarters.
			The Corvallens are mercenaries...
			Do they know what's in these
			containers?
			No. They were hired simply to
			take you to Federation space.
			Very well.
			We are due in the Ward Room
			shortly. The senior officers
			always dine together.
			I'll go to my quarters. I think
			it would be best if I stayed away
			from the Commander.
			No, you will be expected to
			attend. I'll go ahead... follow
			me after a few moments. Commander
			Toreth must not feel that anything
			is unusual.
			... and we had been told that the
			Klingon outpost was undefended.
			So when their warships decloaked,
			they took us completely by
			surprise...
			... The Klingons destroyed half my
			squadron before we could even
			return fire. But when we did...
			they were no match for us. I
			destroyed their flagship myself.
			I received the Sotarek Citation
			for my actions that day.
			The Intelligence Officer in charge
			of the mission was executed.
			Major. Welcome to our table.
			Commander.
			I suggest you try the viinerine.
			It's quite good.
			I realize it's nothing compared to
			what you're accustomed to on
			Romulus... but you could at least
			try the viinerine...
			I've smelled better viinerine on
			prison ships.
			No doubt.
			Tell me, Major... did you train at
			the Intelligence Academy or the
			Imperial War College?
			The Academy.
			Ah -- then you know Commander
			Konsab.
			I know of him.
			I assume you studied Military
			History with him?
			Yes.
			I was wondering what you felt
			about his theory on the
			differences between the military
			and the Tal Shiar?
			Which aspects are you referring
			to?
			Are you sure you attended class
			regularly, Major? This was one of
			Konsab's main themes.
			Do you have a point to make,
			Commander? If so, it has escaped
			me.
			Commander Konsab believes that, in
			order to function, military
			officers have to trust each other.
			Members of the Tal Shiar, on the
			other hand, trust no one. They
			expect deception, so they always
			find it.
			You've made your opinion of the
			Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander.
			I hope so.
			We ensure the loyalty of the
			people. Do you believe the Empire
			would be better off without our
			protection?
			Protection? From whom? Was the
			Empire threatened by the words of
			an old man, a devoted citizen who
			merely tried to speak his mind?
			How did the Tal Shiar protect the
			Empire by dragging my father from
			our home in the middle of the
			night?
			Clearly, your father was a
			traitor.
			No. He was just an idealistic old
			man... and I never saw him again.
			I don't need your devotion,
			Commander. Just your obedience.
			That is all you have.
			Commander. Sensors are picking up
			an unidentified ship on an
			intercept course.
			What is the configuration?
			It appears to be a freighter,
			Commander.
			Hail them.
			Visual.
			Commander. We are glad to see
			you. We are prepared to transfer
			your cargo as agreed...
			With whom do you have this
			"agreement"?
			Our arrangements were made with
			Major Rakal. You may rest assured
			that your cargo will be taken
			safely to its destination.
			We will transmit coordinates for
			you to beam it aboard.
			He's lying. They have no
			intention of keeping their word.
			Are you certain?
			Why did you destroy that vessel?
			I beg forgiveness, Commander,
			but... Major Takal ordered me to
			fire.
			The Corvallen freighter has been
			completely destroyed, Commander.
			There are no survivors.
			I demand an explanation.
			How many were aboard that ship?
			Approximately eighteen people,
			sir.
			I don't care if there were
			eighteen or eight-hundred.
			On this ship, I give the command
			to fire, Major. You have no right--
			This gives me the right.
			Even you must eventually answer to
			someone. You will be held
			accountable.
			I have been given broad
			discretionary powers. Sub-Commander
			N'Vek acted on my
			authority... the authority of the
			Tal Shiar. I assure you -- this
			action will not be questioned.
			I will nonetheless make a note in
			my log that I am not responsible
			for those eighteen lives... and
			that I deplore their loss.
			Do what you feel necessary. In
			the meantime, we must protect
			ourselves.
			Activate the cloaking device.
			Cloak is engaged.
			And what are my orders now, Major?
			Hold position -- and wait.
			There is no sign of the freighter,
			Sir. We are the only ship in the
			area.
			Ensign, verify our position.
			We're holding at the coordinates
			specified by Ensign DeSeve, sir.
			Is there anything on long range
			sensors?
			Sensors indicate no other ships
			within three light years.
			Has this all been a hoax?
			That's one possibility.
			Mister Worf, bring Ensign DeSeve
			to my Ready Room.
			Well, Mister DeSeve. You promised
			me a freighter with an important
			cargo. The only thing here is
			empty space. Do you have an
			explanation?
			I... don't understand...
			Sir, he has deceived us.
			No -- I was told the ship would be
			at these coordinates.
			You said the message came directly
			from Ambassador Spock?
			Yes.
			Well... not exactly...
			What does that mean?
			Someone else relayed the message
			to me. But he said Spock spoke
			directly to him.
			I trust the man who spoke to me.
			He would not have lied.
			Was he Romulan?
			Yes.
			He is a member of the underground --
			a dissident. He risks his life to
			work with those who want a
			different future for Romulus.
			Captain, he could be leading us
			into a trap.
			No, that's not so...
			It would be risky to set a trap
			here, so close to Federation
			space... but the fact remains --
			there is no freighter.
			Ensign DeSeve, did your contact
			tell you anything else that might
			be helpful?
			The freighter is an old Antaresclass
			vessel... it has limited
			range and speed.
			It couldn't have taken on its
			cargo more than a day ago... which
			means it has to be within fifteen
			light years of here.
			Why didn't you mention this
			earlier?
			It didn't seem necessary. And on
			Romulus, you learn not to
			volunteer information.
			It's a hard habit to break.
			Perhaps now would be a good time
			to start. Gentlemen, come with
			me.
			Mister Data, initiate a phase
			three search pattern -- radius
			fifteen light years.
			Aye, Captain.
			Ensign DeSeve, I want you to stay
			right here. In case you recall
			anything else that might have
			slipped your mind.
			Our plan has collapsed...
			Our plan? What about the people
			on that freighter? Why did you
			fire?
			There was no alternative. You
			told me they couldn't be trusted.
			If I let them live... the whole
			mission would be in jeopardy?
			Eighteen people lost their
			lives...
			Don't lecture me, Counselor. A
			number of people have died in
			order to carry out this mission.
			Believe me, those eighteen won't
			be the last.
			I'm sorry... but I can't dismiss
			those lives so easily.
			Fine. Agonize all you want... but
			don't let it get in the way of our
			plan.
			You don't have a plan anymore.
			You remember I told you if
			anything went wrong, we would need
			a Starfleet officer...
			Yes...
			There is a Starfleet base on
			Draken Four. It is two days away
			at maximum warp.
			That's where we're going.
			In a Romulan ship...
			Yes. It's your job to order
			Toreth to proceed into Federation
			territory.
			We'll never get through the
			gravitic sensor nets.
			We will... if you provide the
			correct access codes.
			Do you really think this has a
			chance of succeeding?
			If you have another idea, I'll be
			happy to consider it.
			You will plot a course for the
			Draken System.
			You can't be serious.
			Draken Four was the freighter's
			destination.
			I ordered it destroyed because I
			recognized the Captain -- a known
			Federation spy. Now, we must
			deliver the cargo ourselves.
			Why must --
			I do not intend to explain myself
			to you. Set a course.
			In order to reach Draken we will
			have to travel through Federation
			space for nearly twenty hours.
			That is not a problem.
			Contrary to the propaganda your
			superiors would have us believe,
			Starfleet is neither weak nor
			foolish. The chances of us
			reaching Draken undetected are not
			good.
			We will be cloaked.
			The cloaking device does not make
			us completely invulnerable. You
			would know that if you had spent
			any time in the field.
			The Federation has littered their
			borders with subspace listening
			posts and gravitic sensors. They
			may even have a tachyon detection
			grid in operation, in which case
			they will know we're there.
			If we are discovered within
			Federation territory, it could be
			interpreted as an act of war.
			The Tal Shiar has obtained access
			codes for the sensor nets. I will
			provide them if necessary.
			That is no guarantee that we will
			escape detection.
			Your cowardice does not befit a
			Romulan soldier.
			People blame the military for the
			wars we are asked to fight. But
			I think it is your kind, Major,
			that will be the death of us all.
			Plot a course for the Draken
			System.
			Course plotted, sir.
			Prepare for warp --
			Commander, sensors are picking up
			a vessel.
			Our cloaking device is still
			engaged... they have not detected
			us.
			Activate Viewscreen.
			It is the Enterprise, Commander.
			Well, Major... it appears your
			suspicions about that freighter
			were correct after all. The
			Federation has come in search of
			their spies.
			Status.
			They are scanning the debris of
			the freighter. Their shield
			levels are normal and their weapon
			systems are not active.
			They are not prepared for battle,
			sir.
			Then they were not expecting us to
			be here. And I see no reason to
			alter that perception.
			The radiation from the debris
			field could make our cloak
			detectable if we engage warp
			engines. Proceed at maneuvering
			speed --
			One moment, Commander.
			We should hold our position until
			the Enterprise has left the area.
			We cannot risk detection.
			Even if we are detected, they will
			not be able to track us once we go
			to warp.
			We haven't established their
			intentions.
			Their intentions are obvious...
			and of no concern to us, Major.
			Proceed on course, maneuvering
			engines only. Go to warp when
			we're clear of the debris field.
			Yes, Commander.
			We will clear the field in twenty-seven
			minutes.
			You will keep me informed of our
			progress.
			It is not wise to challenge the
			Tal Shiar, Commander.
			I will not let her tell me how to
			run my ship.
			The debris is widely scattered,
			sir. It appears to be the remains
			of a ship...
			... My analysis indicates that it
			was an Antares-class freighter.
			That's the ship we were supposed
			to meet...
			Could they have had some sort of
			malfunction... a reactor core
			breach?
			I do not believe so. That would
			not be consistent with the debris
			pattern. However, sensors do
			indicate extremely high levels of
			residual antiprotons.
			Romulan disruptor fire...
			That is correct. And based on the
			antiproton decay, I would estimate
			that the incident occurred within
			the last four-point-three hours.
			Then... the Romulans could still
			be in the vicinity.
			Red alert. Shields at maximum.
			Whatever cargo was on that
			freighter, the Romulans didn't
			want it to reach us. Are you sure
			you don't know what it was?
			No, sir. I swear it.
			All we seem to have here are
			questions.
			Mister Data, continue scanning the
			area.
			Somehow, we have to get a message
			to the Enterprise.
			That's impossible.
			This is the perfect opportunity.
			The Enterprise is nearby. If we
			can communicate with them, they
			might be able to help us.
			Counselor. This ship is
			travelling under cloak. All of
			our electromagnetic emissions are
			being monitored. If we attempted
			any communication whatsoever we
			would be discovered instantly. It
			could not succeed.
			We must continue to Draken Four.
			That is the safest course.
			Is there anything you can do to
			the ship or the cloaking device
			that would let the Enterprise
			track us?
			Track us? No -- we want to get
			into Federation territory
			undetected.
			What we want -- is to get the
			dissidents to safety. Now answer
			the question. Is there a way?
			If there were, I wouldn't do it.
			Yes, you will.
			Counselor --
			We're not playing it your way any
			more, N'Vek. I've been
			kidnapped... surgically
			altered... put in danger... I've
			gone along with all your plans.
			Now, you are going to listen to
			me. You figure out how to let the
			Enterprise track us, or I will go
			to Toreth and tell her I've
			discovered you're a traitor. I'll
			order you ejected into space. Do
			you understand me, Sub-Commander?
			There is one possibility. In
			order for a ship to remain
			undetectable while cloaked, the
			radiative emissions from the warp
			engines must be precisely
			balanced.
			The ship's Engineer is a
			sympathizer. He may be able to
			slightly misalign one of the
			nullifier cores. It would create
			a small magnetic disturbance in
			space whenever we were in motion.
			Good. Do it.
			The effect would occur only
			intermittently. They might not
			even detect it.
			If that's the best we can do, we
			have to try it.
			Anything more would register
			immediately on the Bridge.
			Even this slight misalignment
			might be detected.
			It's a risk we'll have to take.
			You're the one who outlined the
			stakes to me, N'Vek. Are you
			getting squeamish now, just
			because things are getting a
			little more dangerous?
			Captain. Sensors are picking up
			a polarized magnetic distortion to
			our port side...
			Analysis.
			The distortion is extremely weak,
			sir... It appears to be moving,
			slowly... it --
			It is gone, sir.
			Gone?
			The distortion no longer registers
			on our instruments.
			Mister Data, could this distortion
			be caused by a cloaked ship?
			Unknown. Our understanding of
			Romulan technology is still
			limited.
			Captain...
			Romulan ships use a forced quantum
			singularity as a power source. If
			that system is not functioning
			perfectly or is damaged, even
			slightly... it might show through
			the cloak as a magnetic
			disturbance of some kind...
			The distortion has reappeared...
			bearing three-three-seven mark
			ten...
			It has disappeared again, sir.
			Mister DeSeve, is it your opinion
			that we're picking up a cloaked
			Romulan ship?
			It's a strong possibility, sir.
			Mister Data, continue your scan.
			Helm, link navigational control to
			Mister Data's console. Plot an
			intercept course toward that
			distortion.
			Commander. The Enterprise is
			underway.
			Good. What is their course?
			They are heading toward us, sir.
			What?
			They appear to be on an intercept
			course.
			What is the status of our cloaking
			device? Is there a malfunction of
			any kind?
			The cloaking device is functioning
			correctly, sir. All shipboard
			emissions are within normal range.
			Commander. The Enterprise may
			simply be engaged in search
			operations.
			Perhaps.
			Where is it now, Mister Data... ?
			Dead ahead, sir. It is slowing--
			It has disappeared once again,
			sir.
			It may have been coming to a halt.
			Stop engines.
			If it is a Romulan ship, will they
			hold position until we leave?
			I don't think so, sir. A Romulan
			Commander's instinct would be to
			attack.
			Pilot. Engage maneuvering
			engines, forward zero-point-one.
			Take us directly under their hull.
			Yes, Commander.
			What are you doing?
			It seems the Enterprise may be
			able to track us even though we're
			cloaked.
			I intend to find out whether they
			can or cannot.
			N'Vek. Ready attack procedure.
			Sir, disruptors are standing by.
			Ready to disengage cloak.
			Commander, we cannot risk an
			engagement here.
			Considering the nature of our
			mission, I would have preferred to
			avoid it as well. But I see no
			other alternative.
			What do you intend to do?
			We will pass as close as we
			possibly can. If they do have the
			ability to track us, they will
			move to avoid a collision.
			And if they do... I will destroy
			them.
			Sir, the magnetic distortion has
			reappeared.
			Bearing and speed?
			It appears to be moving toward us,
			closing slowly at one-hundred
			kph... its bearing indicates a
			possible collision course.
			Time to impact?
			I am unable to make a precise
			measurement. However, I estimate
			impact within ninety seconds.
			This doesn't make any sense. Why
			would they be trying to hit us?
			And if they were, why not hit us
			at full speed?
			I don't know. The Romulans will
			sometimes make suicide attacks,
			but only as a last resort.
			There's no reason for it here.
			Time to impact, approximately
			sixty seconds.
			We don't have the luxury to
			speculate.
			Back us away from that distortion,
			Ensign. One-half impulse.
			Aye-aye, sir.
			They are moving away, Commander.
			Prepare attack sequence.
			All sections report ready for
			battle, Commander.
			Disruptors are fully charged.
			Disengage cloak on my command.
			Prepare to fire--
			Disregard that order.
			What?
			I do not authorize this attack.
			You will cease battle operations
			immediately.
			I do not need your authorization
			to attack, Major. This is my
			ship.
			How typical of the military to
			resort to brute force when
			discretion is required.
			The Enterprise has demonstrated
			that they can track us. They must
			be destroyed.
			That's correct -- they can track
			us.
			And if we attack them -- your way --
			they will return fire. But we
			will be vulnerable as we cloak and
			our shields drop. They will
			destroy us.
			Do you question my ability to
			command?
			You are not fit to command.
			Step down.
			Step down or I will have you
			removed.
			Do you think anyone here will
			listen to you?
			If any one of you defies the Tal
			Shiar, you will not bear the
			punishment alone. Your
			families... all of them, will be
			there beside you.
			I am now Commander of this ship.
			You will take orders from me and
			no one else.
			Remove Commander Toreth from her
			station. If she resists, shoot
			her.
			Commander... please... step down.
			Remove her weapon.
			Now, Commander... watch and learn.
			In order to defeat your enemy, you
			must first understand them. The
			Federation wishes to avoid war at
			all cost. So I shall offer them
			a diplomatic solution... get them
			to lower their shields... and then
			destroy them.
			Captain, we are being hailed.
			On-screen.
			I am Major Rakal of the Tal Shiar.
			I am Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise.
			How can we be of help?
			A Carvallen freighter was
			destroyed not far from here... we
			detected the residual effects of
			disruptor fire. Can you shed any
			light on this?
			A regrettable incident, Captain.
			The freighter was fired upon by
			the former Commander of this
			vessel. I have now taken control,
			and I assure you there will be no
			more attacks.
			Still, there was a significant
			loss of life...
			Captain... we do not want this
			incident to be exaggerated. You
			and I can discuss it calmly...
			diffuse it before it becomes
			inflated.
			Yes... I agree.
			I will come onto your ship.
			Please lower your shields and
			prepare to beam me aboard.
			Very well.
			Mister Worf, lock onto Major
			Rakal. Transport on my command.
			Aye, sir.
			Thank you, Captain.
			What's she doing on that ship?
			I don't know... but she needs our
			help to get back. Mister Worf,
			keep your lock on her no matter
			what happens.
			Yes, Captain.
			Lower the shields...
			They are dropping their shields.
			Activate forward disruptor array
			and fire when ready.
			Yes, Major.
			Firing...
			Captain, they have fired on us!
			Shields up... stand by phasers.
			Damage report.
			We sustained a direct hit... but
			there is negligible damage. The
			disruptor had almost no power.
			This is Proconsul M'ret... and his
			aides. They are part of the
			underground movement...
			They're in stasis...
			Medical team to the Bridge.
			Where's Deanna?
			Disruptors were ineffective... the
			Enterprise was not damaged. They
			have re-established full shields.
			I am reading a malfunction in our
			forward disruptor array... the
			power system has destabilized --
			You are lying to me. The
			disruptor beam was purposely
			sabotaged to conceal a transporter
			beam within it.
			Quickly... locate the transport
			coordinates.
			What have you done?
			The transporter beam originated
			in... our cargo bay. Something
			was transported from there -- to
			the Enterprise.
			So. The mysterious cargo...
			brought on board by Major Rakal of
			the Tal Shiar... has now been
			transported to a Starfleet vessel.
			It appears we have two traitors in
			our midst.
			Well, Major... now that you can no
			longer take refuge behind the
			shield of the Tal Shiar... it's
			time you answered a few questions.
			What was in those cargo
			containers?
			Not so sure of yourself now, are
			you? Well, no matter. We'll soon
			learn all we need to know.
			Then we will execute you.
			Drop shields and cloak the ship.
			Prepare to go to warp.
			Mister Worf -- now.
			Counselor -- are you all right?
			Yes...
			Let's get you to Sickbay...
			Ensign, get us out of here -- warp
			nine.
			Aye, sir.
			I think that does it. How does it
			feel to have your own face back?
			Just right. Thank you.
			The men you helped rescue are
			safe. Proconsul M'ret is deeply
			grateful for your help.
			The thanks should go to N'vek...
			He sacrificed himself to save
			them... and me...
			Thanks to the two of you, the way
			has been paved for other rescue
			operations.
			You can be sure that N'vek's
			efforts... and his sacrifice...
			were not in vain.
