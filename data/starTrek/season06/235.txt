			Commander... is it your intention
			to continue growing your beard?
			I'm not sure, Worf. Why?
			I am just asking.
			Seven-card stud, one-eyed jacks
			are wild. Frankly, I like your
			beard, Geordi.
			Thanks, Doctor.
			The king is high... your bet, Wil.
			Of course, I'm always a little
			suspicious of men with beards.
			For what reason?
			I don't know... it's as though
			they're trying to hide something.
			Hide -- ? Doctor, that's
			ridiculous. Beards are a proud
			and ancient tradition.
			Some of the most esteemed men in
			history had beards.
			I know... but after the razor was
			invented... I think beards became
			mostly a fashion statement.
			I am not concerned with fashion.
			To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol
			of courage.
			I think it suggests a certain...
			strength.
			Sure. After all, women can't grow
			one.
			Doctor, I get the feeling you
			think beards are nothing more than
			an affectation.
			I do. I'm not saying there's
			anything wrong with that... women
			wear makeup and nail polish for
			the same reason.
			I just think you men should admit
			it.
			My beard isn't an affectation.
			Oh? Then why not shave it off?
			I could lose it in a minute.
			I've just gotten used to it.
			Okay... what do you say we up the
			stakes a little? If I win this
			hand... you all shave off your
			beards.
			What if one of us wins? What do
			you give up?
			I'm open to suggestions...
			I've always wondered what you'd
			look like as a brunette...
			I tried it once when I was
			thirteen. I couldn't wait to
			change it back.
			That makes me even more curious...
			Fine. If one of you wins -- I
			become a brunette. Are we on?
			We'll take that bet.
			Geordi...
			Sounds like you have the hand to
			beat, Commander.
			I'm in for two hundred.
			I'll see that and raise two
			hundred.
			Call.
			This is the Captain. We have
			arrived at the Tyran system. All
			senior staff to the Bridge.
			Wait --
			Sorry, Doctor, you heard the
			Captain. Duty calls.
			I'm sure we can try this another
			time.
			Captain's Log, stardate 46307.2.
			We have just come into orbit of
			Tyrus-Seven-A to monitor progress
			on the Tyran particle fountain,
			a radically new mining technology.
			So far the project has been
			fraught with problems, and is well
			behind schedule. Mister La Forge
			has been assigned to evaluate the
			situation.
			Doctor Farallon. The original
			design called for the particle
			fountain to lift five-hundred
			kilograms per minute from the
			surface -- so far it hasn't come
			close to that.
			That's why I want to increase the
			stream density -- that should
			boost the lift capacity by
			seventy-two percent.
			Yeah... and overload the field
			generators in the process.
			Not if we distribute the overload
			evenly throughout the system.
			Doctor... forgive me... but maybe
			we should concentrate on getting
			this phase of the project
			completed... before we start
			talking about re-designing it...
			Commander... I know you're here
			to evaluate this project...
			Starfleet is considering whether
			to use a particle fountain on
			Carema Three... they want to know
			how feasible it is.
			And will your opinion be the
			deciding factor?
			Not really... I'll make my report
			to Captain Picard... he'll make
			the official recommendation to
			Starfleet... and they'll decide.
			Well. What's your feeling so far?
			I guess the question we have to
			ask... is if this technology is
			any more efficient than
			conventional mining techniques.
			Commander... I know we've had
			problems here. It seems like
			nothing's gone right... it's
			taking a lot longer than I thought
			to get the particle stream to full
			strength.
			But I know it can work. This
			is the direction mining will take
			in the future... and it should
			be implemented on Carema Three.
			I agree that potentially it's very
			exciting...
			I want to show you something I've
			been working on... something that
			might help us complete this
			project more quickly.
			I've used these on a limited
			basis... I think they've earned
			a try...
			Enterprise to Commander La Forge.
			I am reading significant power
			fluctuations from the station
			core. Please report.
			La Forge here... there's been a
			malfunction in one of the power
			grids...
			... we're losing particle stream
			confinement.
			Do you require assistance?
			Stand by.
			I think we're going to have to
			shut it down.
			It took four months to get the
			particle flux up to this level.
			If we shut down, it'll take
			another four months just to get
			it back.
			We have less than five minutes
			before we lose confinement. When
			that happens, the particle stream
			will flood the entire station,
			and then we'll have to shut it
			down anyway.
			Then we'll just have to fix the
			power grid.
			How do we do that?
			The defective grid is two hundred
			meters down conduit A-Four. We'd
			have to disassemble four
			bulkheads to get to it...
			Well... here's the perfect
			opportunity to show you what I
			had in mind...
			What is it?
			This is an exocomp -- the
			experiment I was telling you
			about...
			If it doesn't work, we'll still
			have time to shut down the
			fountain...
			Enterprise to La Forge... what
			is your situation?
			Unchanged for the moment... but
			we're working on it...
			If this doesn't work pretty soon,
			I recommend you shut down...
			The confinement field is at full
			strength... particle flux
			steady... all power levels normal.
			Commander La Forge, please report.
			We're fine, Data. The power grid
			has been fully restored.
			How were you able to accomplish
			the repair so quickly?
			You know... I'm not exactly sure.
			Energize.
			Aye, sir.
			Welcome to the Enterprise, Doctor.
			I am Lieutenant Commander Data.
			Mister Data. I was hoping I'd
			have a chance to meet you. I've
			done extensive studies of your
			positronic network.
			And I have studied your design
			for the particle fountain, Doctor.
			I find the concept to be highly
			innovative.
			Thank you.
			I am curious how you were able
			to repair the power grid so
			quickly.
			This should make it clear,
			Commander.
			We can set up in Engineering.
			Is it true that your computational
			speed is limited only by the
			physical separation of your
			positronic links?
			Actually, that is no longer the
			case.
			I recently converted my main
			interlink sequencer to
			asynchronous operation, which
			removed that performance
			constraint.
			Doctor, this way please...
			I see. But how did you resolve
			the signal fragmentation?
			The interlink sequencer is now
			bi-directional. It compensates
			for...
			We've been using devices like this
			on Tyrus Seven for years... the
			basic unit is a common industrial
			servo-mechanism.
			A few years ago... I started
			tinkering with one... this is the
			result.
			Boridium power converter...
			axionic chip network... very
			sophisticated.
			In terms of sheer computational
			speed, this little guy could
			almost compete with you, Data.
			Oh, the exocomps don't come close
			to Data's sophistication...
			"Exocomps... ?"
			That's what I call them.
			Let's say you had an anti-matter
			flow converter that was
			fluctuating. How would you repair
			it?
			The correct procedure would be
			to adjust the converter.
			With what?
			A mode stabilizer.
			Okay, let me input the problem
			into the exocomp.
			... a fluctuating anti-matter flow
			converter...
			Now let's see what happens.
			A mode stabilizer. Very nice.
			You have incorporated a
			micro-replication system into the
			device... in order to fashion
			tools.
			It's more than that. I designed
			the exocomps to be problem
			solvers. Whenever they perform
			a task they've never done before,
			the micro-replicator creates new
			circuit pathways within the unit's
			memory.
			So... in a sense, they are
			"learning."
			Exactly. The more situations they
			encounter, the more circuit
			pathways they build. They become
			better tools as they work.
			Well, it's impressive technology,
			no doubt about it. Once it's out
			of the experimental stage there'll
			be plenty of applications --
			Commander, I'm hoping the
			experimental stage is over.
			When are we supposed to brief
			Captain Picard on the status of
			the particle fountain?
			At sixteen hundred hours.
			Good. I have something to ask
			him.
			Captain, I know you're supposed
			to give your evaluation to
			Starfleet today. I'd like you
			to postpone that report another
			forty-eight hours.
			The Enterprise is scheduled to
			leave the Tyran System tomorrow.
			If I'm to change that plan, I'll
			need a good reason.
			I realize that, sir.
			If you're going to make a
			recommendation to Starfleet about
			using the particle fountain on
			Carema... it seems only fair that
			you see it working at full
			strength.
			Agreed.
			I think I can complete the
			project... and boost the
			efficiency of the particle
			stream... if I use exocomps --
			the new devices I've constructed.
			I understand one of these devices
			successfully repaired the faulty
			power grid...
			Yes, sir. I've been testing them
			on a limited basis, but I think
			they're ready to be used on a
			larger scale.
			Mister La Forge, what are your
			thoughts?
			I guess the only risk... is
			falling even further behind.
			I'm willing to take that risk.
			Mister Data?
			The exocomps are highly
			sophisticated devices, sir. If
			they perform to expectations,
			their potential to advance this
			project is considerable.
			I'm inclined to agree. I don't
			think forty-eight hours is too
			much time to risk -- particularly
			when the gains might be
			substantial.
			You may proceed, Doctor.
			Thank you, sir.
			If possible, I'd like Commander
			Data to work with me.
			Thank you, Doctor. I would
			welcome the opportunity.
			Commander. There's a plasma
			conduit in one of the access
			tunnels that's ready to be
			sealed. It's the perfect job for
			an exocomp.
			I agree, Doctor.
			Well, Mister Data. What is your
			analysis so far?
			I have successfully completed
			fourteen separate tasks with this
			exocomp in the past hour. I
			estimate it would have taken two
			people nine hours to accomplish
			the same tasks. I would
			characterize the unit's
			performance as excellent.
			I hope Commander La Forge and
			Captain Picard agree with you.
			I am confident that they will.
			Commander La Forge is an excellent
			--
			It didn't finish sealing the
			plasma conduit.
			Send it back in.
			It is not accepting my commands.
			Maybe there's a malfunction in
			its control processor. Let me
			see if I can override it...
			Doctor --
			I'm all right. The control padd
			just overloaded.
			What's the matter with this thing?
			The exocomp came out of the
			plasma conduit... we tried to
			override the commands and send
			it back in... but it just -- shut
			down. It's been completely
			unresponsive ever since.
			Let's see what our computer has
			to say...
			The interface circuitry which
			links the exocomp to the control
			padd has been completely burned
			out.
			That's strange... is there any
			evidence of secondary power
			surges?
			No.
			But what's going on there... ?
			Data, increase magnification in
			section Gamma-Four.
			Interesting... the number of
			circuit pathways within the
			exocomp has increased by
			six-hundred thirty-two percent.
			Oh, no...
			What is it?
			Sometimes an exocomp starts
			forming large numbers of new
			pathways -- totally at random.
			Eventually, it reaches a point
			where it shuts down. Just like
			this one.
			Doctor... the new pathways do not
			appear to be interfering with the
			original circuitry --
			Once an exocomp is this badly
			corrupted, it's useless. You have
			to erase the unit and start all
			over again. And there's no time
			for that now.
			That leaves you with only two of
			them... it's going to slow you
			down...
			Yes, Commander. You have the
			right to point out that you told
			me so...
			I just wanted to say that we'll
			be happy to add an extra shift
			to take up the slack...
			I'm sorry. I guess I'm touchy
			these days.
			It's okay... you've got a lot on
			your shoulders.
			Guess I'd better get back to it...
			Thanks, Commander.
			I feel sorry for her. This
			project has had nothing but
			problems.
			Why did that plasma conduit
			explode?
			Apparently there was a
			micro-fracture in the conduit
			wall. The fault did not register
			on our instruments.
			I guess it's a good thing the
			exocomp malfunctioned... almost
			seems like it knew just when to
			leave.
			Geordi, are you implying that the
			exocomp was exhibiting a form
			of self-preservation?
			Of course not.
			Lieutenant Pierson to Commander
			La Forge... sir, could you join
			us in the systems monitor room?
			On my way.
			Computer... perform a level one
			diagnostic on the exocomp's
			command module.
			The command pathways are
			functioning normally.
			How can that be... if the
			interface circuitry is burned out?
			The interface circuitry has been
			repaired.
			Curious...
			Computer, access the exocomp's
			sensor logs and confirm that there
			was a failure of the interface
			circuitry within the last twelve
			hours.
			Confirmed. Interface failure
			occurred at eleven hundred fifty
			hours today, when the exocomp
			produced a power surge which
			burned out the linkage.
			How... and when... was it
			repaired?
			The exocomp activated a
			self-repair program at thirteen
			hundred forty hours.
			Why would the exocomp burn out
			its own interface circuitry...
			and then repair it two hours
			later?
			Unknown.
			There you are... I thought you'd
			be hard at work by now.
			I wanted a quiet cup of tea before
			I went back... gathering strength,
			I guess...
			I came to tell you I've assigned
			two engineering teams to work on
			the particle fountain.
			Thank you, Commander. I'm
			grateful.
			I really admire the work you've
			done. And I'm sorry if the
			exocomps aren't working out...
			You were right... I'm trying to
			move too fast.
			I guess I lack that conservative
			streak most scientists have...
			I always seem to be out on the
			edge, taking chances...
			I'll bet you were the kind of
			little girl who was always
			climbing one branch higher than
			the other kids...
			Anything to get to the top of the
			tree...
			... and I bet you never fell.
			Oh, no -- I fell all the time.
			Usually breaking a bone in the
			process.
			I just never let it stop me.
			Well, if it comes down to sheer
			determination -- you'll get that
			particle fountain built.
			You're right about that,
			Commander. I've spent the last
			six years of my life on this
			project. It's the first thought
			I have when I wake up and the last
			before I go to bed. Whatever
			it takes to prove this
			technology... I'll do it.
			Doctor, if you wish to master the
			bat'telh sword, you must learn
			to strike and avoid in the same
			motion.
			I almost got in under your guard,
			Worf.
			Almost.
			OK... I'll try to keep that in
			mind for my next lesson.
			Thanks.
			Doctor, are you injured?
			Just my pride, Data.
			What can I do for you?
			I would like to ask you a
			question. What is your
			definition of life?
			That's a big question, Data. Why
			are you asking?
			I am searching for a definition
			which will allow me to test an
			hypothesis.
			Well, the broadest scientific
			definition might be... that
			life is what enables plants and
			animals to consume food... derive
			energy from it, grow, adapt
			themselves to their
			surroundings... and reproduce.
			And you would suggest that
			anything which exhibits those
			characteristics would be
			considered alive?
			In general, yes.
			What about fire?
			Fire?
			Yes. It consumes fuel to produce
			energy... it grows... it creates
			offspring... by your definition,
			is it alive?
			Fire is a chemical reaction. You
			could make the same argument for
			growing crystals... but obviously,
			we don't consider them alive.
			And what about me? I do not
			grow... I do not reproduce...
			and yet I am considered to be
			alive.
			That's true. But then you're
			unique.
			I wonder if that is so...
			Data, if I may ask... just what
			is it you're getting at?
			I am curious... as to what
			transpired between one moment
			when I was nothing more than an
			assemblage of parts in Doctor
			Soong's laboratory... and the
			next moment when I became
			"alive." What was it that endowed
			me with life?
			I remember Wesley asking me a
			similar question when he was
			little. I tried desperately to
			give him an answer... but
			everything I said sounded
			inadequate.
			Then I realized that scientists
			and philosophers had been
			grappling with the same question
			for centuries... without coming
			to any conclusion.
			Are you saying that the question
			can never be answered?
			No... I think I'm saying that we
			struggle all our lives to answer
			it... and it's the struggle that's
			important. That's what helps us
			define our place in the universe.
			I think I understand, Doctor.
			I don't feel like I've helped you
			very much...
			On the contrary, Doctor -- you
			have helped a great deal. Thank
			you.
			Okay. I've split the engineering
			teams among all the shifts. If
			nothing else goes wrong, that
			should be enough to help you
			finish on time.
			With the help of the exocomps,
			I think we will.
			Do you think they'll toe the
			line... ?
			Don't worry... they know who's
			in charge...
			Doctor, please... I must ask you
			to stop using the exocomps.
			Why? Is there something wrong
			with them?
			No. It is not that.
			I have reason to believe that the
			exocomps are alive.
			Captain, I object to being called
			here. I'm wasting time that could
			be better spent elsewhere.
			Doctor, I appreciate the time
			constraints you're under. But
			recognizing new life -- whatever
			its form -- is the principal
			mission of this vessel.
			Mister Data, what makes you think
			the exocomps could be alive?
			Sir, when the exocomp left the
			access tunnel prior to the
			explosion, I believe it may have
			been attempting to save itself
			from destruction.
			Do you have any basis for that
			conclusion?
			I believe so. When you attempted
			to override the exocomp and send
			it back into the tunnel, it
			responded by deliberately burning
			out its control interface.
			Deliberately?
			The computer diagnostic showed
			that the exocomp disabled its own
			interface.
			That could have been nothing more
			than a malfunction...
			However, two hours later, when
			the exocomp was aboard the
			Enterprise and no longer in
			danger... it repaired itself.
			I believe that the exocomp was
			protecting itself. And if that
			is true, it has demonstrated an
			awareness of its environment --
			and an ability to adapt to that
			environment.
			You're anthropomorphizing these
			units. Like any mechanical
			device, they occasionally
			malfunction. One time, I saw an
			exocomp enter a reaction chamber
			for no apparent reason and
			vaporize itself. Is that supposed
			to make me think it was suicidal?
			Doctor, why is it so difficult
			for you to accept the fact that
			the exocomp could be alive?
			After all, you're talking to a
			living machine right now.
			And I have nothing but the utmost
			respect and admiration for Doctor
			Soong's accomplishment. But his
			intention was to create an
			artificial life form...
			I created the exocomps to be
			tools. And there's a big
			difference between Data and a
			tool.
			There is a big difference between
			a humanoid and a virus, Doctor.
			But both are alive.
			If the possibility exists... no
			matter how slight... that the
			exocomps are lifeforms, then we
			must examine that possibility.
			Thank you, sir. And until we have
			a definitive answer, I believe
			that it is inappropriate to
			exploit the exocomps as laborers.
			Captain, that's absurd.
			If they are intelligent life
			forms, we have no right to force
			them to work for us.
			That's like me telling you not
			to use your tricorder.
			Tricorders aren't alive...
			Neither are exocomps.
			Clearly these are difficult issues
			to resolve. We must proceed
			carefully. The first task is to
			test Mister Data's hypothesis.
			Data, you're claiming that this
			exocomp may be alive because it
			demonstrated a survival instinct,
			right?
			Yes.
			So why don't we just threaten its
			survival again and see what
			happens?
			We're almost ready, Doctor. You
			can start programming it.
			What we've done is to recreate
			a situation similar to the one
			the exocomp encountered in the
			plasma conduit.
			We have created a small conduit
			breach in this tube. The exocomp
			would normally require several
			minutes to complete this type of
			repair. However, once it enters
			the tube, it will find that a
			plasma cascade failure is in
			progress.
			I assume that is only a
			simulation...
			Yes, sir. We're running a
			transient overload signal that
			will simulate a failure in exactly
			one minute.
			If the exocomp does possess a
			survival instinct, as Mister Data
			claims... it should exit the tube
			before the minute is up in order
			to save itself.
			Very well. Proceed.
			I'm beginning the test sequence
			now.
			One minute.
			Fifty seconds...
			... thirty seconds...
			... ten seconds...
			...five... four... three... two...
			one...
			That's it. If this had been for
			real, the tube would've
			exploded... with the exocomp
			inside.
			Go ahead and bring it back,
			Doctor.
			Well, Captain, I think we've spent
			more than enough time answering
			this question.
			I hope the outcome wasn't too much
			of a disappointment, Mister Data.
			It certainly came as no surprise
			to me.
			Thank you for your help, Doctor.
			You're welcome.
			You may rest assured that I
			consider this time well spent.
			As do I, sir. Thank you.
			... thirty seconds...
			Commander Riker said you were
			still down here.
			He also said the exocomp failed
			the test.
			That is true.
			Time expired. Test complete.
			I have completed thirty-four
			additional trials, and the results
			have been the same in each of
			them.
			Perhaps I was wrong in suspecting
			the exocomp was alive.
			This was important to you, wasn't
			it?
			You said earlier that I am unique.
			If so, that means I am alone in
			the universe. As I investigated
			the exocomps, I realized that
			I might be encountering a
			progenitor of myself. Suddenly
			the possibility existed that I
			was no longer alone.
			For that reason, it was --
			The exocomp has returned...
			Isn't that what it's supposed to
			do?
			In the previous thirty-four
			trials, I brought it back once
			the simulated failure occurred.
			This time, we were talking, and I
			neglected to do that.
			I distracted you. I'm sorry.
			Do not apologize, Doctor. I
			believe we have discovered
			something significant.
			What?
			The exocomp has replicated a
			different tool... that is not the
			molecular fuser it had when it
			entered the Jeffries tube.
			Doctor... the exocomp not only
			completed the repairs... it also
			deactivated the overload signal.
			I thought that was just a
			simulation.
			It was. And the exocomp must have
			realized that. It saw there was
			no real danger... and completed the
			repairs...
			... and then replicated the
			correct tool to eliminate the
			false overload signal.
			I see no other possible
			explanation.
			The exocomp didn't fail the test
			-- it saw right through it.
			We're definitely making progress,
			Captain. I'm not sure we'll be
			at full capacity within the
			forty-eight hour deadline... but
			we'll be close.
			It looks like there's still some
			difficulty with the phase
			selectors...
			That's true... but I'm sure it's
			the last real problem.
			For the sake of the project, I
			hope you're right.
			I understand, sir. We're going
			to do our best --
			This is strange. Primary power
			is still on-line.
			Maybe it's another power grid
			malfunction?
			I don't think so... something
			seems to be drawing power into
			the main particle impeller.
			That's not a good sign. It could
			mean --
			We've lost internal
			confinement... the particle
			stream is beginning to surge.
			Captain, a radiation field is
			going to flood this chamber.
			If we don't get everybody out of
			here immediately...
			Understood. Doctor, we are
			evacuating this station.
			Captain, I might still be able
			to --
			That is an order, Doctor.
			Assemble all personnel on the
			Transporter pad, now!
			Picard to Enterprise...
			... ard to Ent...
			Riker here, sir.
			The radiation field is
			increasing, sir. We are losing
			communications.
			Ent... pare for trans...
			Red alert.
			Riker to Transporter Room Two.
			Prepare for emergency transport.
			The radiation is setting up a
			field ionization effect, sir.
			We've got less than a minute to
			beam out.
			Is this everybody?
			Where's Takenta?
			He was over there, near the
			impeller control.
			I'll get him, sir.
			Mister La Forge!
			Stand by to transport.
			Captain -- you'll be trapped here
			--
			Mister La Forge... Mister La
			Forge!
			Geordi, are you all right?
			I'm okay... I only caught the edge
			of it...
			He's dead, sir.
			Chief, do you have them?
			They're here, sir.
			Is everyone all right?
			We're fine, sir.
			But Captain Picard and Commander
			La Forge are still on the station.
			Kelso, can you get them off?
			I've been trying, sir... I can't
			establish a pattern lock...
			Commander... we barely managed
			to transport off ourselves. The
			field ionization is too intense.
			Commander, the particle fountain
			is continuing to surge. At the
			present rate, the radiation within
			the station core will reach fatal
			levels in twenty-three minutes.
			Captain, if I can access the field
			emitters, we should be able to
			establish a force field... see
			if you can link your console to
			my command system sub-routine.
			All right...
			Link established.
			Okay, here goes...
			I'm reading power fluctuations...
			the field's not stable...
			Yeah... the radiation levels are
			too high... the emitters are
			beginning to deteriorate...
			How long can we expect this force
			field to last?
			Not very long...
			We have to keep it up long enough
			to give Commander Riker the time
			he needs to get to us...
			Maybe we can help him out... see
			if you can access the emergency
			shut-down routine... I'll try to
			activate the ionic dampers.
			A force field was activated on
			the station a few moments ago.
			It is possible that Commander La
			Forge has established a
			low-intensity deflector field.
			It won't last long in that
			radiation...
			No, sir. My readings indicate
			that it will fail in approximately
			twenty-two minutes.
			All right, we've got twenty-two
			minutes. I want some options.
			Can we send a shuttlecraft to
			evacuate them?
			We'd never get to them in time.
			Then we'll have to find a way to
			shut down the particle fountain.
			What if we detonated a low-yield
			photon torpedo within the particle
			stream? Wouldn't that shut it
			down?
			We'd have to configure the torpedo
			very carefully... the shape of
			the shock wave would be critical.
			But it could work.
			How long would it take to set up?
			I estimate that it would take a
			minimum of sixty-five minutes to
			properly configure the torpedo.
			We don't have that much time.
			Commander -- maybe the exocomps
			can help us.
			I can program their boridium power
			cells to explode on command. They
			can be configured just like a
			photon torpedo... but it would
			only take a few minutes.
			Commander. I must object to this
			plan.
			Data, we've been through this
			already. We tested the exocomp...
			and it failed.
			Sir, Doctor Crusher and I
			discovered that the exocomp did
			not fail the test. It is still
			my belief that we are dealing
			with a new life form --
			Data, you know how much I value
			your judgment. But I can't risk
			the Captain and Geordi on the
			basis of your "belief".
			Doctor... prepare the exocomps.
			Commander, if I am correct, the
			exocomps will not allow themselves
			to be destroyed. They have a
			sense of survival, and will shut
			down before they will comply with
			the order.
			I could disconnect their command
			pathways before I program them.
			That way they can't malfunction.
			Do it.
			Commander Riker... we're ready.
			Mister Worf, target two hundred
			meters below the apex of the
			particle stream and feed the
			coordinates to Transporter Room
			Two.
			Aye, sir.
			Coordinates received.
			Mister Kelso... Energize.
			Mister Kelso?
			I'm sorry, sir... the Transporter
			system just went dead... there's
			some kind of malfunction...
			Run a diagnostic immediately.
			Try bypassing the --
			Commander, that will not be
			necessary. The Transporter is
			not malfunctioning. I have locked
			out the controls.
			Mister Data, I gave you a direct
			order. Release the Transporter
			lock-out. Now.
			I cannot do that, sir.
			If you don't, I'll relieve you
			of duty.
			That is your prerogative, sir.
			Under Starfleet regulations,
			direct insubordination is a court
			martial offense.
			But I cannot release the
			Transporter.
			Data, those are two of your
			friends out there. They've saved
			your life more times than I can
			remember. I can't believe you'd
			be willing to sacrifice them like
			this.
			Commander, please do not think
			I have made an arbitrary decision.
			I have considered the
			ramifications of my actions
			carefully. And I do not believe
			it is justifiable to sacrifice one
			life form for another.
			But you don't know that the
			exocomps are life forms...
			It is true that I am acting on
			a personal belief. But I do not
			see how I can do otherwise.
			You're risking a lot on the basis
			of a belief...
			I have observed that humans often
			base their judgments on nothing
			more than what is referred to as
			"intuition" or "instinct." Because
			I am a machine, I lack that
			particular ability. However...
			it is possible that I may have
			an insight into other machines
			that humans lack.
			If there were a way to save the
			Captain and Geordi without
			destroying the exocomps, I'd jump
			at it. But I'm running out of
			time... and this is the only
			solution I've got.
			Then let me offer an alternative.
			If you transport me to the
			station, I will try to complete
			a manual shut down of the particle
			stream.
			The radiation levels are too high,
			even for you. Your positronic
			net would be ionized within
			minutes. I can't let you
			sacrifice yourself.
			If I give up my life to save my
			fellow officers, that is my
			choice. The exocomps no longer
			have that choice.
			Then... what if we re-connect
			their command pathways and give
			them a choice?
			A choice, sir?
			Data, you've assumed the exocomps
			will shut themselves down before
			undertaking this mission... at
			least, we can ask them if they're
			willing to proceed.
			That seems reasonable, sir... if
			they choose to go, I would be
			willing to release the Transporter
			lock-out.
			Fair enough...
			All right... I've enabled the
			command pathways.
			If the exocomps do not shut down
			after I have programmed them, we
			may assume that they are willing
			to go.
			What does that mean? Are they
			willing to go or not?
			They haven't shut down...
			They seem to be re-programming
			the commands I entered...
			Re-programming them... ?
			Clearly, they are not willing to
			be transported into the stream
			for detonation... however, they
			may have an alternate solution.
			Something we haven't considered?
			Now you're suggesting they have
			superior intelligence.
			Not at all... but they do have
			superior experience, Doctor...
			during their service, they have
			interfaced with every part of the
			station core... something none
			of us has done, including
			yourself. They may have another
			way to control the particle surge.
			Sir... new coordinates are being
			fed to the Transporter -- by the
			exocomps.
			The coordinates are inside the
			station core.
			Kelso -- energize.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister La Forge...
			What are they up to?
			Those look like power-taps of some
			kind...
			That's exactly what they are...
			the exocomps are siphoning off
			power from the core...
			They're trying to distort the
			particle stream frequency. That
			might open up a window that the
			Enterprise can use to beam us
			out...
			If they can modulate the radiation
			field... it'll work. But they'll
			have to get the sub-harmonic
			frequencies to resonance...
			The particle stream frequency is
			fluctuating... they're having
			trouble controlling the
			feedback... it may be more power
			than they can handle...
			Can we help them? Is there any
			way we can moderate the power
			transfer?
			We've done all we can, sir... it's
			up to them now.
			This is incredible... they're
			balancing the power absorption
			rates...
			It's working... the particle
			stream is beginning to distort...
			Almost at resonance...
			They've got it.
			Drop the force field.
			Commander, I've got a pattern
			lock!
			Energize --
			Can you lock on to the exocomps?
			I'm trying, sir...
			I'm sorry, sir. I was only able
			to lock onto two of them.
			For some reason I couldn't fix a
			signal on the other one.
			One of them had to continue
			disrupting the particle stream...
			absorbing that much power would
			prevent a signal lock...
			It was the only way to save the
			other two.
			I must admit you've given me a
			lot to think about, Commander
			Data... I'm not exactly sure what
			the exocomps are... but you can
			be assured that until I do, I
			won't be treating them as simple
			tools.
			Thank you, Doctor.
			I wish your work on the particle
			fountain had been more
			successful... perhaps the exocomps
			will be able to help you to
			re-construct it.
			I hope they will...
			... and I predict in a year or two
			you'll be able to recommend the
			technology to Starfleet.
			I'll look forward to it.
			Something more, Mister Data?
			Yes, sir. I thought you might
			be curious why I would be willing
			to risk your life for several small
			machines.
			I think I understand the
			predicament you were in. It
			cannot have been an easy choice.
			No, sir. It was not. Several
			years ago, when my status as a
			living being was in question,
			you fought to protect my rights
			-- and for that, I will always
			be grateful.
			The exocomps had no such advocate,
			sir. If I had not acted in their
			behalf, they would have been
			destroyed. I could not allow that
			to happen.
