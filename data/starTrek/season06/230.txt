			I have identified the signal,
			Captain. It is from the U.S.S.
			Jenolan, a Federation transport
			ship reported missing in this
			sector seventy-five years ago.
			Code one alpha zero. Ship in
			distress.
			Bring us out of warp, Ensign.
			All stop.
			Aye, sir.
			Report.
			We have entered a massive
			gravitational field.
			There are no stars or other
			stellar bodies listed on our
			navigational charts. However,
			sensors indicate the presence of
			an extremely strong gravitational
			source in this vicinity.
			Can you localize the source of
			the gravity field?
			Sensors?
			I am having difficulty scanning
			the object. However, it would
			appear to be approximately two
			hundred million kilometers in
			diameter.
			That's nearly the size of Earth's
			orbit around the sun.
			Why didn't we detect it before
			now?
			The object's enormous mass is
			causing a great deal of
			gravimetric interference. That
			might have prevented our sensors
			from detecting the object before
			we dropped out of warp.
			Mister Data, could this be a...
			Dyson Sphere?
			This object does fit the general
			parameters of Dyson's theory.
			A Dyson Sphere?
			There is no comparative data,
			Captain. However, this object
			does fit the general parameters
			of Dyson's theory.
			A Dyson Sphere?
			It's a very old theory, Number
			One. I'm not surprised you
			haven't heard of it. A twentieth
			century physicist, Freeman Dyson,
			postulated that an enormous hollow
			sphere could be constructed around
			a star. This would have the
			advantage of harnessing all the
			radiant energy of the star. A
			population living on the interior
			surface would therefore have a
			virtually inexhaustible source
			of power.
			Are you saying there might be
			people living in there?
			Possibly a great number of people,
			Commander. The interior surface
			area of a sphere this size would
			be equivalent to more than two
			hundred fifty million class M
			planets.
			Sir. I have located the distress
			signal. It is coming from a point
			on the northern hemisphere.
			Ensign Rager, take us into
			synchronous orbit above that
			position.
			We are holding relative position
			at thirty thousand kilometers
			above the surface.
			I have found the Jenolan,
			Captain. It has impacted on the
			surface of the sphere.
			There are no life signs.
			However, there are several small
			power emanations... and life
			support is still functioning at
			minimal levels.
			Bridge to Engineering. Geordi,
			meet me in Transporter Room Three.
			Mister Worf.
			The air's pretty stale.
			Life support is barely operating.
			See if you can increase the oxygen
			level.
			Commander.
			The Transporter is still
			on-line... it's being fed power
			from the auxiliary systems.
			The rematerialization subroutine
			has been disabled.
			That's not all... the phase
			inducers are connected to the
			emitter array... the override
			is completely gone... and the
			pattern buffer's been locked into
			a continuous diagnostic cycle.
			This doesn't make any sense...
			locking the unit in a diagnostic
			mode just sends inert matter
			through the pattern buffer. Why
			would anyone want to --
			There's a pattern still in the
			buffer.
			It's completely intact... less
			than point zero zero three
			percent signal degradation. How
			is that possible?
			I don't know... but I've never
			seen a transporter system
			jury-rigged like this.
			Could someone... survive in a
			Transporter buffer for
			seventy-five years?
			I know a way to find out.
			Thank you, Lads.
			We've got to get Franklin out of
			there.
			Someone else's pattern is still
			in the buffer?
			Aye. Matt Franklin. We went
			in together.
			Something's wrong... one of the
			inducers has failed...
			Boost the gain on the matter
			stream.
			Come on, Franklin... I know
			you're still in there...
			It's no use... his pattern's been
			degraded by fifty-three percent...
			he's gone.
			I'm sorry.
			So am I... he was a good lad...
			I'm Commander William Riker from
			the starship Enterprise.
			The Enterprise... I shoulda known.
			And I'll bet it was Jim Kirk
			himself who hauled the old girl
			out of mothballs to come looking
			for me.
			Captain Montgomery Scott. How
			long have I been missing?
			Well...
			Sir.
			I have restored life support.
			The oxygen levels will return
			to normal shortly.
			Captain Scott... Lieutenant Worf.
			Lieutenant?
			Yes.
			Captain Scott... perhaps there
			are a few things we should talk
			about.
			We should probably get you to
			Sickbay. Doctor Crusher will be
			able to...
			You've changed the resonator
			array... only three phase
			inverters...
			Geordi, I think our guest is going
			to have a lot of engineering
			questions...
			I'll take care of him, sir.
			What have ye done to the duotronic
			enhancers?
			Those were replaced with isolinear
			chips about forty years ago. It's
			a lot more efficient now.
			Uh... be careful there. That's
			an EPS power tap.
			Ah.
			You were saying earlier that you
			were on your way to the Norpin
			Colony when you had a warp engine
			failure...
			That's right. We had an overload
			in one of the plasma transfer
			conduits. The Captain brought
			us out of warp... we hit some
			gravimetric interference and then
			there it was, as big as life...
			Is that a conduit interface?
			Yeah. Uh, big as life... the
			Dyson Sphere, right?
			Aye. An actual Dyson Sphere.
			Can you imagine the engineering
			skills needed to even design such
			a structure...
			I know... it's pretty amazing.
			What happened when you first
			approached it?
			We began a standard survey of the
			surface. We were just completing
			the initial orbital scan when our
			aft power coils suddenly exploded.
			The ship got caught in the
			sphere's gravity well... and down
			we went.
			Franklin and I were the only ones
			to survive the crash...
			What made you think of using the
			Transporter pattern buffer to stay
			alive?
			We didna have enough supplies to
			wait for a rescue... so I had to
			think of something.
			But locking it into a diagnostic
			cycle to keep the signal from
			degrading... and cross connecting
			the phase inducers to provide
			a regenerative power source...
			it's brilliant.
			I'm afraid it was only fifty
			percent brilliant... Ensign
			Franklin deserved better.
			I think you're going to like the
			twenty-fourth century, Mister
			Scott. We've made some pretty
			incredible advances in the last
			eighty years.
			Aye... from what I can see you've
			got a fine ship here, Mister La
			Forge... a real beauty. In fact,
			I must admit to being a little
			overwhelmed.
			Wait until you see the Holodeck.
			You've had a hairline fracture
			of the humerus.
			It'll ache for a few days, but
			it should be fine.
			Thank you.
			Well, I'll say this for your
			Enterprise... the doctors are a
			fair sight prettier.
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
			Captain Scott.
			Thank you, sir -- and call me
			Scotty.
			How are you feeling?
			I don't know. How am I feeling?
			Other than a couple of bumps and
			bruises, I'd say you feel fine
			for a man of a hundred and
			forty-seven.
			I don't feel a day over a hundred
			and twenty.
			I must say I was more than a
			little surprised when Commander
			Riker informed me you were aboard
			the Jenolan. Our records didn't
			list you as one of their crew.
			I wasn't actually a member of the
			crew. I was just a... passenger.
			I was heading for Norpin Five to
			settle down and enjoy my...
			retirement.
			I see. Well, I would very much
			enjoy the opportunity to discuss
			your career at some point.
			History is one of my hobbies and
			I'm sure you have some fascinating
			insights into the events of your
			time.
			I'd be happy to.
			Good. I look forward to it.
			Commander, we need to begin a full
			spectrographic analysis of the
			Dyson Sphere.
			I'll get right on it, sir.
			Again, welcome aboard, Captain.
			I have to get back to Engineering
			to start that analysis.
			Engineering. I thought you'd
			never ask.
			Captain... The first thing
			you're going to do is get some
			rest. You've had quite a shock
			to your system and I don't want
			you to push yourself too hard.
			We're pretty busy right now,
			anyway, Captain Scott. But I'd
			be happy to give you a tour of
			Engineering a little later, when
			the doctor says it's okay.
			Aye.
			I'll have someone show you to
			your quarters.
			... this is the food replicator...
			and your computer terminal.
			Good Lord, man... where have you
			put me?
			These are standard guest quarters,
			sir. I can try to find something
			bigger if you want.
			Bigger? In my day, even an
			Admiral wouldna had such quarters
			on a starship. I remember a time
			when we had to transport the
			Dohlman of Elaas. You never heard
			anyone whine and complain about
			quarters like that...
			The Holodecks, Ten Forward, and
			the gymnasium are all at your
			disposal. The computer can tell
			you how to find them. Until we
			issue you a combadge, just use
			one of these panels if you need
			anything.
			You know... these quarters remind
			me of a hotel room I once had on
			Argelius... oh, now there was a
			planet... everything a man could
			want -- right at his fingertips.
			'Course on my first visit, I ran
			into a wee bit of trouble...
			Uh, excuse me, sir... but I have
			to return to duty.
			Ah... well then. Thank you.
			I want you to shut down the warp
			engines and recalibrate the aft
			sensors while I work on the
			lateral array.
			Aye, sir.
			Can I help you, sir?
			I don't think so Lass, but I'll
			let you know if you can.
			Sir, this area is restricted to
			authorized --
			I'll handle it, Bartel.
			Captain Scott, this... really
			isn't a good time --
			We're in Engineering. Call me
			Scotty.
			Scotty... this really isn't a good
			time for a tour. We're running
			a phase seven survey of the Dyson
			Sphere.
			I'm not here for a tour, Lad.
			I'm here to help.
			That's... very kind. But I think
			we can handle it...
			Sensor readings indicate the
			presence of a G-type star at the
			center of the sphere. There also
			appears to be a class-M atmosphere
			clinging to the interior surface.
			Is there any indication that the
			sphere is inhabited?
			Not as yet, sir. Our preliminary
			data indicates it is still capable
			of supporting life, but we have
			been unable to find definite signs
			of current habitation.
			Send out a series of class four
			probes to survey the far side of
			the sphere. Perhaps we'll have
			more luck with them.
			Aye, sir.
			Adjust the frequency
			stabilization on the main
			deflector dish. It's out of synch
			with the aft sensors.
			Laddie, ye need to phase-lock the
			warp fields within three percent
			or they'll become unstable.
			What?
			Here. The warp field is --
			We use a multi-phase
			auto-containment field now...
			it's meant to operate above three
			percent.
			Ah. Well... that would make all
			the difference.
			We can re-start the engines in
			ten minutes, Commander.
			Thank you.
			I remember a time when the old
			Enterprise was spiralling in
			toward Psi two thousand... the
			Captain wanted to try a cold start
			of the warp engines. I told him
			that without a proper phase-lock
			it would take at least thirty
			minutes...
			Huh? Oh, thanks.
			"You canna change the laws of
			physics" I said... but of course
			he wouldn't listen so we had to
			come up with a new engine start-up
			routine...
			Do you know that your dilithium
			crystals are about to fracture?
			We recomposite the crystals while
			they're still inside the
			articulation frame. I'd like
			to explain everything, but the
			Captain wants this
			spectrographic-analysis done by
			thirteen hundred hours.
			Would you mind a little advice?
			Starship captains are like
			children. They want everything
			right now and they want it their
			way... the secret is to give them
			what they need, not what they
			want.
			I told him I'd have that analysis
			done in an hour.
			And how long will it really take
			you?
			An hour.
			Ye didna tell him how long it was
			really going to take you?
			Of course I did.
			Oh... Laddie. You've got a lot
			to learn if you want them to think
			of you as a miracle worker.
			You've got to --
			Look, sir. I've tried to be
			patient, I've tried to be polite.
			But I've got a job to do here.
			And you're... in the way.
			I was driving starships while your
			great grandfather was still in
			diapers. I'd think you'd be
			grateful for a little help.
			Then I'll leave ye to work, Mister
			La Forge.
			... "in the way"... used to be
			Engineers had a little respect
			for each other... used to matter
			if a man --
			What do you want?
			Is this a bad time?
			Oh... uh, no.
			Captain Montgomery Scott at your
			service. What can I do for you?
			Deanna Troi, ship's counselor...
			and actually I'm here to see if
			there's anything I can do for you.
			Why... thank you, Lass. But I'm
			set for now. The quarters are
			more than adequate... the
			replicator is a wonder...
			I'm glad you're comfortable.
			But I was actually more interested
			in how you feel.
			How I feel?
			Yes. It would be perfectly normal
			to feel disoriented, confused or
			even frightened following the kind
			of extraordinary experience you've
			just had.
			I suppose it's been... a little
			bewildering, yes.
			I'm sure you have a lot of
			questions about what's happened
			over the last seventy-five
			years... if you'd like, I could
			help you access some of our
			historical records... maybe you
			could discover what happened to
			your family... or friends.
			I'm... not ready for that just
			yet. It's a hard thing to realize
			that everyone ye once knew is
			probably...
			Pardon me for asking... but what
			exactly is a... Ship's Counselor?
			I'm here to take care of the
			emotional well-being of our crew.
			And of our guests.
			And you're an officer?
			Yes. They started assigning
			Counselors to starships about
			forty years ago when they realized
			that the pressures of extended
			space travel --
			You're a psychologist.
			Among other things.
			La Forge sent you here, didn't
			he? I may be old, but I'm not
			crazy.
			Geordi didn't send me and I know
			you're not crazy.
			You're damned right I'm not. And
			I don't need a ship's counselor,
			or a psychologist, or whatever
			else you are.
			I know what I need and it's not
			here.
			May I help you, sir?
			Aye, Lad. Scotch. Neat.
			Thank you.
			What in blazes is this?
			Didn't you order Scotch?
			Lad, I was drinking scotch about
			a hundred years before you were
			born and I can tell you that
			whatever this is, it is definitely
			not scotch.
			I believe I may be of some
			assistance. Captain Scott is
			unaware of the existence of
			synthehol.
			Synthehol?
			Yes. It is an alcohol substitute
			which is now normally served
			aboard starships. It simulates
			the appearance, smell, and taste
			of alcohol, but the intoxicating
			affects can be easily dismissed.
			You're not quite... human are you?
			No, sir. I am an android. My
			name is Commander Data.
			Synthetic scotch and synthetic
			commanders...
			I believe Guinan does keep a
			limited supply of non-syntheholic
			products. Perhaps one of them
			would be to your liking.
			What is it?
			It is green.
			Please enter program.
			The android at the bar said you
			could show me my old ship... so
			lemme see it.
			Insufficient data. Please
			specify parameters.
			The Enterprise. Show me the
			Bridge of the Enterprise, you
			chattering piece of...
			There have been five Federation
			ships with that name. Please
			specify by registry number.
			NCC-One-Seven-Oh-One. No bloody
			A, B, C, or, D.
			Program complete. Enter when
			ready.
			Here's to you, Lads...
			I hope I'm not interrupting, but
			I was just coming off duty and
			wanted to see how you were doing.
			Not at all, not at all. Have a
			drink with me, Captain.
			I'm not sure what it is, exactly,
			but I'd be careful if I were you.
			It has a real...
			Aldeberan whiskey.
			Who do you think gave it to
			Guinan?
			Constitution class...
			Aye. You're familiar with it?
			There's one at the fleet museum.
			This is your Enterprise?
			One of them... I actually served
			on two. This was the first...
			she was also the first ship I ever
			served on as Chief Engineer.
			You know, I served aboard eleven
			ships in my career... freighters,
			cruisers, starships,... but this
			is the only one I ever think
			about... the only one I miss.
			The first ship I ever served
			aboard as Captain was called the
			Stargazer... it was an overworked,
			underpowered vessel that was
			always on the verge of flying
			apart at the seams. In every
			measurable way, my Enterprise is
			a superior ship.
			And yet... there are times I miss
			that cramped little Bridge very
			much.
			It's like the first time you fall
			in love... you don't ever love
			a woman quite the way you did that
			first one.
			To the Enterprise and the
			Stargazer... old girlfriends we'll
			never see again.
			What do you think of the
			Enterprise-D?
			She's a beauty... with a good
			crew...
			But... ?
			When I was here, I could tell you
			the speed we were traveling by
			the feel of the deckplates. On
			your ship... I'm in the way.
			Seventy-five years is a long time.
			If you'd like to study some of
			the technical --
			I'm not eighteen. I can't start
			over again like a raw cadet.
			There comes a time when a man
			finds that he can't fall in love
			again... when he knows that it's
			time to stop.
			I don't belong on your ship...
			I belong on this one. This was
			my home. This is where I had a
			purpose. But this isn't real...
			it's just a computer-generated
			fantasy. And I'm just an old man
			trying to hide in it.
			Computer, shut this bloody thing
			off. It's time I acted my age.
			Come.
			Mister La Forge, I understand that
			the Jenolen conducted an extensive
			survey of the Dyson sphere before
			it crashed. Have we been able
			to access those records?
			We tried to download their memory
			core, but it was pretty heavily
			damaged in the crash. We haven't
			been able to get much out of it.
			Perhaps Captain Scott could be
			of use in accessing that material.
			It's possible. He would know
			those systems better than any of
			us. I'll have Lieutenant Bartel
			beam down with him.
			Commander. I'd like you to
			accompany Mister Scott.
			Me, sir?
			This is not an order, Geordi, it
			is a request... one which you are
			free to decline.
			One of the most important things
			in a man's life is the need to
			feel useful. Mister Scott is a
			Starfleet officer... I would like
			him to feel useful again.
			I'll go with him, Captain.
			Thank you.
			Commander, I believe I have found
			something on the sphere which
			could be a communications device.
			There is an antenna array
			approximately four hundred
			thousand kilometers south of our
			present position. It is emitting
			low-intensity subspace signals.
			Can we open a channel?
			Not from our present orbit,
			Commander. The array is currently
			directed away from us.
			Prepare to take us to an orbit
			above those coordinates.
			Captain Picard to the Bridge,
			please.
			Are you feeling all right?
			Never get drunk unless you're
			willing to pay for it the next
			day. I'll manage.
			Okay.
			Energize.
			Sensors indicate that the large
			circle is a portal or airlock,
			possibly leading to the interior
			of the sphere.
			You said you found a
			communications array?
			Yes, sir. It is located on the
			periphery of the hatch.
			This looks like the front door...
			should we ring the bell?
			Mister Worf, open a channel to
			that array.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain! I'm reading intense
			graviton emissions on the surface
			of --
			Some type of tractor beam has
			locked onto us.
			Helm, get us out of here!
			We've lost main power... auxiliary
			power down to twenty percent.
			We are being pulled inside.
			Auxiliary power failing.
			The resonance frequency of the
			tractor beams is incompatible with
			our power systems. Warp and
			impulse engine relays have been
			overloaded. I am attempting to
			compensate.
			The tractor beams have released
			us, sir.
			Hold position here until we can
			get our bearings.
			Full sensor sweep, Mister Data.
			Where are we?
			We are approximately ninety
			million kilometers from the star's
			photosphere.
			I am reading a great deal of
			surface instability. It may
			be--
			Sir. The inertial motion from
			the tractor beams is still carrying
			us forward. The impulse engines
			are off-line and I can't stop
			our momentum. We're falling
			directly into the star.
			The primary computer database
			should be on-line now. Give it
			a try.
			Okay... I've got three access
			lines to the central core...
			still nothing.
			Bunch of old useless, garbage...
			What?
			I said it's old, Mister La Forge.
			It can't handle the interface of
			your power converter.
			This equipment was designed for
			a different era... now it's just
			a lot of junk.
			I don't know... looks like some
			of it has held together pretty
			well.
			It's a century out of date. It's
			just...
			Obsolete.
			That's interesting... because I
			was just thinking that a lot of
			these systems haven't changed much
			in seventy-five years.
			This Transporter is almost
			identical to the ones we use on
			the Enterprise.
			The subspace radio and sensors
			operate on the same basic
			principles, and impulse engine
			design hasn't changed much in two
			hundred years. If it weren't for
			the structural damage, this ship
			could still be in service today.
			Maybe so... but when they can
			build a ship like your Enterprise,
			who'd want to pilot an old bucket
			like this?
			I don't know... if this ship were
			operational I bet it would
			run circles around the Enterprise
			at impulse speeds.
			Just because something's old
			doesn't mean you throw it away.
			We used to have something called
			a dynamic mode converter... you
			wouldna have something like that
			on your Enterprise would ye?
			I haven't seen one of those in
			a long time... but I might have
			something similar.
			La Forge to Enterprise.
			La Forge to Enterprise, come in
			please.
			Interference?
			No...
			They're gone.
			We will enter the sun's
			photosphere in three minutes.
			Maneuvering thrusters?
			I've got thirty percent power...
			it won't be enough to stop us.
			No. But it may be enough to turn
			us into orbit and hold our
			distance from the photosphere.
			Port thrusters ahead full,
			starboard back full.
			Our flight path is changing...
			right ten point seven degrees...
			insufficient to clear the
			photosphere.
			Lieutenant Bartel, divert all
			power from auxiliary relay systems
			to the maneuvering thrusters.
			Our angular deflection is
			increasing. Now at fifteen
			degrees... eighteen... turn
			now twenty point one degrees.
			We're in orbit, Captain. Our
			altitude is one hundred fifty
			thousand kilometers.
			I'll see about getting main power
			back on-line.
			Very well.
			Mister Data, begin a scan of the
			interior surface for life forms.
			I want to know who brought us in
			here and why.
			Aye, sir.
			I can't find them anywhere in
			orbit.
			They could've crashed into the
			sphere like the Jenolen.
			No, we'd be picking up background
			radiation if they'd gone down.
			There's another possibility...
			they could be inside the sphere.
			Maybe.
			Whatever's happened, we've got
			to find them. If we can get these
			engines back on-line, we could
			track them by their impulse ion
			trail.
			Are ye daft? The main drive
			assembly's shot, the inducers
			are melted, and the power
			couplings are wrecked... we'd
			need a week just to get started.
			But we don't have a week, so
			there's no sense crying about it.
			Come on, let's see what we can
			do with your power converter.
			The sphere appears to be
			abandoned.
			Our sensors show that the star
			is extremely unstable. It is
			experiencing severe bursts of
			radiation and matter expulsions.
			That would explain why they
			abandoned it.
			But if there's no one still
			living here, how were we brought
			inside?
			I believe we triggered a series
			of automatic piloting beams which
			were designed to guide ships into
			the sphere.
			Sir. Sensors show a large
			magnetic disturbance on the
			star's surface.
			It is a solar flare, Captain.
			Magnitude: twelve. Class: B.
			Shields?
			Shields are up... but only at
			twenty-three percent.
			The star has entered a period of
			increased activity. Our sensors
			indicate that solar flares will
			continue to grow. In three hours,
			our shields will no longer be
			be sufficient to protect us.
			Shunt the deuterium from the main
			cryo pump to the auxiliary tank.
			The tank can't handle that much
			pressure.
			Where'd you get that idea?
			It's in the impulse engine
			specifications.
			Regulation forty-two slash
			fifteen... "Pressure Variances
			in IRC Tank Storage"?
			Right.
			Forget it. I wrote it.
			A good engineer is always a wee
			bit conservative... at least on
			paper. Just by-pass the secondary
			cut-off valve and boost the
			flow... it'll work.
			Well, if we've done our jobs
			properly, the engines should be
			coming back on line... about...
			now.
			You were right... the auxiliary
			tank is holding.
			The Bridge is yours, Commander.
			Hey, you're the senior officer
			here.
			I may be a captain by rank, but...
			I've never wanted to be anything
			else but an engineer. Take the
			Conn, Geordi.
			All right.
			Shields still holding... but down
			another fifteen percent.
			Riker to Captain.
			Go ahead Number One.
			We've restored helm control...
			and you have partial impulse
			power.
			Good. Stand-by.
			Can we use the phasers to open
			a hole in the sphere?
			No, sir. The exterior shell is
			composed of carbon-neutronium.
			Our weapons would be ineffective.
			Mister Data, we need to find a
			way out of here. Begin scanning
			for another hatch or portal that
			might still be open.
			The interior surface area is over
			ten to the sixteenth square
			kilometers. It will take seven
			hours to completely scan the
			surface.
			I will endeavor to speed up the
			process.
			The Enterprise ion trail leads
			right to this point.
			It looks like some kind of doorway.
			I'll bet you two bottles of scotch
			that they're inside the sphere...
			and that they went in right
			through that hatch.
			No bet here. The question is,
			how?
			Look at the momentum distribution
			of the ions... it would take an
			impulse engine at full reverse
			to put out a signature like that.
			So they didn't go in willingly.
			This looks like some kind of
			communications array.
			Aye. We found hundreds of them
			when we did our initial survey
			seventy-five years ago.
			Did you try hailing them?
			Sure. That was standard
			procedure in my day. We did it
			right before we crashed.
			Hailing is standard procedure
			today, too...
			Scotty, what if these aren't
			communications arrays... what
			if they're access terminals...
			which are triggered by subspace
			signals on certain frequencies...
			Frequencies like our standard
			ship's hail.
			Exactly. When the Enterprise
			saw this terminal they probably
			did the same thing you did
			seventy-five years ago -- opened
			a channel. Only this time it
			triggered something which
			activated that hatch and pulled
			the ship inside the sphere.
			A nice bit of reasoning, Lad...
			very nice indeed.
			We could trigger the hatch, but
			we'd probably be pulled in like
			they were.
			Maybe all we need to do is get
			our foot in the door.
			If we trigger the hatch with a
			subspace transmission, we might
			not be pulled inside if we keep
			our distance from the sphere --
			say a half million kilometers.
			Then, when the hatch starts to
			close again, we move in, and use
			the Jenolen to jam the hatch open
			and hope the Enterprise can
			escape.
			You can't be serious. That hatch
			is huge. It could crush this ship
			like an egg.
			The shields will hold Lad, don't
			you worry about that. I know how
			to get a few extra gigawatts out
			of these babies.
			Scotty. This is crazy. I am not
			going to let you---
			Geordi. I've spent my whole life
			figuring out how to make crazy
			things work.
			I'm telling you... one engineer
			to another... I can do this.
			All right. Let's do it.
			We're at five hundred thousand
			kilometers.
			Engines're ready.
			Okay. Here we go.
			Come on... there's nothing out
			here... give it up.
			I still can't open a channel to
			the Enterprise... there's too much
			interference. We'll have to to
			wait until we're right in the
			doorway.
			That's it. Let's go! Full
			impulse.
			Sir. There is an audio message
			from Commander La Forge.
			This is La Forge, do you read me,
			Enterprise?
			We read you, go ahead Commander.
			Understood.
			Set a course.
			The plasma intercooler's gone.
			The engines are overheating.
			I've lost helm control...
			La Forge to Enterprise. Captain,
			we won't be able to move this ship
			out of the way when you get
			here... you're going to have to
			destroy it in order to escape.
			How long will it take us to reach
			them?
			With impulse engines operating
			at sixty percent power, it will
			take one minute forty seconds.
			I can't hold her together much
			longer... we've got about two
			minutes before the engines go
			critical.
			Bridge to Transporter Room Three.
			Stand by to beam two from the
			Jenolen as soon as we're in range.
			Photon torpedoes loaded.
			It's coming apart, Lad. I can't
			do anything else.
			We are within transporter range.
			Bridge to Transporter Room.
			Energize.
			Fire torpedoes.
			There now. That wasn't so bad,
			was it?
			So, this alien space 'baby'--
			which was about the size of a
			four-story building -- really
			thought the Enterprise was its
			mother.
			You're pulling an old man's leg.
			No, really. It was 'suckling'
			power directly from the ship's
			fusion reactors... so Doctor
			Brahms and I changed the power
			frequency from twenty-one
			centimeters to point-oh-two
			centimeters...
			You soured the milk.
			That's right.
			Enjoy these times, Geordi. You're
			the chief engineer of a
			starship... it's a time of your
			life that'll never come again...
			and once it's gone... it's gone.
			I thought you were going to buy
			me a drink in Ten Forward.
			I have a better idea.
			You're giving me one of your
			shuttles?
			Call it... an extended loan.
			Since you lost your ship while
			saving ours, it seemed only fair.
			It's not much to look at...
			Lad, every woman has her own
			charms... ye just have to know
			where to look.
			It's a little slow, but it'll get
			you to the Norpin colony... if
			that's really where you want to
			go.
			The Norpin Colony is where old
			men go to retire... maybe I'll
			end up there someday... but not
			just yet.
			Bon voyage, Mister Scott.
			Thank you, sir. For everything.
			They're a good crew.
			Yeah.
			And she's a fine ship... a credit
			to her name.
			But I've always found that a ship
			is only as good as the Engineer
			who takes care of her... and from
			what I can see... the Enterprise
			is in good hands.
