			What?
			Alright, come in.
			Guinan... ? What are you doing
			here?
			I need a doctor.
			Geordi beat me in straight sets
			today.
			I think I've got a case of tennis
			elbow.
			Go to Sickbay. I think Doctor
			Selar is on duty.
			I don't want to see Selar. I
			always see you. I'm particular
			about my doctors.
			Well, you'd better get a new
			one... because I'm not a doctor
			on this ship anymore.
			Three days on the shuttle to
			Starbase twenty-three... then a
			transport back to Earth... I can
			hear Admiral Brooks now, telling
			me how I've disgraced Starfleet
			Medical...
			Then a leisurely day and a half
			before the formal inquiry begins
			and my career ends.
			Beverly.
			My elbow.
			Your elbow... ?
			Alright, let me see it...
			Does that hurt?
			Yeah, right there...
			Tennis elbow, alright. Hold it
			like this...
			I've never been to a formal
			inquiry.
			It's no big thing. Any doctor can
			have one... all you have to do is
			disobey orders... violate medical
			ethics... cause an interstellar
			incident...
			That would do it, all right.
			Make a fist.
			Do I have to break my leg before
			you tell me what happened?
			It started when I invited those
			scientists on board...
			No. It started at the Altine
			Consortium.
			Actually, it probably started
			before that. When I began
			feeling... comfortable.
			Comfortable?
			Too comfortable.
			Ah.
			That's why I went to the Altine
			Conference... to hear the latest
			bio-physical theories. Maybe find
			a new area of research. And
			that's where I met Doctor Reyga...
			nobody would listen to him -- just
			because he was a Ferengi. They
			all but jeered him off the
			stage...
			So you invited the scientists on
			board... to listen to this Doctor
			Reyga...
			I thought I could be a...
			facilitator. You see, he had this
			amazing invention, based on
			metaphasic field technology. But
			his methodology was completely
			unorthodox.
			That's my favorite kind.
			I thought... if I could bring
			scientists from various cultures
			aboard the Enterprise... sit them
			down... help them understand the
			value of his ideas... well, it
			seemed like the right thing to do.
			Sort of a scientific diplomat.
			That's it exactly. And believe
			me, it wasn't easy.
			I had to persuade Captain
			Picard... and then I had to round
			up as many scientists as I could
			in the field of subspace
			technology...
			... but of all the scientists I
			invited, only four were interested
			in hearing about Doctor Reyga's
			invention.
			Kurak was a warp field specialist
			on the Klingon Homeworld. I don't
			think Klingons regard scientists
			very highly... she always seemed
			a little defensive.
			Doctor T'Pan is practically a
			legend in the field of subspace
			morphology. She's been the
			director of the Vulcan Science
			Academy for fifteen years...
			Her husband, Doctor Christopher,
			came with her... I didn't know
			much about him... but he was some
			kind of a subspace theoretician.
			Jo'Bril was a Takaran... the first
			one I'd ever met. I had no idea
			what to expect from him.
			And then there was Doctor Reyga...
			the Ferengi scientist.
			You've all seen my experimental
			data. The metaphasic shield has
			been proven.
			Forgive my skepticism, Doctor, but
			your claims are somewhat
			extravagant. Protect a shuttle
			within a star's corona? Not even
			your own government believes it
			can be done.
			That's why I've asked you all to
			come here. I think you have the
			vision to see the potential in
			Doctor Reyga's metaphasic shield.
			I need help to develop the shield.
			I am willing to grant exclusive
			rights to whoever provides the
			necessary resources.
			I think you all realize what this
			shielding process would mean...
			the possibilities for exploration
			and research are endless...
			But only if it works.
			I'm not convinced this metaphasic
			shield can withstand either the
			temperature or the radiation it
			would be exposed to.
			But it has -- not only in
			countless simulations, but in a
			field test that I conducted
			myself.
			For which, of course, we have only
			your word...
			Are you accusing me of falsifying
			my data?
			You wouldn't be the first
			scientist to manipulate
			experimental data to his own
			advantage...
			Doctor Reyga has offered to
			demonstrate his invention. He's
			outfitted one of our shuttles with
			the metaphasic shield.
			I will take it into the corona of
			the star Vaytan.
			That star has a superdense corona.
			The shuttle would be subjected to
			particularly intense radiation.
			Perhaps it would be wise to choose
			a star of lesser magnitude.
			I agree. My own research into
			solar energy transfer suggests
			that Vaytan's corona is extremely
			unstable.
			What better way to test my
			invention? I'm not concerned --
			the shield will hold.
			I, for one, would feel more
			comfortable if someone else flew
			the shuttle. Someone more --
			objective.
			I will volunteer for that task.
			I've spent years studying solar
			plasma reactions. The thought of
			being able to penetrate a star's
			corona... it's a remarkable
			opportunity.
			I've studied your data. I think
			you're on solid scientific ground.
			I don't share your optimism,
			Doctor Jo'Bril... but if you wish
			to pilot the craft, I would be
			more confident about your
			assessment of the shield... than
			Doctor Reyga's.
			I agree. At this point, we need
			an impartial evaluation.
			We'd want to be sure that you're
			familiar with the shuttle
			controls... and Doctor Reyga's
			modifications...
			I'm an accomplished pilot. It
			will be no problem.
			Well...
			What do you think?
			Doctor Jo'Bril... I am gratified.
			And there will be no difficulty
			operating the metaphasic controls --
			the system will activate
			automatically as you approach the
			star.
			Well, then. We'll proceed with
			the demonstration at fifteen
			hundred hours. We'll meet on the
			Bridge.
			I think that went well, don't you?
			Thanks to you, Doctor.
			I didn't do anything...
			This is an opportunity I would
			never have had without you, and I
			promise you I'll never forget it.
			Some of those scientists are still
			a little doubtful... but after the
			demonstration I'm sure they'll
			come around.
			If there's anything I'm used to --
			it's skepticism.
			After all -- a Ferengi scientist
			is almost a contradiction in
			terms.
			No, don't deny it. I know how the
			Ferengi are regarded...
			I'd still expect the scientific
			community to be more open-minded
			than they seem to be.
			The metaphasic shield is a
			breakthrough in technology... many
			scientists have tried to develop
			it. It's only natural there would
			be some... resistance...
			You mean jealousy.
			I know. I wondered if that might
			account for Doctor T'Pan's
			attitude. She's been working on
			subspace shielding technology for
			years. And you've beaten her to
			the punch.
			I'm really not interested in
			competition. All I want is to be
			acknowledged... respected as a
			scientist. This invention will
			finally do that.
			As far as I was concerned, the
			hard part was over. I'd stepped
			out on a limb... and it hadn't
			broken.
			Not bad for my first venture into
			scientific diplomacy.
			Captain, the shuttle has been
			launched.
			On screen. Open a channel.
			I'm one million kilometers from
			the star's corona... proceeding at
			three quarters impulse... I should
			reach it in approximately three
			minutes.
			The metaphasic shielding has begun
			to form.
			External temperature is zero-pointnine
			million Kelvins and rising.
			Radiation levels are nearing ten
			thousand rads.
			That should have no effect on the
			shuttle cabin...
			That's right. Cabin temperature
			is twenty-one degrees celcius.
			Radiation levels are normal.
			Wait -- I'm reading elevated
			neutriono levels in the cabin...
			Those are from the subspace field
			that's encapsulating the shuttle.
			The levels are well within
			acceptable parameters.
			Outside temperature is rising
			rapidly -- one-point-seven million
			Kelvins.
			Cabin temperature is still twenty-one
			degrees. The shield is
			holding...
			I'm nearing the corona... Three
			hundred fifty thousand kilometers
			and closing... this is
			incredible... I'm actually flying
			into a star...
			Congratulations, Doctor. This is
			an amazing achievement.
			Radiation levels outside the
			shuttle are nearing fourteen
			thousand rads.
			But they're normal inside the
			cabin.
			I'm now fully engulfed in the
			corona... it's astonishing...
			You see, Doctors? Metaphasic
			shielding is a reality.
			Doctor Jo'Bril, can you give us an
			estimate of the plasma turbulence?
			Doctor Jo'Bril... ?
			Something's wrong.
			Mister Data, what's going on?
			Sensors indicate an increased
			level of baryon particles in the
			cabin.
			No... that's not possible...
			Doctor Jo'Bril, can you hear us?
			Please respond.
			Baryon levels are continuing to
			rise...
			I don't understand it... this
			shouldn't be happening...
			Mister Worf, can we beam him out
			of there?
			The solar radiation is
			interfering... he must be at
			least five-hundred thousand
			kilometers from the star before we
			can get a Transporter lock.
			Doctor Jo'Bril... listen to me.
			It is imperative that you turn the
			shuttle... take it out of the
			corona...
			Do you understand what I'm saying?
			Pilot the shuttle away from the
			star...
			We're losing him...
			The shuttle is emerging from the
			corona, sir.
			Get a lock on him as soon as you
			can, Mister Worf.
			Beam him directly to Sickbay.
			Twenty cc's inoprovaline...
			That's not doing it. Cortical
			stimulators.
			Again.
			I saw... the sun...
			So that was my first experience as
			a scientific diplomat.
			A complete failure. I don't think
			I've ever felt so awful.
			I don't understand it.
			No?
			I mean... I've lost people
			before... patients...
			But this was different.
			Yes. But I don't know why.
			If I had to hazard a guess... I'd
			say that when you're dealing with
			a patient... you feel like you're
			in control.
			I guess so...
			Your training, your experience...
			it's all there, at your
			fingertips. So even if you
			fail... you know you've done the
			best you can do.
			But once you send someone on a
			dangerous mission... all you can
			do is watch.
			I felt... helpless...
			Don't you think anyone would have?
			Maybe you're being a little hard
			on yourself.
			But Guinan... that wasn't the end.
			You don't know the half of it.
			How's it going?
			I've never run into a humanoid
			species like this...
			His internal physiology is
			baffling. He doesn't seem to have
			discrete "organs"... at least not
			in the traditional sense...
			practically every system is evenly
			distributed throughout his body.
			That kind of physiology should
			make him incredibly resistant to
			injury... so whatever killed him
			had to occur at the cellular
			level...
			Do you have any idea what it was?
			No. Something caused a massive,
			system-wide failure... but I don't
			know what.
			Were the solar radiation levels
			high enough to have killed him?
			His exposure to the star's
			radiation was minimal. It's all
			very strange...
			Doctor, here's the result of the
			tissue scan you asked for.
			That's odd... his rate of cellular
			decay is extremely low...
			The answers will come, Beverly...
			Maybe even minimal exposure to
			radiation altered his physiology
			at the cellular level...
			You've been at this for hours...
			You might think more clearly if
			you get a good night's sleep.
			I couldn't close my eyes. I have
			to find out what killed him. I
			owe that to Doctor Reyga.
			Are you doing it for Reyga... or
			yourself?
			What do you mean?
			You're the loneliest person in the
			world right now... no one can say
			anything... no one can do anything
			that will help. You don't think
			it'll ever go away.
			And you're right. It never does.
			But you can live with it. It
			doesn't feel that way now, but you
			can.
			At the time, I was too preoccupied
			with my problems to understand
			what he was saying. I wasn't
			thinking about the rest of my
			life... I was trying to make sense
			of what had happened...
			Run another diagnostic on the EPS
			flow regulator.
			The flow regulator is functioning
			properly.
			What about the field emitter coil?
			Has it maintained polarity?
			Yes, Doctor.
			The radial force compensator?
			I am unable to locate any
			malfunction. All of your systems
			are operating according to your
			design specifications.
			You didn't find anything wrong?
			I don't understand it. There must
			be something we've overlooked...
			I found some micro-crystalline
			damage to the hull which confirms
			that your shield was breached by
			a burst of baryonic radiation...
			Were the levels high enough to
			damage organic tissue?
			I don't know.
			Perhaps there was an unexpected
			interaction between the solar
			radiation and your metaphasic
			shield.
			No, that's not possible... I
			anticipated every contingency.
			Then Jo'Bril must've run into
			something in the corona which you
			didn't anticipate... and your
			shield just wasn't able to protect
			him from it.
			Reyga was angry... but I knew it
			was because he was so
			disappointed. Everything he'd
			worked for... hoped for... was
			slipping away...
			... and that made what I had to do
			next even harder.
			I'm sure you can all understand
			that in light of what's
			happened... it would be
			inappropriate to continue with the
			project.
			Perhaps when Doctor Reyga has
			perfected his metaphasic
			technology, we can try again.
			Doctor Crusher... please... if I
			could have a little more time to
			investigate... I'm sure I could
			find what went wrong.
			But that won't bring back Jo'Bril,
			will it?
			I do not believe the shield will
			ever work. Its very concept is
			flawed.
			Just one more test...
			Whom do you propose to sacrifice
			next?
			I will pilot the shuttle myself.
			I'm sorry. But as Chief Medical
			Officer, I'm responsible for the
			health and safety of the people
			aboard.
			And I will not authorize any
			further tests.
			Very well.
			But I will prove myself.
			I couldn't help but admire his
			tenacity. He just wasn't going to
			accept defeat. And I hoped he
			would prove himself.
			But that was the last time I saw
			him alive.
			We'd gone to Science Lab Four when
			the ship's sensors registered a
			sizeable plasma surge there...
			A plasma infuser... it's been
			completely discharged. The blast
			must have killed him instantly.
			Perhaps he could not live with the
			failure of his invention, and took
			his own life.
			Or perhaps someone just wants it
			to look that way.
			Look at this... isn't it odd that
			he could hold on so tightly to the
			infuser when it was discharged.
			The normal reflex would be to drop
			it.
			The plasma shock could have
			affected his nervous system. He
			may have reacted by gripping
			tighter.
			I'll know for certain when I do
			the autopsy.
			Is your examination complete,
			Doctor?
			For now. You can transfer the
			body to the Morgue.
			Very well.
			I remembered his passion... and
			commitment... and his
			determination to prove himself.
			And I was sure that this man had
			not taken his own life.
			Jean-Luc, I was with him right
			before he died. He was not
			suicidal.
			I respect your instincts, of
			course... but by your own
			admission, Reyga was not an easy
			man to understand. Isn't it
			possible that he was simply
			masking his feelings?
			I don't think so. He was
			disappointed at the failure of his
			device... and upset by Jo'Bril's
			death... but there was no sense
			that he was ready to take his own
			life.
			I'm sure it's difficult for you to
			accept. You championed him... you
			believed in his invention...
			This isn't about my feelings --
			I'm saying that Reyga didn't kill
			himself... and if that's true,
			someone else did it.
			Beverly... I know what you're
			going through. I know what it's
			like to feel -- responsible for a
			tragedy. I know the temptation to
			look for anything that would
			remove some of that culpability...
			I know I can't expect you to
			accept what I'm saying without
			evidence. When I've finished the
			autopsy, I hope I'll have it.
			I'm afraid there won't be an
			autopsy.
			The family has already been
			contacted... they insist the body
			must not be touched before they
			perform the Ferengi death rituals.
			But... there's a question about
			the circumstances of his death --
			To the family, that is irrelevant.
			Maybe if I talked to them...
			I promise you -- they are adamant.
			We're scheduled to rendezvous with
			a Ferengi ship in seventeen hours.
			They will be picking up Reyga's
			body then.
			I'm sorry. But there will be no
			autopsy.
			I can't just let it drop... don't
			you see -- ? There might have
			been a murder.
			If you can find evidence of
			that... in some way other than an
			autopsy... I'll consider it.
			I don't understand, Doctor. Isn't
			it pretty clear that Reyga died
			from a plasma discharge?
			It's not clear without an autopsy.
			For all I know, he might have been
			poisoned... and the plasma infuser
			put in his hand after he died.
			You think he was murdered?
			I'm not discounting that
			possibility. The point is,
			without a complete autopsy,
			there's no way to know for
			certain.
			Why won't the Ferengi allow it?
			It has to do with their death
			rituals. The body can't be
			violated before it's buried...
			And apparently the family is more
			concerned with ritual than with
			finding out the truth about his
			death.
			I just can't get the information
			I need from a tricorder scan...
			Suspects.
			If Reyga didn't kill himself...
			someone else did. So who are the
			possible suspects?
			Whoever had something to gain from
			his death...
			And the only ones I see that fit
			that category -- are the other
			scientists.
			I'm afraid I don't understand,
			Doctor. Do you have evidence that
			Reyga was murdered?
			No. But I just can't accept the
			fact that he took his own life...
			and I want to explore the
			possibilities a bit further.
			What reason would anyone have had
			to kill him?
			That's why I came to you. I
			wondered if you might have any
			thoughts along that line...
			I'm not sure what you mean.
			I'm not sure, either. Just...
			anything you might have heard, or
			observed... that might provide a
			clue...
			Just as an example... if his
			technology had been successful,
			you might have been displaced as
			the preeminent scientist in
			subspace technology. That might
			seem like a motive. Of course, it
			wasn't successful...
			I understand your point, Doctor.
			And I don't know of anything like
			that.
			I must say I resent this, Doctor.
			We've all been shocked by the
			recent events. I don't see that
			there's anything to gain by
			dragging us through these
			insinuations.
			I'm just trying to uncover the
			truth. And I'm asking your help
			to do it. Have you seen or heard
			anything that might suggest that
			someone else had a motive?
			We'd like to forget the
			unpleasantness of the last several
			days... not have it stirred up
			again. I find it disturbing that
			you would try to foster suspicions
			among us...
			Forgive me... but I get the
			feeling you're protesting a little
			too vehemently...
			I find your question distasteful.
			Is there something you're not
			telling me?
			I'm sure it's nothing...
			I was in the storage room of the
			science laboratory yesterday...
			Kurak was working in the lab. I
			heard Reyga come in... they got
			into... an argument.
			About what?
			I don't know... I couldn't hear
			clearly until they started
			shouting at each other.
			Then I heard Kurak say that Reyga
			had questioned her honor, and no
			Klingon would stand for that.
			But I do not believe she killed
			him. They were words spoken in
			the heat of anger. Kurak is
			volatile... passionate... but not
			a killer.
			And, Doctor -- neither are we.
			I knew he might be right about
			Kurak... Klingons make threats as
			a matter of course. On the other
			hand... sometimes they follow
			through.
			That looks like one of Doctor
			Reyga's shield configurations.
			Yes.
			Personal research.
			You seem very interested in
			technology that failed.
			No one has denied there is
			potential in the idea.
			Which you're now free to
			develop...
			Are you accusing me of something?
			No... but I want to know why you
			threatened Reyga.
			I warned him that if he persisted
			with his slander he would pay the
			price.
			What did he accuse you of?
			I will not repeat his lies.
			Were they lies?
			Be careful, Doctor. Insulting the
			honor of a Klingon can be
			extremely dangerous.
			Did Reyga make that mistake?
			I have heard enough accusations.
			Now, I will have your silence.
			You're going to have to throw me
			a lot harder than that to get it.
			Now. What did he accuse you of?
			Sabotage.
			Sabotage... of the metaphasic
			shield... was that why it failed?
			How would I know?
			Did you sabotage the project?
			No. I did not.
			Good-bye, Doctor.
			I was beginning to find out that
			investigating a murder was a
			little more perilous than I'd
			thought. And I really didn't have
			any more insight than I did before
			I started.
			Which brought me back to Reyga's
			body... because the more I thought
			about it...
			... the more it seemed that the
			answers had to be there.
			DNA traces... tissue anomalies...
			a wealth of forensic clues that
			could shed some light on this
			mystery.
			So... I made the decision.
			Come.
			Beverly. What can I do for you?
			Jean-Luc. I'm going to tell you
			something you need to know. You
			won't like it.
			I just did an autopsy on Doctor
			Reyga.
			And what did you find?
			Nothing.
			I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't
			have done it.
			You most certainly should not. I
			made it clear to you that the
			family expressly prohibited it.
			You have not only disobeyed my
			order, you have interfered in the
			death rituals of another culture.
			I know.
			You've put both of us in a very
			difficult position.
			The family will have to be
			notified. And I have no doubt
			that they will react strongly.
			If the Ferengi government gets
			into it... and I'm certain they
			will... there might be some
			significant repercussions.
			I'm not sure how much I could
			protect you.
			You don't have to, Jean-Luc. I
			knew what I was doing. I'm
			prepared to accept the
			consequences.
			I could tell that he was terribly
			disappointed in me... and that was
			almost the hardest part of all...
			Anyway... the Ferengi lodged a
			formal complaint with Starfleet
			Command, and the Captain was
			ordered to relieve me of duty.
			So.... that's the story. That's
			how I managed to end my career.
			Backhand volley.
			What?
			That's how I did it. Geordi kept
			hitting to my backhand at the
			net...
			Guinan... have you been listening
			to me?
			I've heard every word you said.
			And this is the response I get?
			Two people have died on this
			ship... two lives that ended,
			horribly... and you're worried
			about your tennis game?
			Doctor... are you angry?
			Angry? For two hours, I've poured
			my heart out to you... and all you
			care about is your elbow. You bet
			I'm angry!
			Then what are you going to do
			about it?
			Do... ?
			For two hours you've been moping
			around, feeling sorry for
			yourself...
			If you're angry -- maybe you'll
			stop moping and do something.
			I've already tried everything I
			could think of, and it's only made
			things worse.
			Do you think Reyga killed himself?
			No.
			Do you think there's a murderer on
			the Enterprise?
			Yes.
			Then why are you standing here?
			I'm in enough trouble already. If
			I start digging into this again --
			That's right. You could be
			relieved of duty.
			Data... what are you doing here?
			I am running additional
			diagnostics to make certain there
			was no permanent radiation damage
			to the shuttlecraft hull.
			Data, you've studied Doctor
			Reyga's shield system. Tell me --
			do you think it could've been
			sabotaged?
			There was no evidence to suggest
			sabotage.
			Just consider the possibility...
			The system interlocks prevent
			access to the circuitry unless the
			shield emitter is active. Any
			attempt to sabotage the device
			would have to be made while the
			shield was in operation.
			The only time the shield was
			active was during Jo'Bril's test
			flight.
			That is correct. It seems
			unlikely that Jo'Bril would
			perform sabotage which would
			result in his own death.
			I agree.
			Would it be possible to sabotage
			the shuttle by remote, during the
			flight?
			A phased ionic pulse beamed
			directly into the metaphasic
			projection matrix would cause a
			temporary system malfunction.
			Where on the Enterprise could you
			generate a phased ionic pulse?
			Such a pulse could be initiated
			from the lateral sensor arrays,
			Science Labs one, four, or
			sixteen, or any of the bridge
			science stations.
			Let's assume for the moment that
			someone did send out a phased
			ionic pulse... what would've
			happened inside the shuttle?
			A tetryon field would have formed
			briefly inside the cabin,
			temporarily disrupting the
			metaphasic shield.
			A tetryon field... If Jo'Bril had
			been exposed to a tetryon field,
			it might have left residual traces
			in his tissue...
			Thanks, Data.
			Beverly...
			Yes?
			We've made arrangements for a
			shuttle to Starbase twenty-three.
			You can leave at oh-seven-hundred
			hours tomorrow.
			Thank you.
			I'm sorry about all this... I'm
			sure it will all work out fine.
			Of course.
			The inquiry is only a formality...
			you know the Captain will support
			you all he can.
			That will help.
			But... if you do anything...
			foolish... before the inquiry...
			that wouldn't look so good.
			I don't know what you're talking
			about. What you mean...
			I think you do. The smartest
			thing you can do right now is to
			stay in your quarters and read a
			good book. Because if you make
			this situation any worse -- it'll
			be that much harder on you.
			Thank you, Commander. Your
			concern is noted --
			Beverly... I'm saying this as a
			friend.
			I know, Wil... thank you.
			But... as a friend... please try
			to understand. I can't quit now.
			And I don't want you to get
			involved...
			Computer, access ship's medical
			logs and download current autopsy
			files.
			Autopsy files are restricted to
			active medical personnel only.
			Access denied.
			Doctor Crusher... ?
			Ogawa.
			What do you need the autopsy files
			for?
			Don't worry. I know I'm not
			supposed to be here... I'll go...
			Computer, access autopsy files...
			I assume you want the files on
			Doctor Reyga and Jo'Brill...
			Alissa...
			I can see how important this is to
			you...
			I don't want you to get
			involved...
			Is that an order, Doctor?
			Yes.
			Too bad you're not my boss any
			more.
			Thank you.
			So what do we need to do?
			First, I want to review Jo'Bril's
			physiology records... and then I
			want to take another look at his
			body. I need to see if there's
			any evidence of tetryon traces.
			Let's do it.
			We'll have to run a tissue scan at
			the molecular level. Calibrate
			the scanner to detect tetryon
			particles.
			Yes, Doctor.
			Re-calibration complete.
			Okay. Activate the scan.
			Nothing...
			Let's try it again. Use the
			enhanced resolution mode to boost
			the sensitivity.
			Look... in the subdermal tissue...
			tetryon traces...
			So someone did sabotage the
			shield...
			That's a possibility... but this
			is very circumstantial evidence.
			There's one way to be certain...
			Captain, I'm a little concerned
			about Beverly. I've tried several
			times to talk to her, but she
			keeps avoiding me.
			I'm not surprised.
			I'm afraid this entire experience
			has --
			Captain, there has been an
			unscheduled launch from Shuttlebay
			Two.
			I have no idea... no one's filed
			a flight plan...
			On screen.
			That's the Justman... the shuttle
			Reyga modified...
			Open a hailing frequency.
			Beverly... what do you think
			you're doing?
			Testing a theory, Captain.
			A theory?
			I think Reyga's shield does work.
			Return to the ship immediately.
			I'm sorry.
			Mister Worf -- override the
			shuttle's computer. Return it to
			the shuttlebay.
			Aye, sir.
			Sir, she has isolated her
			navigational control... it will
			not be possible to establish
			remote operation.
			Get a tractor beam on her.
			I cannot establish a lock, she is
			too close to the star... solar
			interference is too high.
			Mister Data, what's her heading?
			Bearing two-seven-one mark four.
			She is heading into the sun's
			corona.
			Computer -- begin monitoring
			external temperature.
			External temperature zero-point-eight
			million Kelvins and
			rising...
			Beverly. What do you hope to
			accomplish?
			Doctor Reyga was right about his
			shield. The only reason it failed
			was because it was sabotaged...
			and I'm going to prove it.
			You can't be certain of that.
			You're betting your life on a
			hypothesis.
			I'm not wrong.
			External temperature one-point-nine
			million Kelvins...
			Sir, the shuttle is entering the
			corona.
			Beverly -- what's happening?
			I'm all right...
			Computer -- shield status?
			Metaphasic shield holding... all
			systems within normal operating
			parameters.
			Congratulations, Doctor Reyga...
			you did it.
			Captain, I want you to post
			security guards on the three
			visiting scientists... one of them
			has to be responsible for
			sabotaging the first test... I
			think if we --
			Sir, we've lost contact.
			Enterprise? I've lost you, come
			in...
			They cannot hear you.
			I've severed communications.
			How... can you be alive... ?
			I'd think after your autopsy on
			me, you'd know the answer to that.
			The slow rate of cellular decay...
			It's a natural result of physio-stasis.
			Takarans can control
			their physiology at a cellular
			level. We can create the
			appearance of death...
			In the morgue... you were
			conscious the whole time... you
			heard everything we said... knew
			everything we were going to do...
			Move away.
			What are you doing?
			I'm sending out a transient
			subspace signal. It will obscure
			the shuttle from the Enterprise
			sensors... and they will interpret
			it as a warp engine breach.
			They'll believe that you've been
			destroyed.
			I'd like to thank you, Doctor.
			For what?
			All I wanted to do was discredit
			Reyga so no one would pursue his
			technology except me. But you've
			given me more than I could've
			hoped...
			Now I can take the prototype back
			to Takara... where I will develop
			it into a weapon.
			All I have to do is wait here
			until the Enterprise is convinced
			you're dead... and leaves.
			Warning. Approaching stellar
			photosphere... Metaphasic shield
			at seventy-one percent...
			... Metaphasic shield at fifty-nine
			percent....
			Metaphasic shield at thirty-four
			percent.
			Metaphasic shield at twenty-one
			percent. Hull failure imminent.
			There is no indication of any
			debris, sir... but the subspace
			signal indicates a warp engine
			breach.
			All right... begin a phase-one
			search, starting on the last known
			coordinates of the shuttlecraft...
			Ensign, plot a proximity course to --
			Sir, we are picking up an object
			emerging from the corona.
			Crusher to Enterprise...
			... I'm all right... returning to
			the ship...
			Chief Medical Officer's log,
			Stardate 46831.2. I have been
			reinstated and will be resuming my
			duties shortly. In the meantime,
			I have a personal matter to attend
			to.
			Hello, Guinan.
			Somebody's birthday?
			Not unless it's yours.
			This is for you.
			For me? What's the occasion?
			It's a thank you. For giving me
			a good kick in the butt.
			But... I didn't.
			I did a little research... this is
			the latest design... state of the
			art... and it's specially
			cushioned to absorb vibration --
			so you'll never have to worry
			about tennis elbow again.
			Thank you, Doctor... it looks like
			a great racquet. But you see...
			I don't play tennis. Never have.
			I, for one, came here only at the
			request of my government. I am
			highly dubious that this so-called
			metaphasic shield technology will
			prove anything but a fantasy.
			Since everything Doctor Reyga says
			contradicts the work I have been
			doing in subspace shielding, I
			will have to be convinced that he
			is credible.
			My wife is right. We feel the
			concept itself is flawed. But we
			will admit to a kind of curiosity
			about it.
