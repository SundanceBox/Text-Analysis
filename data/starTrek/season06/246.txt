			Captain's log, Stardate 46731.5.
			We are in the midst of the
			Volterra nebula, a stellar
			"nursery." Our three week mission
			is a routine analysis of several
			dozen protostars in various stages
			of development.
			Captain, I have completed the
			spectral evaluation of the outer
			shell.
			Our survey of this protostar is
			complete.
			Ensign, lay in a course to the
			next one, three quarters impulse.
			Riker to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Number One?
			May I see you in the Observation
			Lounge, Sir?
			Of course. I'll be right there.
			My God...
			Then you can identify this object,
			Mister Picard.
			Professor Galen.
			I suppose I should say -- Captain
			Picard.
			Professor Galen hailed me from his
			shuttle an hour ago. He suggested
			that we surprise you.
			To clarify... I insisted and your
			First Officer was kind enough to
			accommodate me. I hope I haven't
			been overly presumptuous...
			My star pupil now being master of
			the stars...
			No one is more welcome on my ship.
			I never thought I would see a
			Kurlan naiskos.
			Fifth Dynasty?
			Is that your conclusion, Mister
			Picard.
			Forgive me again, Captain.
			Please. "Mister" will do just
			fine.
			The overall configuration is
			certainly Fifth Dynasty. But the
			surface ornamentation...
			Yes...
			Green polychrome over the eyes...
			And the eyes themselves... open.
			Third Dynasty. From the workshop
			of the Master of Tarquin Hill.
			Well done.
			The Master of Tarquin Hill created
			ceramic designs that were three
			centuries ahead of his time. We
			only know him by his work -- his
			name has never been discovered...
			This object is over twelve
			thousand years old...
			The planet Kurl? That's a hell of
			a long way outside Federation
			territory.
			Indeed. I thought you had
			completed your studies of Kurlan
			artifacts some time ago.
			I happened to be in the
			neighborhood last summer. I
			couldn't resist.
			Go ahead.
			It's complete?
			The Kurl believed every individual
			is a community of individuals.
			Inside us are many voices, each
			with its own desires, its own
			style, its own way of viewing the
			world.
			But Kurlan civilization died out
			thousands of years ago. It's rare
			to find a figurine intact.
			A truly incredible find.
			It's yours, Jean-Luc.
			How could I accept this --
			... Graciously, Mister Picard. You
			could accept it graciously.
			How long can you stay? There's so
			much to talk about.
			The Professor is scheduled to meet
			a Vulcan transport the day after
			tomorrow.
			Two days? That's not nearly
			enough time...
			We may have considerably more than
			that.
			I don't understand.
			I am currently on an expedition.
			A journey into unexplored
			historical territory.
			And I intend to take you with me.
			Captain's log, supplemental. It
			has been over thirty years since
			I last saw my archaeology
			professor. His presence has taken
			me back to a time when I had
			considered a very different
			career...
			I read your paper on the Kea Four
			excavation that you delivered at
			last year's symposium. It was...
			informative.
			Damning with faint praise.
			One can hardly serve two masters.
			For a Starfleet Captain at the
			helm of the Federation flagship...
			attendance alone would have been
			impressive enough. But you still
			managed to present a piece of
			original research.
			A small piece, granted.
			Nevertheless, I admire your
			tenacity.
			I had hoped to see you there. You
			said in your last letter that you
			might go.
			Much too busy, I'm afraid. I was
			on the far side of the Aolian
			Cluster at the time.
			Professor Galen, may I ask a frank
			question?
			Please.
			Your published writings have
			been... sporadic over the last
			ten years or so. Your appearances
			at symposia have been rare -- or
			scheduled and then cancelled at
			the last minute. The finest
			archaeologist of the century has
			become shrouded with an air of
			mystery.
			And my reputation as a result has
			no doubt grown.
			I've yet to run across anyone that
			didn't love a good mystery.
			The Sataaran of Sothis Three
			disdain them.
			Nevertheless, as a general
			principle, your statement holds.
			Professor, what have you been
			doing for the last decade?
			Are you familiar with
			micropaleontology?
			Studying fossil records at a
			microscopic level. I remember
			reading your papers on the
			subject. But that was years
			ago... Then your work seemed to
			stop.
			No. The work continued.
			I made a discovery so profound in
			its implications that silence
			seemed the wisest course.
			This... work has occupied my every
			waking thought, it's intruded upon
			my dreams. It's become my life.
			And when it's finished, when I
			announce my findings...
			It will be heard half-way across
			the galaxy.
			Tell me --
			... I'm sorry, Mister Picard. But
			that information has a price --
			your agreement to join me on the
			final leg of this expedition.
			For how long?
			Three months. Perhaps a year. If
			we had a starship and complete
			diplomatic access -- a matter of
			weeks. But we'll have only my
			shuttle, the transports we can
			arrange, and our combined talents.
			Why can't you do this without me?
			I'm not a young man. There will
			be hazards along the way. I don't
			want my own inadequacies to
			jeopardize the completion of this
			work.
			Professor, I'm honored that you'd
			think of me. But I have a
			responsibility --
			... to History. What if you could
			have helped Schliemann discover
			the City of Troy? Or if you had
			been with M'Tell as she stepped
			upon Ya'Seem for the first time?
			How could anything compare?
			May I sleep on it?
			Dream not of today, Mister Picard.
			"Dream not of today." The night
			blessing of the Yash-El.
			As I recall, you missed that
			question on the final exam.
			I've had a few years to look it
			up.
			The Enterprise is yours, for as
			long as you're here.
			Dream not of today, Professor.
			Come.
			Good morning.
			You look like you've been up for
			awhile.
			Yes.
			One tea, Earl Grey, hot. One
			macchiato.
			Let's hear it...
			I had a long talk with Professor
			Galen last night. He asked me to
			leave the Enterprise -- to join
			him on an archaeological
			expedition that could last a year.
			Jean-Luc... that must be tempting.
			I wouldn't leave the Enterprise.
			But the offer itself has made me
			feel a certain... regret.
			That you could have been an
			archaeologist instead of a
			starship Captain?
			Not exactly. I'm certainly not
			sorry about the path I've taken...
			But... there's a certain...
			passion that comes with the
			singleminded pursuit of the past.
			To be captured by an image created
			by another's hand, hundreds or
			thousands of years ago. A being
			long dead, who still speaks to you
			through that image, who says "I
			was alive, as you are alive."
			I've only approximated that
			feeling. Professor Galen made it
			his life.
			The Professor didn't choose this
			figure at random -- the many
			voices inside the one. He knows
			that the past is one of the most
			insistent voices inside me. This
			gift was meant to remind me of
			that.
			And the exploration of space?
			Surely that counts for
			something...
			I wouldn't trade it for anything.
			And I'd still make the same
			decision I made all those years
			ago.
			I'm just sorry I have to say no to
			him a second time.
			You two were very close, weren't
			you?
			I had a father. But Professor
			Galen was like a father who
			understood me. And he had
			children -- but none followed in
			his footsteps. So, I was like the
			son who understood him.
			I guess it was difficult for both
			of you when you left.
			The Professor is somewhat...
			internal. He doesn't express
			feelings easily. But it was
			difficult for me.
			In some ways, I wish he'd never
			come on board.
			Good morning, Mister Picard.
			Professor.
			The Vulcan ship can take us as far
			as DS-Four. An Al-Leyan transport
			is scheduled to arrive at the
			station three weeks later.
			They'll take us as far as Caere
			and we can use the shuttle to get
			to Indri Eight. Our first stop.
			I'm afraid I won't be going.
			The Enterprise isn't something I
			can leave and then come back to.
			If I go, I go for good. I'm not
			prepared to do that.
			This isn't some undergraduate
			study project you're turning down.
			This is the chance of a lifetime.
			Don't make the same mistake twice.
			You can't believe that my career
			in Starfleet has been a mistake.
			What are you doing at this very
			moment? A "survey mission."
			You're like a Roman centurion off
			patrolling the provinces -- the
			maintenance of a dull and bloated
			Empire.
			We both know that isn't true.
			I know this. As a scholar, you're
			nothing but a dilettante.
			Years ago, I offered you the
			chance to become the finest
			archaeologist of your generation.
			Your achievements could have
			surpassed even my own.
			But you decided to turn your back
			on a life of profound discovery.
			And you turned your back on me.
			I never wanted --
			Will you come with me?
			I can't.
			Then I'll be going.
			You aren't scheduled to rendezvous
			with the Vulcan ship for two
			days...
			There's nothing else for me here.
			Goodbye, Captain.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. We
			have completed our mission in the
			nebula and are en route to a
			diplomatic conference on Atalia
			Seven. I must admit that I have
			lost my enthusiasm for those
			proceedings.
			At present speed, we will arrive
			at the Atalia system in thirty-seven
			hours.
			Captain, I'm going for a walk in
			the arboretum. I wouldn't mind
			some company.
			Captain! A distress call from
			Professor Galen's shuttle.
			Onscreen.
			Enterprise! I'm being boarded --
			Transmission has been blocked.
			Locate the call's origin and set
			course, warp eight.
			I have located the shuttle. It is
			under attack, Captain.
			Take us out of warp. On screen.
			A Yridian destroyer.
			Battle stations.
			Aye.
			Professor Galen is still inside
			his vessel.
			His vital signs are barely
			registering.
			Get him out of there.
			The shuttle is within a tractor
			beam -- the Transporter cannot
			penetrate it.
			Hail the Yridians.
			They are not responding.
			Return phaser fire, disable their
			offensive systems.
			Worf?
			I don't understand, Commander.
			The phaser blast was not powerful
			enough to destroy the ship.
			The Yridian vessel was overloading
			its power generators. That,
			combined with the phaser blast,
			caused it to explode.
			Transporter Room One, lock onto
			Professor Galen and transport him
			directly to Sickbay...
			He took a disruptor hit point
			blank. There's nothing I can do.
			Jean-Luc... I was... too harsh...
			I'd say at least three Yridians
			boarded the Professor's shuttle.
			What were they after?
			We're not sure, but it looked like
			they were trying to download
			something from his computer.
			When he was attacked, Professor
			Galen began to protect certain
			files in his computer memory.
			We were able to do a partial
			(TECH)-reconstruction on the
			shuttle computer, so we have at
			least some of those files.
			We found nineteen different blocks
			of numbers like this one.
			What do they mean?
			They could mean almost anything.
			Unless we can narrow the
			parameters of the search, it would
			be impossible for the computer to
			identify the patterns with any
			accuracy.
			We tried every decryption key on
			record -- in case Professor Galen
			was using some kind of code.
			We still can't make heads or tails
			of them.
			Were the Yridians able to get
			these number blocks?
			At least some of them. It's hard
			to say how many.
			Apparently, the Yridians knew more
			about the Professor's work than we
			do.
			They may have known what these
			numbers mean.
			If they did, that knowledge died
			with them.
			Not necessarily. The Yridians are
			information dealers. They could
			have been delivering the number
			blocks to someone else. Did they
			send any signals before they were
			destroyed?
			We detected no transmissions.
			There weren't any vessels in the
			immediate area.
			Do the shuttle's flight logs show
			where Galen had been before coming
			on board the Enterprise?
			The logs indicate that Professor
			Galen visited an unexplored star
			system -- Ruah Four.
			What's the distance from our
			current position?
			Four days at warp six.
			The conference can wait.
			Lay in a course to the Ruah
			system.
			Standard orbit, Ensign.
			Ruah Four is an M class planet.
			Sixty-seven percent of the surface
			is covered with water. The landmass
			contains multiple animal
			species, including a genus of
			proto-hominids.
			Scan for any evidence of monuments
			or earth works which might suggest
			an ancient civilization.
			There is nothing to indicate
			former occupancy by even a
			primitive culture, sir.
			Then what was the most renowned
			archaeologist in the Federation
			doing here?
			When he left the Enterprise, he
			was going to take a Vulcan ship to
			Deep Space Four. And from
			there...
			An Al-Leyan transport as far as
			Caere... Then the shuttle to...
			Indri Eight.
			Mister Data, what do we know about
			Indri Eight?
			The Indri system was first
			identified by Federation vessels
			nearly sixty years ago.
			The eighth planet is L-class,
			covered by deciduous vegetation...
			unexplored, but with no apparent
			evidence of civilization, present
			or past. In fact, the planet
			possesses no animal life
			whatsoever.
			Number One, we'll proceed to Indri
			Eight.
			Sir, with all due respect... we've
			run into one dead end... and it
			doesn't sound like Indri Eight is
			any more promising. We're already
			late for the conference on Atalia
			Seven...
			I know Starfleet's timetable.
			Professor Galen visited this
			planet only days ago. And he was
			headed to Indri Eight when he was
			killed. There is a connection
			between the two planets. And I'm
			going to find it.
			Aye, Sir.
			Lay in a course, Ensign. Warp
			seven.
			Come.
			How's it going?
			It's not.
			I thought if I stared at these
			number blocks long enough I might
			start to see some kind of pattern.
			Nothing.
			What I really meant was -- how's
			it going with you?
			As well as can be expected, given
			the circumstances.
			If I had only gone with him --
			... You might both be dead.
			Captain, you can't start thinking
			like that. You didn't abandon
			him. You chose not to abandon a
			life-long career. It was the
			right decision. And it was in no
			way responsible for his death.
			Yes, I realize that.
			I know how much the Professor
			meant to you... and how much you
			want to find out what happened...
			but staring at these numbers isn't
			going to bring him back.
			The conference on Atalia Seven has
			been scheduled for six months.
			Starfleet is relying on your
			mediation efforts to --
			Counselor, this isn't a case of my
			taking the Enterprise and its crew
			on some wild goose chase in order
			to purge myself of guilt or
			remorse.
			I simply will not allow Galen's
			death to be in vain. If that
			means inconveniencing a group of
			squabbling delegates for a few
			more days, then so be it. The
			responsibility is mine.
			Captain.
			We are in range of the planet.
			Riker to Picard... we're
			approaching Indri Eight.
			On my way.
			Sensors are picking up severe
			atmospheric fluctuations on the
			planet...
			Assume a high orbit.
			Mister Worf, onscreen.
			Some kind of plasma reaction is
			consuming the lower atmosphere.
			Can we stop it?
			No, Sir. The reaction is
			global...
			All life on the planet is being
			destroyed.
			Why would anyone want to destroy
			all the life on an uninhabited,
			neutral planet with no strategic
			importance whatsoever?
			All the life...
			What if the Professor's number
			blocks have something to do with
			organic material?
			Narrowing the search parameters to
			the biological database would
			increase the chances that the
			computer could find a match.
			I'll be in the lab.
			Pattern match found.
			Specify.
			The number blocks are mathematical
			representations of fragments of
			deoxyribonucleic acid strands.
			DNA fragments!
			Each from a different lifeform...
			from nineteen different worlds.
			The planets these fragments come
			from are scattered across the
			quadrant. No wonder it took the
			Professor years to collect them.
			But why?
			Wait a minute. These fragments
			all have similar protein
			configurations... they could be
			chemically compatible.
			How can that be possible? They're
			different species... from
			different planets. There
			shouldn't be any compatibility at
			all.
			I know, but look at the base pair
			combinations, they're uniform.
			If I'm right...
			Computer, connect the DNA
			fragments according to protein-link
			compatibility.
			What is it?
			I have no idea...
			This is not a natural design.
			Captain, this is part of an
			algorithm... coded at the
			molecular level.
			An algorithm? Are you saying
			these DNA fragments are elements
			of some kind of computer program?
			I know how it sounds, but there's
			no way this could be a random
			formation. It's definitely part
			of a program.
			This fragment has been part of
			every DNA strand on Earth since
			life began there... and the other
			fragments are just as old.
			Someone would've had to write this
			program over four billion years
			ago.
			So four billion years ago, someone
			scattered this genetic material
			into the primordial soup of at
			least nineteen different planets
			across the galaxy.
			The genetic information must have
			been incorporated into the
			earliest lifeforms on those
			planets, and then passed down
			through each generation.
			But why would anyone do it in the
			first place?
			Do you have any idea what this
			program could be designed to do?
			We couldn't know that until we
			assembled the entire program and
			ran it.
			There are several fragments still
			missing. We've tried all the DNA
			material in Federation records,
			but we can't find any with
			compatible protein configurations.
			Then they must be from worlds
			outside the Federation.
			How many people aboard the
			Enterprise come from non-Federation
			planets?
			Seventeen.
			It may be a long shot, but we
			ought to check each of those
			seventeen people to see if any of
			them have the correct protein
			configurations.
			I'll begin taking DNA samples.
			You know Captain... I've been
			thinking. Someone else must know
			about this program.
			I bet one of the missing fragments
			was on Indri Eight... and that's
			why it was destroyed --
			To keep anyone else from getting
			that piece of the puzzle.
			It's four billion years old... a
			computer program from a highly
			advanced civilization... hidden in
			the fabric of life itself.
			Whatever information is contained
			in that program could be the most
			profound discovery of our time.
			Or the most dangerous. And the
			Professor knew that.
			That's it. Thank you.
			You're next, Mister Mott.
			Glad to be of assistance, Doctor.
			You can always count on me in a
			pinch.
			What do I do?
			Nothing. I'm just going to sample
			some of your skin cells.
			Is this going to hurt?
			About as much as that pedicure you
			gave me last week.
			That was an accident.
			Relax. You won't feel a thing.
			That might be it.
			Of course it is.
			Might be what?
			Let's see if it fits into the
			program.
			Obviously it fits.
			Fits what?
			Close... but no.
			Maybe you're not doing it right.
			Thank you, Mister Mott. That'll
			be all.
			Just trying to help... no one ever
			listens to me...
			They all came up negative.
			I've gone through every page of
			the Professor's published work...
			hoping I'd find a clue about where
			to go next... but so far nothing.
			Maybe we've been at this too long.
			Why don't we both get some sleep
			and start again in the morning.
			"I was in the neighborhood."
			When I asked the Professor what
			took him all the way to Kurl, he
			said he was "in the neighborhood."
			Doing what?
			Collecting a DNA sample,
			perhaps...
			The only planet near the Kurlan
			system capable of supporting life
			is Loren Three.
			There's no Loren Three sample in
			the data we downloaded from the
			Professor's shuttle. If he did
			get one from there it must have
			been taken by the Yridians when
			they attacked.
			Mister Data, set course for Loren
			Three, maximum warp.
			Yes, Sir.
			We are approaching the Loren
			system.
			Slow to half impulse, and take us
			into orbit above the third planet.
			There's a good chance our
			competition has gotten here first.
			Battle stations, Mister Worf.
			Aye.
			We are entering orbit..
			You were right, Captain, we've got
			company.
			Cardassians.
			They are hailing us.
			On screen.
			I am Gul Ocett. Identify
			yourselves and state your business
			in this star system.
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise. And I fail to see why
			I should explain my presence to
			you. Cardassia has no claims on
			this sector.
			No, I suppose not. But my
			admittedly hasty estimate shows
			one Federation Starship and two
			Cardassian war vessels.
			Perhaps I've miscounted.
			Not at all. But the Enterprise is
			on a purely scientific mission.
			You have nothing to gain by
			interfering with us.
			And you have nothing to lose by
			delaying a "purely scientific
			mission" for a few days. I invite
			you to withdraw...
			Captain, a Klingon attack cruiser
			is decloaking off the starboard
			bow!
			They are hailing us.
			This is the Klingon vessel Maht-H'a.
			What are you doing here?
			Captain, a Bird of Prey is
			decloaking off starboard!
			They are hailing us.
			This is the Klingon vessel Maht-H'a.
			Who are you and what are you
			doing here?
			Captain's log, supplemental. It
			seems that we have not one, but
			two competitors in our attempt to
			complete Professor Galen's puzzle.
			I have prevailed upon the
			Cardassian and Klingon Captains to
			meet with me.
			I believe we all know why we're
			here. If we admit that much, we
			can move forward.
			We are merely scouting the planet
			for possible colonization --
			Pah! A ridiculous story.
			And why are you here, then?
			Scientific research.
			There's no point in trying to
			deceive each other... we all know
			about Professor Galen's research
			and about the computer program
			which is composed of DNA
			fragments.
			I'll take your silence as
			confirmation. Now, it stands to
			reason that no one has all the DNA
			fragments necessary to complete
			the program.
			You were the first to arrive in
			this system. Do you have an
			organic sample from the planet
			below?
			Yes. And I will open fire on
			anyone who attempts to obtain
			another one.
			As if we fear Cardassian
			threats...
			I believe one of you also has a
			fragment from Indri Eight.
			Yes. And there will be no other
			samples from Indri Eight.
			What is that supposed to mean?
			He destroyed the planet's
			biosphere after taking the sample.
			Typical Klingon thinking... take
			what you want and then destroy the
			rest.
			Thank you.
			All of us are missing some of the
			fragments... but not necessarily
			the same ones. Unless we combine
			what we have, we'll never learn
			the secret of this program.
			There is no secret. It is an
			ancient weapon design of
			incredible power. And the Klingon
			Empire will not allow it to fall
			into an enemy's hands.
			Or even a friend's...
			A weapon? The Yridian who sold us
			the information claimed that the
			program would yield the key to an
			unlimited power source.
			Until we assemble the entire
			program no on can know its
			ultimate purpose.
			He's right. For all we know it
			might be a recipe for biscuits.
			Biscuits? If that is what you
			believe, then go back to
			Cardassia. I will send you my
			mother's recipe.
			Enough. Without cooperation we
			will get nowhere.
			What do you propose?
			If you both bring the fragments
			you possess to the Enterprise, I
			will combine them with ours. The
			result will be observed by all
			parties simultaneously, giving no
			one the advantage.
			And if we refuse?
			Then this endeavor stops dead,
			right here in this room.
			The screen shows the partly assembled ancient program
			we've seen before. It is obvious that several "pieces"
			are missing.
			Captain.
			Excellent.
			There's still one missing piece...
			Pahk! We have surrendered what we
			had for nothing.
			You are remarkably short-sighted,
			Nu'Daq. We are closer to the
			answer than we were.
			And I think we're very close,
			indeed.
			How can that be? We have no idea
			where to start looking for the
			missing DNA fragment.
			This is a... jigsaw puzzle...
			whose pieces have been scattered
			across the galaxy.
			Doesn't it seem reasonable to
			assume that the original designers
			meant for someone to find this
			puzzle -- why else would they put
			the pieces in our DNA?
			And doesn't that in turn suggest
			that they would try to make it
			easy for us to find all the
			pieces? That there might be
			some... pattern to their
			distribution?
			If that's so... our computer might
			be able to find that pattern.
			Doctor, program the computer to
			analyze the distribution pattern
			of the pieces we have, correcting
			for changes in star configurations
			over four billion years... and
			extrapolate for the missing piece.
			That'll take me a while to set
			up... and a few hours more to
			process.
			If you wish, you may stay on board
			while we wait.
			I intend to.
			Good evening, Commander Data.
			Hello, Captain.
			Is there any word yet on the
			missing fragment?
			The computer is processing the
			data. I will be notified as soon
			as there is any information.
			Commander, your reputation for...
			physical strength is known even in
			the Klingon Empire.
			You are familiar with the B'aht
			Qul challenge?
			I am familiar with many Klingon
			rituals -- including the B'aht
			Qul.
			Wa'... Cha'... Wej --
			Maw' tok.
			My upper spinal support is a polyalloy
			designed for extreme stress.
			My skull is composed of cortenide
			and duranium.
			I understand your intellectual
			prowess is equally impressive.
			If I were to learn the results of
			the computer search before the
			others... It would give the
			Klingon Empire a strategic
			advantage.
			A... being of your abilities would
			go far in the Empire...
			You are attempting to bribe me.
			Not at all.
			You suggested a plan that would
			work to your advantage, one that
			I would be capable of executing.
			You then implied a reward.
			Clearly --
			... Commander, never mind.
			What's this?
			Computer, perform a level three
			diagnostic on the primary
			defensive systems...
			La Forge to Captain Picard...
			What is it, Geordi?
			You might want to come down here,
			sir. I found something... you
			should see.
			The computer has completed its
			analysis.
			The computer was able to
			extrapolate this geometric pattern
			based on the distribution of the
			fragments.
			The same shape as the program...
			Computer, highlight the missing
			section of the pattern.
			The missing DNA fragment should be
			in this system.
			That star is in sector two-one-four-five-nine.
			The Rahm-Izad system.
			Direct hit on our port nacelle.
			They are powering for another
			volley.
			Let's make it look good. Ensign,
			release the inertial dampers.
			They are firing...
			Report, Number One.
			The power boost to the structural
			integrity field protected the
			nacelles. We used the inertial
			dampers to simulate a complete
			shield failure.
			It is fortunate that your Engineer
			discovered Gul Ocett's attempt to
			tamper with your defensive
			systems.
			Maht-h'a. Status.
			Minor damage to starboard nacelle.
			We will be operational in less
			than one hour.
			What? You incompetent Toh-pah.
			You were supposed to be prepared.
			The Cardassian vessels have set a
			course for Rahm-Izad.
			It's not going to take them very
			long to realize that Rahm-Izad is
			the wrong planet.
			You're welcome to join us,
			Captain.
			I will... go with you.
			Ensign, plot a course to the
			Vilmoran System. Warp nine.
			Take us out of warp.
			I am scanning all seven planets in
			the Vilmoran system -- none
			appears to support life.
			How could that be? The
			Professor's data depends on --
			...Correction. The second planet
			shows evidence of an ancient
			ocean, now dry.
			It once supported life.
			Yes. And it still may, in a
			limited fashion not detectable by
			our long range sensors.
			Ensign, lay in a course, full
			impulse.
			Riker to Transporter Room One.
			We've located a planet that may
			still support life. We'll know in
			a minute.
			Any sign of the Cardassians?
			Not yet. But I don't know how
			long it'll stay that way.
			Acknowledged.
			I am reading a small pocket of
			vegetative life -- a primitive
			lichen growing in a fossilized
			seabed.
			Transporter Room One -- I'm
			programming the coordinates.
			Stand-by.
			There.
			Captain, we've got company. I'm
			ready to pull you out of there.
			Wait for my order, Number One.
			You dishonorable pah-tak...
			We can exchange insults some other
			time, perhaps. I'm a little busy
			right now...
			It's been quite a chase, hasn't
			it, my friends?
			How... ?
			We intercepted several communiques
			between the Yridians and
			Cardassia. My ship was watching
			under cloak when Professor Galen's
			shuttle was attacked.
			You've been shadowing us ever
			since.
			And now, the reward...
			Step clear, please.
			I'll destroy this entire
			rockface... And all traces of DNA
			with it.
			You'll go back to Romulus emptyhanded.
			Your superiors will be
			quite pleased.
			The seabed... it may be only
			partially fossilized... it could
			still contain organic material.
			Perhaps we can compromise... Let
			us have the gene code. And the
			Romulans and the Cardassians will
			share the result.
			What's to stop you from killing me
			as soon as I acquiesce?
			You have my word.
			Etched in stone, no doubt.
			No terms. There will be no deals
			as long as I'm still alive.
			Then I have only one recourse...
			The program has activated...
			I think it's reconfiguring the
			tricorder... it's modifying the
			emitter diode to project
			something...
			We die together, Brother. Tash-Koh-Tah.
			You are wondering who we are; why
			we have done this; how it has come
			that I stand before you, the image
			of a being from so long ago.
			Life evolved on my planet before
			all others in this part of the
			galaxy. We left our world,
			explored the stars, and found none
			like ourselves. We were alone.
			Our civilization thrived for ages.
			But what is the life of one race,
			compared to the vast stretches of
			cosmic time? We knew that someday
			we would be gone. And that
			nothing of us would survive. So
			we left you.
			Our scientists seeded the
			primordial oceans of many worlds,
			where life was in its infancy.
			These seed codes directed your
			evolution toward a physical form
			resembling ours -- this body you
			see before you.
			Which is, of course, shaped as
			yours is shaped. For you are the
			end result. The seed codes also
			contained this message, which we
			scattered in fragments on many
			different worlds. It was our hope
			that you would have to come
			together in cooperation and
			fellowship in order to activate
			this message. And if you can see
			and hear me, our hope has been
			fulfilled.
			You are... a monument. Not to our
			greatness, but to our existence.
			That was our wish. That you too
			would know life, and would keep
			alive our memory. There is
			something of us in each of you,
			and so, something of you in each
			other.
			Remember us...
			That is all?
			If she were not dead, I would kill
			her.
			The very notion. That Cardassians
			could have anything in common with
			Klingons.
			It turns my stomach.
			Picard to Enterprise. Away Team
			is ready to beam up.
			Acknowledged.
			Captain's log, Stardate 46735.2.
			Our frequent use of high warp over
			the last few days has overextended
			the propulsion systems. We are
			finishing minor repairs before
			returning to Federation territory.
			It's a shame Professor Galen
			wasn't able to see the end result
			of his search...
			I don't know of anyone who would
			have appreciated it more.
			If it hadn't been for you, Jean-Luc,
			his dream to solve that
			puzzle would never have been
			realized. You gave him a
			wonderful legacy...
			It would've been a more fitting
			legacy if the message had not
			fallen on deaf ears.
			You never know.
			I have to get this day started.
			Both of us.
			See you this afternoon.
			Riker to Captain Picard. Incoming
			transmission from the Romulan
			command ship.
			Put it through.
			Acknowledged.
			Captain, my ships are leaving
			orbit for Romulan space.
			Until our next encounter...
			Until then.
			It would seem that we are not
			completely dissimilar after all...
			in our hopes or in our fears...
			Yes.
			Well, then. Perhaps one day...
			One day...
