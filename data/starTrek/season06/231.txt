			Captain's Log, Stardate 46154.2.
			The Enterprise has entered the
			Amargosa Diaspora, an unusually
			dense globular cluster. We are
			faced with the daunting task of
			charting this vast region.
			Lieutenant Shipley -- let's get
			a triangulation on these sector
			points... (TECH)
			Aye sir.
			Sorry I'm late... I overslept
			again...
			What have you got?
			The cluster's a lot more dense
			than we thought. It's going
			to take three days just to map
			one tenth of it.
			Three days?
			I think we've found a way to speed
			this up. We've been testing a
			method of channeling warp energy
			to the main deflector grid. It
			enhances the long-range sensors...
			The modification would increase
			our sensor efficiency and imaging
			resolution by twenty-five percent
			or more.
			Sounds like that would take a
			lot of warp energy...
			We'd channel it through the EPS
			mains on Deck Thirteen... near
			Cargo Bay Four.
			It's worth a try.
			Data, let's get those subspace
			field taps on-line...
			Commander -- I would like to
			remind you about my poetry reading
			this afternoon.
			Wouldn't miss it for the world.

			I don't understand this... I can

			That poem was written in anapestic

			we move to the iambic septameter
			mode.
			Throughout the ages, from Keats
			to Jorkemo, poets have composed
			odes to the individuals who have

			I don't have any problem getting
			to sleep... and I think I'm
			sleeping all night... but when
			I wake up, I feel exhausted...
			How long has this been going on?
			The last two, three nights...
			Do you have to hold that thing
			so close?
			I'm sorry... I've been on edge
			all day.
			Other than some muscle tension
			in your neck, I don't see anything
			wrong with you physically...
			Have you been having bad dreams?
			Not that I can remember...
			This may be the result of a lack
			of REM sleep...
			What do you recommend?
			Drink this before you go to bed.
			What is it?
			A recipe for a warm milk toddy.
			Warm milk toddy... you're kidding.
			The heat activates amino acids
			in the lactose -- which acts as
			a natural sedative.
			Besides, this is a recipe of the
			Captain's Aunt Adelle. It's
			delicious.
			At this point, I'll give anything
			a try.
			Thanks.
			Everything's in place... deflector
			grid couplers... subspace field
			taps...
			Let's do it. Lieutenant Shipley
			-- initiate warp power transfer...
			Aye sir...
			Sensor array on-line...
			Come on... work...
			Geordi -- active scanner output
			has increased by twenty-six
			percent.
			Inform Astrophysics that the new
			La Forge sensor array is on-line
			and awaiting major scientific
			discoveries.
			Yes sir.
			Geordi... may I make a personal
			inquiry? It concerns my poetry
			reading.
			Sure, Data... what is it?
			I noticed that many spectators
			seemed distracted during my
			presentation. Was my poetry
			uninteresting?
			Well... it was very well
			constructed... a real tribute
			to form...
			I especially liked your Haiku
			poem...
			My Haiku was only three lines
			long.
			Yeah... it was great... very...
			brisk...
			Brisk...
			Geordi, are you saying that the
			shorter my poems, the better?
			No... well... sort of...
			To be honest, Data... some of your
			longer poems were a little dry.
			Maybe some of your poems were a
			little... formal.
			I have found poetry more
			challenging than other artistic
			endeavors. Unlike painting and
			musical composition, it demands
			a more articulated emotional
			content.
			Next time, don't worry so much
			about rhyme and meter. Some of the
			world's greatests poets didn't pay
			attention to rules...
			That's the power grid warning...
			I am reading a massive EPS
			explosion.
			Where?
			I am attempting to localize it...
			It is Cargo Bay Four.
			I've got three people down there!
			Damage control, medical team, to
			Cargo Bay Four!
			Let's go...
			The field imbalance has subsided.
			I believe it is safe to enter.
			There may still be a residual
			discharge. Stand clear.
			Is there something wrong, sir?
			We analyzed the power conduits
			-- there's no evidence of an EPS
			explosion.
			Sensors seemed to think there
			was...
			I think my modification to the
			sensor array may have caused a
			pattern recognition failure.
			Just a sensor glitch?
			That's my guess.
			Perform a level three diagnostic
			on the internal sensor network.
			Make sure we haven't overlooked
			anything.
			Aye sir.
			Maybe we should pick this up
			in the morning, Mister La Forge
			-- get a fresh start.
			And would you do me a favor?
			Stop by my quarters at oh-seven
			hundred hours. I've been having
			trouble waking up.
			Sure. Goodnight.
			Goodnight.
			Who is it?
			Commander La Forge.
			Good morning, sir.
			Morning? I just went to bed...
			Sir -- it's oh seven hundred
			hours.
			Mister Worf! My good Klingon,
			sir, welcome. It's a pleasure
			to have you with us again... so...
			soon.
			Haircut today, Lieutenant? Trim
			your beard?
			I would like my hair trimmed.
			Ah. A trim, of course...
			Not like last time.
			Oh no -- just a little off the
			top... took way too much off last
			time...
			I was just telling my colleague
			Mister Setti how thick and
			luxuriant Klingon hair is... it's
			such a pleasure to cut, sometimes
			I get carried away...
			All those Away Missions...
			wind... dry air... the elements
			are very harsh on the hair. I'd
			like to suggest you start using
			a conditioning agent...
			I promise -- not too much off
			the top!
			Just before the grid alarm
			sounded, we were running warp
			power through this junction...
			somehow, it must've tripped the
			internal scanners...
			And they showed it as an EPS
			explosion...
			The question is, why? I've made
			modifications to the sensors
			before... and nothing like this
			ever happened.
			We can't waste time chasing down
			sensor ghosts. Keep the array
			off-line until you have a chance
			to take a closer look.
			Aye sir...
			I know the feeling... the past
			few nights, it seems the second
			my head hits the pillow, it's time
			to get up again.
			We could all use some shore leave
			after this survey.
			Definitely.
			Keep me informed.
			Data, will you give me a hand?
			I've got to run a structural
			integrity scan. I want to make
			sure the conduit wasn't weakened
			by the --
			Ow...
			What is it?
			This is the second time today my
			VISOR's cut out...
			Are you alright, Geordi?
			I don't know... I just had a weird
			feeling...
			I think I'd better get to
			Sickbay...
			I will run the integrity scan.
			Thanks...
			This is curious...
			There's a slight bacterial
			infection around your neural
			inputs... it was probably
			interrupting the data stream.
			Infection... from what?
			It doesn't match any bacterial
			strains on record...
			I'm going to sterilize the area...
			but I'll need to run a resonance
			tissue scan to look for signs of
			additional infection...
			Come over here...
			You'll need to hold still...
			How's the scan going, Data?
			I have just started the scan.
			I thought you were going to
			Sickbay.
			I've been there for the past hour
			and a half.
			That is not possible.
			My internal chronometer indicates
			it has been exactly one minute,
			fifteen seconds since you left
			the room.
			I'm telling you, Data, I've been
			gone for over an hour.
			Computer -- what time is it?
			The time is fourteen twenty-seven
			hours.
			You are correct. Ninety-two
			minutes, seventeen seconds have
			passed since you left the room.
			What have you been doing all this
			time?
			I have no memory of events during
			that period.
			When we are finished here, I will
			perform a self-diagnostic.
			First we pick up a false EPS
			explosion... then my VISOR cuts
			out twice... now you lose an
			hour... all in the Cargo Bay...
			La Forge to Engineering -- I want
			a diagnostic team to Cargo Bay
			Two immediately.
			On our way, sir.
			Ensign Rager -- cartography needs
			a better position to study cluster
			FGC-thirteen.
			Bring us about, heading one twenty
			three mark four.
			Aye sir.
			Helm won't lock to those
			coordinates, sir.
			First time navigating through a
			globular cluster, Ensign?
			You've got to compensate for
			gravimetric interference
			before you...
			Sir... is there something wrong?
			No... I don't know...
			Maintain your original course,
			Ensign...
			Don't tell me...
			This can't be right...
			Data, can you come take a look
			at this?
			I think we've got another sensor
			glitch.
			The sensors are functioning
			normally...
			They are detecting a subspace
			particle emission originating from
			within this room.
			Within this room... that's not
			possible...
			The emission is emanating from
			this direction...
			Geordi...
			The structure of the bulkhead is
			being altered on a subatomic
			level. The metal itself is in
			a state of quasi-molecular flux.
			What's causing it?
			This is where it gets pretty wild,
			Captain...
			Behind this panel, there's a
			junction we were using to transfer
			warp power to the sensor array.
			We're picking up a subspace
			particle stream emanating from
			that junction...
			It appears to be composed of
			spatially-inverted tetryon
			particles.
			We believe they are emanating
			from a tertiary subspace manifold.
			I thought tetryons were unstable
			in normal space...
			We don't understand it either,
			sir.
			Something from that deep in
			subspace shouldn't be able to
			exist in our universe...
			But here it is.
			Does this pose a danger to the
			ship?
			Not unless it spreads... if it
			does, we could beam the bulkhead
			into space and erect a forcefield
			in its place.
			Keep that option ready. For now,
			proceed with the analysis.
			Aye sir.
			When I sat down at the console,
			it triggered a response... like
			I was trapped... I had to get out
			of there...
			Was it something about the console
			itself?
			No... it seemed disconnected
			somehow... maybe it's something
			I dreamed...
			Wil... you're the third person
			today who's come to me with
			something like this... an intense
			emotional response provoked by
			an object...
			Did anyone know why they had that
			reaction?
			No... they couldn't explain it
			any more than you could...
			At this point, I'm not willing
			to say it's coincidence.
			Maybe we should all get together.
			Talking about it might help you
			understand the response...
			I'm going to find out if anyone
			else on the ship has been having
			experiences like this...
			Wil... you said you had an unusual
			reaction when you sat down at the
			console. What was it like?
			It's hard to describe... it was
			vague... like the way you recall
			a dream...
			I remember the sensation of being
			trapped... and something about
			a smooth surface...
			Can anyone else describe what they
			felt?
			I had a similar response... to
			a pair of scissors.
			Have you had any dreams about
			scissors recently?
			I may have... I do not have a
			distinct memory of it...
			When my VISOR cut out in the Cargo
			Bay, I had a weird feeling too...
			something about a smooth
			surface...
			Smooth... and cold... I think
			it was cold...
			Yes, cold...
			It was elevated... a platform...
			Right... a bench...
			Or a table...
			It sounds like you've all had a
			similar experience...
			Do you remember anything more
			about it besides the table?
			Maybe there's a way we can help
			ourselves remember more...
			You all remember a table...
			let's start with that...
			Computer -- show me a table...
			There are five thousand
			forty-seven classifications of
			tables on file. Specify design
			parameters.
			Can you remember anything specific
			about the table? You mentioned
			it was cold, and smooth...
			Do you remember what shape it was?
			Long... it was long...
			Yeah... a rectangular shape...
			Computer -- create a rectangular
			conference table.
			It's too high...
			Computer... decrease table height
			by... twenty-five percent...
			No... the table was smaller...
			and it was inclined...
			Computer -- decrease the table's
			surface area by... twenty
			percent...
			And incline the top... fifteen
			degrees...
			It wasn't made of wood... it was
			smoother... more metallic...
			Computer -- make this a metal
			table.
			That's starting to look right...
			Was there anything else in the
			room? Furniture... chairs...
			a door... other people...
			No... it was dark...
			Dark, right... you couldn't see
			beyond the table...
			Computer -- lower the surrounding
			light level.
			There was a light right in my
			face... a bright light...
			Computer -- give me a bright
			light... right above the table...
			Specify light source.
			I couldn't tell.. it was above
			me... an overhead lamp...
			Estimated distance of light
			source.
			I don't know...
			It seemed like it was at least...
			two, three meters above...
			Brighter...
			Brighter.
			Wil... you said you were uneasy
			when you sat down at the Conn
			position...
			Yeah... I felt trapped by the
			console...
			But it wasn't like this... there
			was something else here...
			A restraint of some kind?
			Yes... a restraint... it came
			down over my legs...
			No, no... my chest... it came
			across my chest...
			It was holding you down...
			Yes... it was part of the
			table...
			Here... right here...
			Computer -- create a restraining
			arm... attached to the right side
			of the table, at the mid-point...
			Was it like that?
			Computer -- put controls on the
			restraint... a control panel...
			lights...
			There was something else here...
			above me... a metal swing arm...
			Computer -- create a metal swing-arm,
			double-jointed, total length
			one meter...
			Connect it to the head of the
			table...
			There was something attached to
			it...
			A tool of some sort...
			scissor-like...
			Computer -- produce a pair of
			scissors... attached to the
			armature...
			The handle is wrong...
			... It wasn't scissors...
			Computer -- make the handle a
			single grip... ten centimeters
			long... solid metal...
			Make one blade longer... and
			curved inward...
			Give the second blade a...
			jagged edge...
			Tetryons... the same particles
			in the Cargo Bay...
			I have completed my
			self-diagnostic, and confirmed
			that I was not aboard the
			Enterprise for ninety minutes,
			seventeen seconds yesterday
			afternoon.
			Explanation?
			Whenever I am on the ship, the
			warp field leaves an
			electromagnetic signature on my
			internal servo fluid system.
			Yesterday, between twelve
			fifty-four and fourteen twenty-six
			hours that signature is missing.
			Computer -- are there any
			crewmembers missing from the
			Enterprise?
			There are two crewmembers
			unaccounted for.
			Identify them.
			Lieutenant Edward Hagler and
			Ensign Sariel Rager.
			When did they leave?
			They have not been present since
			twenty-three thirty-two hours.
			How did they leave?
			Method of departure unknown.
			Picard to Bridge.
			Bridge here.
			Raise shields and maintain a Level
			Four security alert -- I want to
			know if anyone goes on or off this
			ship.
			Aye sir.
			Mister La Forge, Mister Data --
			I believe if we find the source
			of those tetryon emissions, we
			may also find our missing
			crewmembers.
			We'll get on it, sir.
			Doctor Crusher -- you'd better
			take a look at this...
			My God...
			What is it?
			Commander... it looks as though
			your arm has been severed and
			reattached.
			What?
			The skeletal structure in your
			radius and ulna is offset by
			point zero two microns...
			Your arm has been amputated...
			then surgically reattached.
			Any progress, Lieutenant?
			Take a look at this...
			Data -- the tetryon emissions have
			intensified. They seem to be
			focusing in this direction...
			... coalescing here... they're
			reading as a point of subspace
			energy.
			It appears to be the beginnings
			of a spatial rupture.
			The way the tetryon emissions are
			modulating... it's like somebody
			is controlling the flow of
			energy...
			Data... some of the signals from
			the modifications I made to the
			sensor array dipped pretty deep
			into subspace...
			Maybe they caught somebody's
			attention...
			At the rate the rupture is
			expanding, we are in danger of
			a hull breach.
			Let's try surrounding it with
			a subspace containment field...
			Other than the tetryon emissions
			in Cargo Bay Four, none of the
			internal sensors recorded
			anything unusual over the past
			three days.
			Initiate a metallurgical analysis
			of the ship's hull -- subspace
			field incursions might have left
			a trace.
			Captain -- sensors indicate that
			Lieutenant Hagler has returned
			to the Enterprise. He is in his
			quarters, Deck Seven, Section
			Nineteen.
			Computer -- emergency entry, Chief
			Medical Officer Beverly Crusher.
			Crusher to Sickbay -- get a plasma
			infusion unit to Deck Seven,
			Section Nineteen!
			His blood is transforming into
			some sort of... liquid polymer...
			We've set up a containment field
			in Cargo Bay Four. But the
			rupture just keeps expanding.
			I'd say we've got another five
			or six hours before it breaches
			the hull.
			Can we still beam the affected
			sections into space?
			No sir. The spatial rupture is
			creating severe nucleonic
			interference. It is impossible
			to obtain a positive lock on the
			bulkheads.
			Has your analysis suggested any
			way to seal the rupture?
			We think we could close the
			rupture by neutralizing the
			tetryon emissions with a coherent
			graviton pulse. But we'd have
			to do it at the source.
			How do we find the source?
			That's a good question. The
			emissions are coming from a
			tertiary subspace domain. But
			subspace has an infinite number
			of domains...
			It's like a huge honeycomb with
			an endless number of cells. We
			need to isolate the exact cell
			the emissions are coming from...
			If someone homed in on subspace
			signals created by our modified
			sensor array... can we do the same
			thing to them -- track the tetryon
			emissions to their universe?
			Tetryon particles have a random
			momentum. Our sensors are unable
			to track them.
			Perhaps we could make a homing
			device -- something our sensors
			could track.
			Good idea. But there's no way
			to get that device to the source.
			Yes, there is.
			Give it to me.
			It's pretty clear I've been taken
			each of the past few nights...
			if I'm right, there's every chance
			it'll happen again tonight.
			If you had a homing device, we
			could track it to your location
			in subspace... then, as soon as
			they send you back to the ship...
			we could transmit the graviton
			pulse and neutralize the tetryon
			emissions...
			If they send him back. Ensign
			Rager still hasn't been
			returned...
			They're going to take me whether
			I want to go or not.
			We'll wait as long as we can for
			you to be returned, Number One.
			But as soon the spatial rupture
			threatens the ship... we'll have
			to transmit that graviton pulse.
			Understood.
			Perhaps we can give you an
			advantage... a way of keeping you
			conscious after they take you...
			Doctor -- can you develop a
			counter-agent to the
			neuro-sedative they've been giving
			the crew?
			I could try a neuro-stimulant
			-- but the dosage would have to
			be pretty high to counter the
			effects. It might be risky.
			It's a risk I'm willing to take.
			Make it so.
			Mister La Forge -- begin work on
			a homing device.
			It should be enough to ward off
			their neuro-sedative for about
			twelve hours.
			I hope that's enough.
			It'll have to be. I can't risk
			giving you a higher dosage.
			I've locked the tricorder into
			continuous scan. That way, it'll
			keep recording whether you open
			it or not.
			Maybe you can bring back some
			information about their universe.
			When you see this indicator light
			up, it means we've locked onto
			the signal.
			Understood.
			Report.
			I still can't locate the homing
			signal...
			We've covered the entire
			upper-subspace energy band. We're
			extending the scan to adjacent
			energy levels...
			Picard to Data. Your status?
			The rupture has expanded another
			four point two percent. Without
			further reinforcement, containment
			field integrity will fail in
			approximately fourteen minutes.
			Can you divert more power to the
			containment field?
			I can try to augment the field
			with auxiliary power, but it won't
			be much...
			Make it so.
			Aye sir.
			Captain -- I've located the homing
			signal. Locking onto it now...
			It's coming from a subspace energy
			level of sixteen point-two
			K-E-V...
			Stand by to initiate the graviton
			pulse.
			Graviton emitters at full power,
			sir. Standing by.
			Picard to Data. How much time?
			At the present rate, containment
			failure will occur in
			approximately nine minutes.
			Captain -- the containment field
			is beginning to fluctuate.
			Failure anticipated in three
			minutes, eleven seconds.
			We can't afford to wait any
			longer...
			Begin the graviton pulse.
			Initiating pulse... now.
			Data to Engineering. The graviton
			pulse is having an effect. The
			tetryon emissions have decreased
			by nineteen percent...
			Captain -- additional subharmonics
			have appeared. They are
			reinforcing the tetryon
			emissions...
			They appear to be counter-acting
			the graviton pulse...
			The rupture is beginning to expand
			again.
			Looks like somebody's fighting
			back...
			Can you strengthen the graviton
			pulse?
			I'll try setting up a random
			frequency shift. If we can keep
			them from guessing our pulse
			modulation... they might not be
			able to compensate...
			Tetryon emissions continue to
			increase.
			The rupture is still expanding.
			Hull breach is imminent.
			They're reacting faster than we
			can shift frequencies...
			Shipley -- program the emitters
			for full spectrum pulse
			compression. I want to channel
			all of the graviton energy into
			a single burst...
			Let's see if they can handle
			that...
			Ready, Commander.
			The rupture is beginning to close.
			Recharge the emitters! Let's hit
			them again!
			Come on...
			Ready.
			The rupture is ninety-six percent
			closed.
			We're almost there. One more
			burst should do it...
			Emitters recharging...
			Ready.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46119.2.
			The tetryon emissions in Cargo
			Bay Four have ceased, and there
			have been no further indications
			of alien intrusions. All
			Enterprise crewmembers are safe
			and accounted for. But we are
			still left with some unanswered
			questions...
			Based on the information gathered
			by Commander Riker's tricorder,
			we have determined that the
			molecular structure of the alien
			life forms is solanogen-based.
			We think that's why they couldn't
			come through into our space, as
			easily as they could take us into
			theirs...
			They needed to learn how to
			remodulate their cellular energy
			states in order to survive in our
			universe.
			The tricorder readings indicate
			they created a small pocket of
			our universe in their lab to
			keep those who were abducted
			alive.
			Like putting a fish in a bucket
			of water...
			They were probably trying to do
			the same thing in Cargo Bay Four
			-- create a pocket of their
			universe in ours.
			What can we do to prevent this
			from happening again?
			It looks like they found us
			initially by discovering my
			modified sensor signal. We should
			warn all Starfleet ships not
			to make the same mistake.
			Have you any idea what came
			through the rupture, before you
			were able to shut it down?
			No sir. We were unable to track
			it once it left the Cargo Bay.
			Maybe it was a probe of some
			kind...
			Perhaps they are simply curious.
			Explorers, like ourselves.
			Ensign Rager and I were lucky to
			escape... and Lieutenant
			Hagler's dead...
			I have a feeling that whoever
			sent that thing... was more
			than simply curious.
