			Captain's Log, Stardate 46235.7
			Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien, Guinan
			and I are returning to the
			Enterprise after a fascinating
			visit to the planet Marlonia.
			... and I found these pieces in
			the tertiary level of the dig.
			They're typical of second century
			Marlonian cookware.
			Mmmm-hmmmm.
			Now, see these markings...
			they're very similar to some early
			Taguan designs... but the
			patterns are more intricate...
			closer to Buranian than Taguan.
			So... you went to one of the most
			beautiful planets in this quadrant
			and spent your entire shore
			leave... in a cave.
			It was a very rewarding
			experience.
			Look at these fragments... they're
			in nearly perfect condition...
			and they're over seven hundred
			years old.
			So's my father.
			Is that a Draebidium Froctus?
			Draebidium Calimus actually...
			you can tell by the shape of the
			leaves.
			I didn't know you were interested
			in plant biology.
			I... took a class at the
			Academy... I just remember a few
			things...
			Enterprise to Shuttlecraft
			Fermi...
			This is the Fermi. Go ahead
			Enterprise.
			We have just received a distress
			signal from the Starfleet science
			team on Ligos Seven.
			Any indication of the problem?
			No, sir. The call was cut off
			mid-transmission.
			Lay in a course and prepare to
			engage at Warp eight once we're
			aboard.
			Aye, sir.
			We'll rendezvous with the ship
			in three minutes, sir.
			We're caught in some kind of
			energy field.
			Hard about, full impulse.
			Aye, sir.
			What's happening, Mister Worf?
			The shuttle's been enveloped by
			an energy field, sir.
			Their engines and life support
			have failed.
			Increase to full impulse.
			Bridge to Transporter Room Three.
			Prepare to beam the shuttle crew
			aboard once we're in range.
			Ready, sir.
			There's too much interference...
			I can't contact the Enterprise...
			Transfer auxiliary power to the
			inertial dampers...
			Warning. Structural failure
			imminent.
			O'Brien, do you have them?
			I'm trying, sir... I can't get
			a pattern lock.
			The shuttle's coming apart, Chief.
			You've got to do it now.
			I've got them.
			There's a forty percent drop in
			mass. I may have lost one of
			them...
			Thank you, Mister O'Brien.
			Another moment and...
			According to the bio-scans, their
			DNA structures are now consistent
			with those of pre-adolescents.
			But as far as I can tell, only
			their bodies have changed.
			Their individual intelligence and
			behavioral responses are all
			exactly the same as they were
			before the accident.
			What happened to the shuttlecraft,
			Number One?
			The shuttle broke up just after
			we beamed you out. Data's
			coordinating the salvage effort
			right now.
			Sir.
			What about the energy field the
			shuttle passed through?
			We've been trying to scan it, but
			it's putting out a lot of
			interference. It's going to take
			some time.
			We can't afford to stay here any
			longer. We'll leave a class four
			probe behind to study the energy
			field but the distress signal
			from Ligos Seven has top priority.
			Let me know as soon as you have
			any further information, Doctor.
			Number One, you're with me.
			Captain... there are some
			additional tests I'd like to
			run...
			Of course...
			The three of you will remain as
			needed to assist Doctor Crusher.
			What?
			You know... you make a pretty
			cute kid.
			Great. Just what I want to be...
			cute.
			Were you this much fun when you
			were a kid?
			I was in a refugee camp. "Fun"
			wasn't exactly in my vocabulary.
			What about now? You're not in
			that camp anymore.
			"Fun" is being back at work...
			in my own uniform.
			Bridge.
			Mister Worf. Prepare to launch
			a class four probe to study the
			energy field.
			I realize how unusual this must
			seem...
			My appearance is the result of
			an accident, involving myself and
			three other crew members... the
			effects of which Doctor Crusher
			is currently working to remedy.
			I assure you, I am Captain Picard.
			The probe. Aye, sir.
			Mister Data, have you secured all
			of the shuttle debris?
			Almost, sir. It is being stored
			in Shuttlebay Two.
			Very well.
			Ensign, as soon as Mister Data
			is finished take us to Ligos at
			warp eight.
			Captain, may I see you privately
			for a few moments?
			Of course.
			Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.
			Have you been able to determine
			the cause of our transformation?
			Not yet. I'm still waiting for
			some test results.
			I see.
			There are one hundred and three
			members of the science team on
			Ligos Seven. We should prepare
			shuttlebay three for a triage
			center in case they have large
			numbers of casualties.
			We'll be ready.
			Ligos Seven is prone to periodic
			volcanic activity... perhaps the
			planet has entered an active
			phase---
			Jean-Luc.
			I think we need to talk.
			All right. Let's talk.
			Are you here to relieve me of
			duty?
			I'd rather not have to take that
			step.
			I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My
			judgement, my experiences, my
			mental capacities are all
			intact.
			That's true... for now. This
			could be the first stage of a
			condition which may begin to
			affect your mind as well.
			But you've seen no evidence of
			that?
			Not yet.
			What I do know is that the Captain
			of this ship has just gone through
			an extreme physical
			transformation... the ultimate
			effects of which I can't even
			begin to guess.
			You are asking me to step down.
			You're still Jean-Luc Picard...
			what do you think you should do?
			Commander Riker, please take
			command of the ship until further
			notice.
			Understood, sir.
			So what the hell am I supposed
			to do now?
			You're not supposed to do
			anything. That's what "relieved
			of duty" means.
			Well, I should be doing
			something... instead of just
			standing around waiting for them
			to find a cure.
			You're right.
			Let's go play.
			What?
			I haven't been young for a long
			time... and I intend to enjoy
			every minute of it.
			Fine. Enjoy yourself.
			What are you going to do... go
			back to your room and pout?
			I am not twelve years old. If
			I want to go to my quarters and
			contemplate my situation, it does
			not mean that I am... pouting.
			Okay, okay.
			I could use a... cup of coffee.
			How about you?
			I'll get it.
			Two coffees... one with cream...
			Black... double sweet...
			I know.
			One double sweet.
			Careful... that's hot...
			Miles...
			Sorry.
			What's wrong?
			It's... I don't know... but this
			feels wrong, somehow.
			Miles Edward O'Brien. I am still
			your wife.
			Technically, yes.
			Technically?
			No. I mean, of course you're my
			wife... but you're also ten years
			old.
			Beverly said it's actually closer
			to twelve.
			That's not the point.
			So what is the point? Is our
			marriage over?
			I didn't say that. But until they
			find a way to reverse this... this
			effect... it's going to be hard
			for me to ignore the fact that
			you're a little girl.
			What if they can't find a way?
			What if I'm like this the rest
			of my life? What does that mean
			for us, for our family?
			Mommy?
			What's wrong, Sweetheart?
			I want Mommy to read me a story.
			All right. What story would you
			like to hear?
			I want Mommy.
			What if Daddy reads you a story
			tonight? Will that be okay?
			I'll be right back.
			Keiko...
			It's going to be all right... I
			promise... we'll work this out...
			How?
			I don't know.
			First Officer's Log: Supplemental.
			The Enterprise has reached the
			Ligos system, and we have begun
			to search for the missing
			Federation science team. Doctor
			Crusher reports no progress on
			finding a cure for the members
			of the shuttle crew.
			Come.
			I came to see how you're doing.
			I'll have to speak to my tailor,
			but otherwise I'm well, thank you.
			It's just so... ridiculous. I
			can't really take myself seriously
			like this...
			What's wrong?
			Counselor... if Doctor Crusher
			can't find a cure... and I have
			to stay this way... no one's going
			to take me seriously, are they?
			I would say the people who know
			you, who've worked with you for
			years, will be able to make the
			adjustment eventually.
			But... there are some cultures
			that would not accept a
			twelve-year-old captain as a
			negotiating partner or a credible
			emissary.
			In that case, I suppose I'll have
			to wait until... I grow up again
			before I'll get another command.
			That could be ten years... maybe
			fifteen...
			The question is... what to do
			until then?
			You're still a captain... I'm sure
			there are other assignments you
			could be given.
			I've spent thirty years of my life
			aboard starships... I'm not about
			to sit behind a desk now.
			You could return to the Academy...
			get another degree... brush up
			on your Latin.
			And be Wesley's room-mate, I
			suppose.
			I will admit that returning to
			the Academy does have a certain
			appeal... but I've always spent
			my life looking forward... going
			to the Academy again feels like...
			looking back.
			Then perhaps you could use this
			time to explore another interest...
			archeology for instance?
			Leave Starfleet?
			Not permanently... just a
			sabbatical. You could spend ten
			years crawling through caves and
			digging up artifacts... and still
			have enough time to become the
			youngest admiral in Starfleet.
			It would give me a chance to
			accompany Doctor Langford on her
			exploration of the ruins on Suvin
			Four... but to leave the
			Enterprise...
			In a way, you're very lucky. You
			have a chance do what most people
			can only dream about... have a
			second childhood without the pain
			of growing up.
			This is Captain Picard's
			rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure
			from a tissue sample I took this
			morning. It's the same as a sample
			I took before the accident --
			except it's missing several key
			viroxic sequences.
			I'm afraid it's been a long time
			since I took genetics, Doctor.
			RVN is one of the key factors in
			our development during puberty.
			Unlike DNA, which never changes,
			RVN takes on additional viroxic
			sequences during adolescence.
			Those sequences determine how we
			develop physically. Without
			them...
			We would never mature into adults.
			Exactly. Somehow, those key
			sequences were eliminated in
			the Captain and the others
			during transport.
			So what can we do?
			There are a couple of options.
			These are the plants Keiko was
			carrying on the shuttle. Whatever
			turned the crew into children
			turned these into seedlings.
			We accelerated the growth on
			one of them, and it developed
			into a perfectly normal adult
			plant.
			I don't suppose that would work
			on people.
			No... but it does tell us that
			if we do nothing, they'll probably
			grow up as they did before.
			That's one option...
			I do have adult RVN patterns
			on all four of them. I might
			be able to send them back
			through the Transporter pattern
			buffer and replace the missing
			sequences... but we can't even
			attempt that until we know why
			this happened in the first place.
			If they were, somehow, to lose
			more viroxic sequences...
			They'd come back even younger.
			I've got the sensor report on the
			shuttle break-up.
			It looks like the break-up began
			near the starboard bulkhead.
			There are some bulkhead fragments
			over here.
			My VISOR's picking up torsional
			stress damage... some
			micro-fractures...
			Wait a minute... what's this?
			Looks like tritanium from the
			hull.
			Yeah... but watch.
			It's not tritanium anymore...
			somehow the molecular structure
			of the alloy's been changed --
			broken down into its constituent
			elements...
			No wonder the bulkhead
			shattered...
			Let's get a sample down to
			Engineering. I want to run a
			metallurgical analysis.
			Well, this is exciting.
			Would you rather be playing with
			dolls?
			I'd rather be doing almost
			anything other than sitting here
			and watching you sulk.
			This isn't some kind of glorious
			second childhood, Guinan. Our
			bodies have been violated...
			changed... doesn't that bother
			you?
			Sure it bothers me, but at the
			moment I can't do anything about
			it. So I might as well enjoy it.
			Enjoy what? Where did you get
			the idea that being short and
			awkward is some kind of wonderful
			gift?
			There must've been some part of
			childhood that you didn't loathe.
			Come on... tell me one happy
			memory you have.
			Look. It was a long, depressing
			period of my life and I was
			grateful when it was finally
			over. I'd rather not relive it.
			I bet you were a jumper.
			A jumper. You know, someone who
			jumped up and down on furniture
			all the time.
			What?
			You were a jumper all right. The
			quiet ones... they always look
			so innocent... you think you can
			turn your back on them... then
			next thing you know -- bam!
			They're bouncing on the bed.
			That is the most ridiculous thing
			I've ever heard. Most of the time
			I didn't even have a bed.
			Ah... but you did have one
			sometimes... and I bet you jumped
			on it.
			I most certainly did not.
			Yeah... I can see it in your
			eyes... you can barely resist the
			urge to leap up and start jumping
			around like a Tarkassian
			razorbeast.
			Guinan...
			Oh yeah... oh yeah...
			This is ridiculous.
			That's right... and don't you dare
			join me, Ro Laren. You don't like
			jumping on beds!
			We think the shuttle was caught
			in a molecular reversion field,
			which caused the structure of the
			ship to deteriorate. When the
			field penetrated the hull, it also
			began to affect the shuttle crew.
			When I tried to beam them off,
			I wasn't able to get a lock
			because the reversion field was
			masking part of their patterns.
			If the Transporter only registered
			part of their RVN patterns...
			that would explain why the key
			sequences are missing.
			Exactly. And without those key
			sequences, the Transporter
			reconstructed them as children.
			If they're right, will you be able
			to use the Transporter to reverse
			the effects?
			I think so. As long as there's
			no reversion field to mask the
			patterns, we should be able to
			do it.
			Chief, can we adjust the molecular
			imaging scanners to accept --
			Bridge to Commander Riker.
			Go ahead.
			We're entering orbit around Ligos
			Seven, sir.
			On my way.
			We'll discuss this later.
			Standard orbit, Ensign.
			Any sign of the science team?
			We have been scanning the area
			since entering the system, but
			our readings are being disrupted.
			Cause?
			Extreme fluctuations in the E.M.
			field.
			However, there is no evidence of
			relevant stellar or seismic
			activity which would cause the
			interference.
			Any response to our hails, Mister
			Worf?
			No, sir. I have been attempting
			to---
			Commander, two ships decloaking
			fore and aft.
			Klingon birds of prey... B'rel
			class.
			Maximum shields. Take us out
			of orbit, Ensign. Mister Worf,
			prepare to return fire...
			Damage report.
			We've lost primary life-support.
			Switching to secondary systems.
			Lock phasers on target bearing
			to port.
			Phasers locked.
			Fire.
			Minor damage to one ship. Its
			shields are holding.
			Starboard power coupling is
			down... warp engines off-line.
			Shields?
			Down to thirteen percent.
			Casualties reported on decks
			twenty-six and twenty-seven...
			Sensors and secondary generators
			off-line... life support down
			to sixty-seven percent...
			Engineering, status report.
			Their last shots took out
			auxiliary power and emergency
			back-ups. It'll take at least
			an hour to get warp power back
			on-line.
			We've lost shields. Heavy
			casualties on decks thirty-five
			through forty.
			I am detecting Transporter
			signatures in three cargo bays.
			We are being boarded.
			Initiate intruder alert. All
			security teams to proceed to --
			Put down your weapons.
			Computer, deactivate all command
			functions. Authorization,
			Riker-Omega-Three...
			All command functions suspended.
			This is Morta. We have secured
			the Bridge. Begin transporting
			all able-bodied adults to the
			surface.
			They have locked out the command
			functions.
			You said they would not have time.
			You led the assault team, you were
			too slow.
			You dare to blame me!
			We have secured the ship, Daimon,
			but Morta's incompetence has
			denied us access to---
			My incompetence! Daimon, you know
			that I am --
			Enough.
			Where is the Captain of this ship?
			I'm in command of this vessel.
			Who are you and on whose authority
			do you --
			I am Daimon Lurin and I now
			declare this ship to be a loss
			and open to claim according to
			the Ferengi Salvage Code. You
			will cooperate with our salvage
			operations or we will begin
			executing your crew.
			Is everyone all right?
			No fatalities or injuries among
			the children. The Ferengi have
			control of Main Engineering and
			decks twenty-three through
			thirty-seven.
			We have to assume they've also
			taken the Bridge.
			Captain... do you know what
			they've done with the younger
			children... with my little girl?
			They're taking all the adults down
			to the surface. It looks like
			they're keeping all the children
			on board the ship. Where was your
			daughter?
			In primary care on deck fourteen.
			Then she's probably still there
			with the others.
			But we'll make certain.
			We need to regain control of the
			ship. Options?
			We could flood the ship with
			anesthizine gas.
			That's locked out along with the
			rest of the command functions.
			If they're typical Ferengi,
			they're probably very pleased
			with themselves about now...
			maybe even getting a little
			overconfident.
			Agreed. They might not think they
			need much of their crew to hold
			the ship. We could use the
			element of surprise to give
			ourselves a tactical advantage...
			Tactical advantage... ?
			Jean-Luc... look at your team for
			a minute. We're children.
			We can't just stay here while our
			ship is being commandeered.
			I'm not suggesting that we do.
			But we can't act as if we were
			still adults.
			What do you suggest?
			We look like children. Maybe it's
			time we started acting like
			children.
			I hope your profit margin is
			pretty high on this little
			adventure, Lurin... because
			you're risking war with the
			Federation.
			We're not affiliated with the
			Ferengi Alliance. We're... in
			business for ourselves.
			And yes, it will be highly
			profitable. For an investment of
			two surplus Klingon ships... a few
			repairs... and some weapons...
			we've netted a Federation starship
			and her crew, not to mention a
			planet rich in Vendarite.
			So that's what this is all about.
			What did you do with the science
			team that was on the surface?
			They have proved most... helpful
			in extracting the mineral.
			You made them slave laborers.
			The addition of your crew will
			greatly speed up the process.
			As for your ship... I'm sure it
			will fetch a handsome price on the
			Romulan market.
			But before that can happen, we need
			to regain access to your central
			computer.
			You don't really think I'm going
			to help you.
			I think... that the mines on Ligos
			Seven can be very hazardous.
			How many people in your crew?
			One thousand, fourteen.
			Very hazardous, Commander.
			Hello. I'm the classroom
			computer system. What can I do
			for you, today?
			Computer, display interior
			security grid.
			I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
			Would you like to play a game?
			No, I would not.
			Computer, display an internal
			schematic diagram.
			I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
			Would you like to see some
			interesting animals?
			It's a child's computer, remember?
			Computer, can you show me a
			picture of the inside of the
			Enterprise?
			The Enterprise is a Galaxy-class
			starship. Do you know how to
			spell Enterprise? E -- N -- T
			-- E --
			Delete audio.
			All right, this will have to
			do... we're here... there's a
			service conduit that runs from
			here to here and then connects
			to a Jeffries Tube here... but
			you and Ensign Ro will still have
			to cross this corridor before you
			can get to Main Engineering.
			Captain...
			Excellent.
			Ready?
			Make it so.
			I'm sorry... Captain.
			Alexander, would you mind if I...
			borrowed your toy for a little
			while?
			Go ahead.
			Thank you.
			He's picked up the toy.
			This is the first time these
			Jeffries tubes haven't seemed
			cramped.
			How much farther do we have to
			go?
			About fifty meters... don't tell
			me you're tired.
			I'm not as young as I used to be.
			This is it. Main Engineering.
			Now we wait.
			Report.
			Mission accomplished, sir. The
			one in Sickbay never saw me.
			Very good.
			I'd say we're ready. Have you
			figured out how to get to the
			Bridge?
			I'm afraid I can only think of
			one way...
			What do you want?
			I need to see my father.
			Go back inside.
			I need to see him right now.
			Do not argue with me. Go back
			inside.
			I need him now! Now! Now! Now!
			You hurt me! I want my father!
			I want my father!
			All right. Just stop that.
			Here he is. Now be quiet!
			What's going on?
			Daddy!
			So... son. How are you?
			I'm okay.
			And what about your friends...
			Keiko and Guinan and Ro?
			They're okay too. But...
			What's wrong?
			We don't have anything to do...
			none of the games are working.
			I know. The Ferengi made Daddy
			turn off the main computer.
			Can't you just turn on the kid's
			computer in Schoolroom Eight?
			We just want to play a few games.
			I don't know if they'll let me
			do that, Jean-Luc, but I'll ask.
			Thanks, Number One.
			He's my Number One Daddy.
			How did it go?
			He understood.
			We should have access very soon.
			Come in.
			I understand your... son was here
			to see you.
			That's right.
			We Ferengi do not bring our
			offspring along with us aboard
			ships.
			Then I suppose that's your loss.
			We consider our families to be
			one of our strengths.
			I think you will find they can
			also be a weakness.
			Unless you release the computer
			to our control, I will execute
			every child on this ship...
			beginning with yours.
			Even you aren't that cruel.
			It is cruel to put children in
			danger by bringing them aboard
			a starship in the first place.
			All right... all right... just
			don't harm my son.
			You will release the computer and
			show Morta exactly how to use it.
			Computer, release command control
			to this station. Authorization,
			Riker-Omega-Three.
			Command functions restored.
			Okay, Morta. The Enterprise
			computer system is controlled by
			three primary main processing
			cores cross linked with a
			redundant melacortz ramistat and
			fourteen kiloquad interface
			modules. The core elements are
			based on FTL nanoprocessor units
			arranged into twenty-five
			bilateral kelilactirals with
			twenty of those units being slaved
			to the central heisenfram
			terminal.
			You do know what a bilateral
			kelilactiral is, don't you?
			Of course I do, human. I am not
			stupid.
			No, of course not.
			Now this is the isopalavial
			interface which controls the main
			firomactal drive unit.
			Don't touch that, you'll blow up
			the entire firomactal drive.
			What? Wait.
			What is... what is a firomactal?
			Just explain it to me.
			That is the firomactal drive
			unit...
			... it controls the central
			ramistat core and also keeps the
			ontarian manifold within forty
			thousand KRG.
			The command lockout has been
			released... accessing the
			transporter...
			The weapon deactivation program
			is in place... Transporter
			security field standing by...
			We're ready.
			Tag!
			You're it!
			It's working. Your turn.
			Yes?
			I found this in the school room.
			Is it yours?
			That's all of them except for the
			two on the Bridge. Wait here
			until I return.
			Yes, sir.
			... so one more time. The
			ramistat kiloquad capacity is a
			function of the square root of
			the intermix ratio times the sum
			of the plasma injector quotient.
			There's one more.
			Come in. What do you want?
			I believe you're in my chair.
			Captain's Log, Stardate: 46236.3
			We have taken Lurin and his men
			into custody. The Ferengi
			Alliance has quickly disavowed
			any knowledge of these renegades.
			With the mining operation
			closed and our crew back on
			board, we can now turn our
			attention to other problems.
			Phase inducers activated...
			energy levels nominal...
			I'm loading the adult patterns
			into the buffer...
			Transposition matrix locked
			in...
			Energize...
			How do you feel, Captain?
			I feel fine. Everything just
			seems... smaller.
			It's my mother.
			The funny thing is... I never
			really drew a picture of her when
			I was young... but for some reason
			I wanted to now.
			That's the wonderful thing about
			crayons... when you're a child,
			they can take you to more places
			than a starship.
			It's my turn, isn't it?
			Only if you're ready.
			It's not quite as bad as I
			remembered it... being a child,
			I mean.
			We better get going.
			There's no hurry. The Transporter
			will still be there... pass me
			the burnt umber.
