			Get the stasis units in here and
			bring them on-line.
			Tell Doctor Selar to use ward
			three for the ambulatory cases,
			I'll take the --
			Transporter Room Four to Sickbay.
			They're coming in now.
			Acknowledged.
			Back everyone.
			What happened?
			The Lenarians attacked us outside
			the conference room.
			He's in cardiac arrest.
			Get the pulmonary support unit.
			Internal hemorrhaging... the bioregulator
			in his artificial
			heart's been fused... damage to
			the spleen and liver... what kind
			of weapon did this?
			A compressed teryon beam.
			Forty cc's inoprovaline...
			Activity in the isocortex is
			falling. Cortical stimulator.
			Now.
			Again.
			Welcome to the afterlife, Jean-Luc.
			You're dead.
			What's going on, Q?
			I told you. You're dead. This is
			the afterlife. And I'm God.
			You are not God.
			Blasphemy! You're lucky I don't
			cast you out, or smite you or
			something.
			I don't know what game it is
			you're playing, but I am not going
			to participate.
			What an ego.
			Did you think the great Jean-Luc
			Picard would never die?
			Q, whatever you've done to --
			I haven't done anything.
			Check your heart rate. Go ahead.
			No pulse? What a surprise.
			How do I know this isn't another
			one of your tricks?
			Think, Jean-Luc. Why would I go
			to all the trouble of faking your
			death when I could simply kill you
			whenever I felt like it?
			Is that what happened?
			I wouldn't want to steal the
			credit... it was a rather
			disgruntled Lenarian actually.
			The conference...
			Yes, yes. The conference, the
			unexpected attack, the compressed
			teryon beam... the bottom line is,
			your life ended about five minutes
			ago under the inept ministrations
			of Doctor Beverly Crusher.
			No. I am not dead. I refuse to
			believe there is an afterlife
			which is run by you.
			The universe is not that badly
			designed.
			Very well. If you really require
			more evidence of your post-mortem
			status, I'll just have to provide
			some...
			Jean-Luc...
			Father...
			I told you not to go running off
			to that Academy. I told you that
			Starfleet would bring you to a bad
			end. But you wouldn't listen.
			Now look at you... dead before
			your time.
			All right, Q... enough.
			Enough what?
			Why couldn't you listen? Didn't
			you understand that I was only
			looking out for your best
			interests?
			Q, stop this.
			Even now, after all these years...
			you still manage to disappoint me,
			Jean-Luc.
			I hope you're enjoying this, Q.
			This isn't for me. This is for
			you, Jean-Luc... I wanted to give
			you an opportunity to make peace
			with your sordid past.
			I find it hard to believe that
			you're doing this for the benefit
			of my soul.
			Now that you've finally shuffled
			off the mortal coil, we're free to
			spend some time together. I
			simply want you to be at peace
			with yourself.
			"Some time together?"... how much
			time?
			Eternity.
			So I'm in hell.
			That's the spirit, Jean-Luc.
			Don't let a little thing like
			death slow down that rapier wit.
			Now you're sure you don't have any
			regrets or feelings of guilt about
			your former life? I can't have
			you whining and complaining
			through eternity.
			If I'm truly dead, then my only
			regret is dying... and finding you
			here.
			You wound me, Mon Capitain. After
			all, I wasn't the cause of your
			death...
			... this was.
			Is that...
			Your artificial heart.
			You might have lived if you'd had
			a real heart instead of this
			unreliable piece of technology.
			How did you manage to lose yours
			anyway?
			It was a... mistake.
			Something you regret?
			I regret a great many things from
			those days...
			Really?
			It wasn't very smart of you to
			take on three Nausicaans like
			that.
			No, it wasn't.
			And did I hear you laugh? It's so
			unlike you to have a sense of
			humor... especially about getting
			stabbed through the back.
			I was... a different person in
			those days... an arrogant,
			undisciplined, young man with far
			too much ego and far too little
			wisdom.
			I was more like you.
			I'm sure you were far more
			interesting in those days. A pity
			you had to change.
			The only pity is that I had to be
			impaled through the back before I
			learned my lesson.
			I started that fight with the
			Nausicaans... I started it
			because I was young and cocky...
			If I had been more responsible at
			that age... I wouldn't have needed
			this heart... and I wouldn't have
			died from a random energy surge
			thirty years later.
			So if you had it to do all over
			again... ?
			Things would be different...
			Bravo! Bravo!
			Nicely done.
			Cortan? Cortan Zweller?
			Of course it's me... boy, she
			must've hit you pretty hard.
			You're slowing down, Johnny. You
			should've seen that one coming.
			Marta...
			Are you okay?
			I'm... just a little
			disoriented...
			Oh, please. Now he's just playing
			for sympathy.
			I want to get something to eat and
			head over to the casino at
			Bonestell. Who's coming?
			I'll... catch up with you later.
			Are you sure you're all right?
			No, no. I'm fine Marta -- Marty,
			really.
			Come on, Marty. I bet he has
			another date anyway.
			That's it, isn't it?
			You are incorrigible.
			Try not to end up in the hospital.
			Attention on deck, Ensign Picard!
			Q...
			That's Captain Q to you, young
			man.
			What's the point of creating
			this... fantasy?
			It's no fantasy. This is all very
			real, I assure you. You're twenty-one
			years old again... a brash
			young man, fresh out of the
			Academy.
			I don't look it.
			To everyone else, you do.
			I thought you said I was dead...
			now you tell me I'm alive?
			You mortals can be so obtuse. Why
			do you persist in believing that
			life and death are such static and
			rigid concepts.
			I can take your life and then give
			it back to you with the snap of a
			finger.
			Let's say for the moment that it's
			true... what purpose does it serve
			to bring me here?
			You said you regretted a great
			many things from this time in your
			life. Well, now you have a chance
			to change some of them.
			Change. You mean change the past.
			Q, even if you have brought me
			back in time somehow... surely you
			must realize that any alteration
			in this timeline could have a
			profound impact on the future --
			Spare me your egotistical musings
			on your pivotal role in history.
			Nothing you do here will cause the
			Federation to collapse or the
			galaxy to explode. To be blunt...
			you're not that important.
			I won't do it. I won't alter
			history.
			Oh, very well... if you attach so
			much importance to the continuity
			of time... I can personally
			guarantee that nothing you do here
			will end up hurting anyone, or
			have an adverse affect on what you
			know as history. The only thing
			at stake here is your life and
			your peace of mind.
			You have my word.
			It's bad form to laugh at one's
			god. Whether you believe me or
			not, you're here and you have a
			second chance... what you do with
			it is entirely up to you.
			Do you know where you are?
			Starbase Earhart... we came here
			just after graduation... to wait
			for our first deep space
			assignments.
			That's right. It's two days
			before your unfortunate encounter
			with a Nausicaan sword... you have
			that long to make whatever changes
			you wish. If you can avoid
			getting stabbed through the heart
			this time -- which I doubt -- I'll
			take you back to what you think of
			as the present and you can go on
			with your life... with a real
			heart.
			So then I won't die?
			Of course you'll die. It'll just
			be at a later time.
			What if I don't avoid the fight...
			what if I don't make any changes?
			Then you die on the table and we
			spend eternity together.
			Wonderful.
			I'm glad you think so.
			I am curious about one thing...
			Johnny, why did that rather
			attractive woman slap you just
			now? Something you said?
			Picard thinks back, trying to remember.
			That woman's name was... Corlina.
			I was supposed to take her to
			dinner... on this night...
			But then she found out that...
			I'd made a second date with
			another woman... named Penny.
			Corlina was... somewhat upset.
			I'm impressed. I had no idea you
			could be such a cad.
			Computer, what time is it?
			Sixteen eleven hours.
			In fact, Penny should be...
			waiting for me... right now.
			You're awfully quiet today. What
			happened to the dashing young
			Ensign from last night... the one
			with the winning smile and the
			smooth talk about my eyes?
			Nothing. I'm just a little
			more... contemplative.
			And what are you contemplating?
			Penny, perhaps we could just...
			talk for a while. I don't know
			anything about you... where you
			come from... what your interests
			are... your last name...
			I come from Rigel, my last name is
			Muroc and I like men in uniform.
			I think that's enough talk.
			Penny... I don't think it would be
			fair... to you to pretend that I'm
			really interested in a...
			relationship right now...
			Who said anything about a
			relationship?
			What's wrong... Don't I look as
			attractive as I did last night?
			What? No, not at all. You're a
			very... handsome woman.
			Handsome... that's something you
			say to old ladies.
			Penny. To me you are definitely
			not an old lady.
			I wasn't after your pity.
			Penny for your thoughts?
			You never told me you were such a
			lady's man.
			I was a puerile adolescent who let
			himself be ruled by his hormones
			instead of his head.
			It seems your friends know how to
			have a good time. Maybe you
			should go take some lessons.
			Hey, you! Get over here with
			those drinks before I tear your
			head off!
			Excuse me.
			Are you addressing me... ?
			He's winning.
			Of course.
			I thought you had a date.
			She... decided to leave.
			You're getting old, Johnny.
			Thank you... thank you all...
			Very nice... forget about
			Starfleet and just play Dom-Jot
			for a living.
			This is nothing... it's just a
			little trigonometry, and some
			minor wrist action. Barokie --
			now there's a game.
			Human!
			Play Dom-Jot... Human?
			I think I could be persuaded to
			play one more game.
			No, don't play him.
			Why?
			It'll cause trouble.
			He's a Nausicaan... they can be
			very ill-tempered when they lose.
			So can I.
			Corey, listen to me. This is a
			bad idea. Don't play him.
			What's gotten into you?
			Let's go.
			I see you've found your Nausicaan
			friend.
			You seem un-impaled so far.
			Sorry to disappoint you.
			Ensign Zweller seems to be doing
			well.
			He's going to lose. The Nausicaan
			is cheating.
			Really? I'm beginning to like
			these Nausicaans.
			If history repeats itself, Corey
			will figure it out later tonight
			and then he'll want revenge.
			And will you help your best friend
			avenge this injustice?
			I did the first time. I found a
			way to rig the table so that Corey
			could win in a rematch.
			You? Cheated? Picard, I'm
			impressed.
			It was a foolish mistake. The
			Nausicaan and his two friends
			didn't take the loss very well.
			They were outraged... they wanted
			a fight...
			And I gave them one.
			A beautiful story...
			Gets you right here doesn't it?
			Dom-Jot!
			Human play Dom-Jot!
			I've played a lot of Dom-Jot, in
			a lot of places, and I've never
			seen the balls roll that well for
			anyone. Did you see the way he
			rolled the terik into straight
			nines? That's a one in a million
			shot and he did it twice.
			So he was cheating...
			It may have simply been
			extraordinary luck.
			I was watching the way he held the
			cue. Every time he needed to make
			a tough shot, he held the cue
			close to his waist. I think he
			had some kind of magnetic device
			in his belt. It must've been
			controlling the balls.
			That's terrible.
			We have to get even.
			What do you have in mind?
			We could do the same thing to him
			that he did to us. Cheat. We'll
			rig the table so his device will
			backfire on him.
			That won't solve anything.
			It'll teach him that he can't go
			around cheating Starfleet
			Officers.
			What it will do is provoke him.
			And provoking a Nausicaan is not
			a good idea.
			I can handle him.
			What if he's not alone... what if
			he brings some friends along next
			time?
			Well... then I guess I'll have to
			depend on my friends to help me
			out.
			Corey... there must be a better
			way to handle this...
			When did you start backing away
			from a good fight?
			We're not cadets anymore... we're
			officers. We have to start...
			setting a higher standard for
			ourselves.
			Maybe he's right... maybe this
			isn't such a good idea.
			Look, we've only got one more day
			before we all have to report to
			our ships. Let's have one last
			adventure together... we may not
			see each other again for a long
			time.
			No. I'm sorry Corey, but I won't
			do it.
			It was a good idea, Corey... but
			let's just forget about it...
			He'll get over it.
			I hope so.
			What?
			Nothing... it's just that usually
			you'd be the one plotting revenge.
			That would be more in character,
			wouldn't it?
			Much.
			But I always suspected you had a
			hidden streak of responsibility
			somewhere.
			Maybe I'm just getting... a little
			older.
			Maybe these bars are starting to
			feel a little heavy, Ensign.
			Ensign Picard and Ensign
			Batanides... sounds weird,
			doesn't it?
			It's going to take some getting
			used to.
			It's too bad we can't get used to
			it together.
			The -- the three of us, I mean.
			Of course.
			Come.
			Is there a John-Luck Pickard here?
			From one of your conquests, no
			doubt. I guess some things aren't
			going to change.
			Did I interrupt something sordid
			I hope?
			No, you did not.
			Pity. She's quite attractive.
			We were friends, nothing more.
			Is that another regret I hear?
			My, my... we're simply riddled
			with regrets about our youth,
			aren't we?
			My friendship with Marta is not
			something I regret.
			But you do wish you'd been more
			than just... friends, don't you?
			Well... here's your chance to
			change all that.
			What do you want, Q?
			I thought you might like to know
			that Mister Zweller has decided to
			ignore your advice.
			He's in the Bonestell Facility
			right now... rigging the table to
			beat the Nausicaan. I guess you
			weren't that persuasive.
			Corey...
			Ow!
			Johnny... don't sneak up on me
			like that. I thought you were the
			gambling foreman.
			Sorry.
			It's all right. I'm glad you're
			here.
			Hand me the magna-spanner.
			I'm not here to help you, I'm here
			to stop you from making a serious
			mistake.
			You sound like my mother.
			Cheating the Nausicaan could have
			serious consequences for all of
			us. It's a risk we can't afford
			to take.
			You are my mother.
			Well, Mom... gee, I guess I'll
			have to go tell the Nausicaans I
			don't mind if they cheat me --
			This isn't a joke, Corey.
			It better be.
			Now, I'm going to finish my work
			here. If you want to help me --
			fine. If you don't, then I'll see
			you back at the Starbase.
			I said you're not doing this.
			Are you going to hit me, Johnny?
			No.
			But I will tell the gambling
			foreman that someone's been
			tampering with his Dom-Jot table.
			All right, have it your way...
			... Ensign Picard.
			I just couldn't make him
			understand.
			At least he did finally give it
			up...
			Yes, but... he didn't take it very
			well.
			Oh, you know Corey... he'll forget
			all about it by tomorrow.
			I hope so. We were friends for
			many years after this.
			Or at least... I hope we will be.
			You keep smiling at me.
			I've just never seen you like this
			before. You're so... serious.
			Do I really seem that different?
			I don't know... maybe I'm just not
			used to seeing you in an officer's
			uniform...
			No... it's more than that... you
			do seem different...
			I mean, I'm not complaining... I
			think it suits you.
			Really?
			Yes. I think it's very...
			... attractive.
			Johnny... have you ever thought
			about us... getting together?
			Actually... I have. For a long
			time.
			Why didn't you ever say so?
			I... don't know.
			At the moment... I can't imagine
			why I didn't...
			Well... you've said it now.
			Good morning, darling.
			A little jumpy this morning, are
			we? Feeling guilty perhaps?
			I don't have anything to feel
			guilty about, Q.
			No?
			"We were friends, Q. Nothing
			more."
			You're the one who gave me the
			opportunity to change things...
			So what happens next?
			I don't know. But I do know that
			things will be different.
			I'm sure.
			Morning.
			Johnny.
			What's wrong?
			Well... this is the morning after,
			huh?
			I suppose so.
			I... don't quite know where to
			begin...
			Marta... I don't regret what
			happened last night... and I hope
			you don't, either.
			I don't know... we've been friends
			for a long time... and now...
			I hope last night has only brought
			us closer.
			Do you remember the first day we
			reported to the Academy?
			Very well.
			They marched us into Scobee Hall
			in our stiff new uniforms... and
			then Admiral Silona gave us the
			old welcome aboard speech.
			He said, I want you all to look to
			the left of you and then look to
			the right of you...
			... One of you isn't going to make
			it through the next four years.
			I remember thinking... that's me.
			I'm not going to make it. Then I
			looked to my right... and there
			you were with this cocky look on
			your face... and you said, "we'll
			see about that." From that
			moment, I knew I wanted you as a
			friend.
			And now... I'm afraid we've ruined
			that friendship.
			Perhaps we should just... pretend
			that this never happened and try
			to...
			I wish I could. It would make it
			easier to say good-bye tomorrow.
			We're all supposed to get together
			later... the last big night on the
			town before we ship out... now I'm
			not sure it's such a good idea...
			I don't want you to do anything
			that'll be uncomfortable...
			I'll be there. We planned this...
			I don't want to disappoint Corey.
			Let's see... in the past twenty-four
			hours, you've managed to get
			slapped by one woman, have a drink
			thrown in your face by another,
			and alienate your two best
			friends. I'd say you're doing
			quite nicely so far.
			Just one more thing to do... avoid
			getting stabbed through the heart
			tonight.
			I think you'll like serving aboard
			the Ajax... I understand Captain
			Narth is an excellent officer.
			So I hear.
			Well... here's to the class of
			'twenty-seven.
			Play Dom-Jot, Human? Give you a
			better chance.
			Give you a bigger stick maybe.
			I don't think we're interested.
			They are Undari.
			Cowards.
			What did you say?
			Coward. Like all Starfleet. You
			talk and you talk... but you have
			no guramba.
			Why don't we find out --
			Don't be a fool.
			There are plenty of other people
			to play Dom-Jot. Go on about your
			business.
			Maybe I play with you... give you
			a good time.
			Orcho lok resnik Starfleet...
			You've done enough.
			Corey, I'm sorry. He was drawing
			a weapon...
			I don't know who you are
			anymore... but you're not my
			friend.
			Good-bye, Johnny.
			Congratulations, Mon Capitain.
			You did it.
			Can I help you?
			Can I help you, Mister Picard?
			Worf...
			This is not for me. You should
			take it to Commander La Forge in
			Engineering.
			What's happened... ?
			Is something wrong?
			I'm not sure...
			Mister Worf, what's my rank and
			position?
			You are a Lieutenant junior
			grade... the assistant
			astrophysics officer.
			Are you feeling all right?
			Who's the Captain of this ship?
			Captain Thomas Halloway.
			Perhaps I should escort you to
			Sickbay.
			No. I think I can find my way.
			Thank you, Commander.
			Beverly, something's happened to
			me. I'm not sure --
			Vhat seems to be de trouble,
			Lieutenant Picard?
			Q, what have you done?
			I've done exactly what I promised,
			Jean-Luc. I've returned you to
			the present.
			This is not the present I
			remember. You said nothing would
			change.
			And nothing has changed... except
			for you. But then, that's what
			you wanted, wasn't it? To change
			the man you were in your youth?
			Well, you did it -- and this is
			the man you are today.
			You should be happy... you have a
			real heart beating in your chest
			and you get to live out the rest
			of your life in safety... running
			tests... making analyses... and
			carrying reports to your
			superiors.
			... so tell Duffy that we'll need
			to adjust the main deflector later
			this afternoon. Oh, and have him
			look into that inducer problem.
			Hi, Jean-Luc. What's new in
			astrophysics?
			Do you need something?
			I have the... spectral analysis
			for you.
			Thanks.
			Lynch, try shunting the power
			through the lateral conduit.
			So where's the problem... ?
			What's going on?
			Oh, something's causing a power
			spike in the starboard warp coil.
			If I don't track it down soon, the
			Captain's going to have my head on
			a platter.
			Have you tried flushing the
			transfer conduits with trioxina?
			No.
			The conduits sometimes get blocked
			by neutrino emissions when the
			plasma --
			Hey... I know you're trying to
			make full Lieutenant this year...
			but I think we can handle this
			from here.
			Am I interrupting?
			Not at all. Have a seat.
			I wonder if I could talk with you
			for a moment... about my future on
			the Enterprise.
			Of course, Lieutenant. Jean-Luc,
			isn't it?
			Maybe I should go.
			No, please Counselor... I would
			very much like to hear your
			thoughts...
			First of all... I'd like you to be
			straightforward with me. How do
			you evaluate me as an officer?
			Your performance reports have
			always been good. You're
			thorough... dedicated...
			Reliable, steady...
			...punctual.
			I see.
			What would you say if I told you
			I thought I was capable of being
			more than that...
			Maybe we should discuss this at
			your next evaluation...
			I'd very much appreciate it if we
			could discuss it now.
			I would like to try... to move
			beyond astrophysics... into
			engineering or security perhaps.
			Something which might even lead to
			a command.
			Frankly, Lieutenant... I don't
			think that's realistic...
			Why?
			I really don't think this is the
			place to be discussing --
			Please. This is important to me.
			I know I can do more.
			Hasn't this been the problem all
			along? Throughout your career...
			you've had lofty goals... but
			you've never been willing to do
			what's necessary to attain them.
			Would that be your evaluation as
			well, Commander?
			I'd have to agree with the
			Counselor. You talk about wanting
			more... but when it comes to doing
			something about it, you hang back.
			If you want to get ahead, you have
			to take chances... stand out from
			the crowd... get noticed.
			I see.
			We don't want to lose you...
			you're a good officer.
			Just not -- one who stands out.
			Look... why don't I talk to
			Commander La Forge... maybe
			there's something in Engineering.
			But... command?
			Well... we'll see.
			Senior officers please report to
			the Captain's Ready Room.
			Acknowledged.
			I think we should talk about this
			later.
			All right, Q. Enough of this.
			You've made your point.
			Q... ?
			La Forge to Lieutenant Picard.
			I'm still waiting for your final
			sensor usage log.
			I'm on my way, sir.
			Main Engineering.
			Are you having a good laugh now,
			Q? Does it amuse you to think of
			me living out the rest of my life
			as a dreary man in a tedious job?
			I gave you something most mortals
			never experience... a second
			chance at life. And now all you
			can do is complain?
			I can't live out my days as that
			person. That man is bereft of
			passion and imagination. That's
			not who I am.
			Au contraire. He's the person you
			wanted to be... one who was less
			arrogant, and undisciplined as a
			youth.
			One who was less like me.
			The Jean-Luc Picard you wanted to
			be, the one who did not fight the
			Nausicaan, had quite a different
			career from the one you remember.
			That Picard never had a brush with
			death... never came face to face
			with his own mortality... never
			realized how fragile life is...
			how important each moment can
			be... so his life never came into
			focus. He drifted through much of
			his career, with no plan or
			agenda... going from one
			assignment to the next, never
			seizing the opportunities that

			He didn't lead the Away Team on
			Milika Three to save that
			ambassador... he didn't take
			charge of the Stargazer's Bridge
			when its Captain was killed...
			and no one ever offered him a
			command.
			He learned to play it safe. And
			he never, ever got noticed by
			anyone.
			You're right. You gave me the
			chance to change and I took that
			opportunity. But I freely admit
			now that it was a mistake.
			Are you asking me for something,
			Jean-Luc?
			Yes.
			Give me a chance to put things
			back to the way they were before.
			Before, you died in Sickbay. Is
			that what you want?
			I would rather die as the man I
			was... than live the life I just
			saw.
			Please.
			Coward. Like all Starfleet. You
			talk and you talk... but you have
			no guramba.
			What did you say?
			I said you are a coward.
			That's what I thought you said.
			His vital signs are stabilizing...
			Captain... ? Jean-Luc... ?
			You've been injured... but I think
			it's going to be all right.
			... I still don't know what to make
			of it all. Was it a dream? Or
			one of Q's elaborate tricks?
			A lot of people who've been near
			death have talked about strange
			experiences... but they're not
			usually so detailed.
			Part of me cannot accept the idea
			that Q would have given me a
			second chance... that he would
			demonstrate that much...
			compassion.
			But if it was Q... I owe him a
			debt of gratitude.
			In what sense? It sounds like he
			put you through hell.
			There were many things in my youth
			that I'm not proud of... they were
			loose threads... untidy parts of
			myself that I wanted to remove.
			But when I pulled on one of those
			threads... I unravelled the
			tapestry of my life.
			I was just trying to imagine you
			as a hell-bent-for-leather young
			officer insulting a Nausicaan
			twice your size. I wish I'd
			gotten a chance to meet that Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			Well, to tell the truth... that
			wasn't the first time I'd had a
			run-in with a couple of surly
			Nausicaans...
			Really?
			Oh, yes...
			During my sophomore year I was
			assigned to do some training on
			Morikin Seven. Well, there was a
			Nausicaan outpost on one of the
			outlying asteroids...
