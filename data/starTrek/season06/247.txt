			You're absolutely right, Doctor.
			In fact, right now it's hard to
			imagine ever hurting anyone...
			How do you feel about that person
			you used to be?
			I feel... terrible. But thanks to
			you, I'm much better now. And I
			feel confident that when I leave,
			I'll be ready to take my place in
			society again.
			When do you think that will be?
			Well... now. Right away.
			What makes you say that?
			You said when I was able to accept
			what I'd done, and understood the
			consequences of my actions, that
			I'd be free to go.
			"Free to go." Are you saying you
			don't think you should stand trial
			for what you've done?
			I'm looking forward to proving my
			innocence...
			I thought you said you accepted
			what you'd done.
			But that's not what I meant. I...
			I meant that I was sick when it
			happened. I wasn't responsible
			for what I did...
			How do I know that you're not just
			telling me what I want to hear?
			Perhaps we should continue this
			discussion next week...
			No. I want to talk about it
			now...
			You're starting to sound angry
			again. Maybe you need another
			treatment...
			What I need is to get out of this
			cell. I'm locked up day and
			night... you control every
			move... tell me what to eat, what
			to think, what to say...
			And when I show a glimmer of
			independent thought, you strap me
			down, inject me with drugs and
			call it a "treatment."
			You're becoming agitated...
			You bet I'm agitated! I may be
			surrounded by insanity, but I'm
			not insane. And I won't let you
			or anyone... me think I am....
			I won't let you or anyone think
			that...
			I'm sorry. Can we take it from
			"You're becoming agitated"?
			Why don't we break for tonight.
			I think we've made a lot of
			progress.
			But I'm still not confident about
			that final speech...
			There's such a thing as over-rehearsing,
			Wil. You'll do just
			fine.
			Try to relax. You're resisting
			the character. Let yourself feel
			what he's feeling.
			Maybe I'm just not right for this
			part...
			Most humanoids have the potential
			to be irrational. Perhaps you
			should attempt to access that part
			of your psyche.
			Haven't you ever felt at odds with
			everyone -- like the whole world
			was against you?
			Yeah... my first year at the
			Academy...
			Try to tap into that feeling.
			That's what your character is
			going through in this scene.
			I'll work on it...
			It'll be wonderful. You're going
			to knock 'em dead.
			"You control every move... tell me
			what to eat, what to think, what
			to say... "
			"What to eat, what to think, what
			to say... "
			"And when I show a glimmer of
			independent thought, you strap me
			down, inject me with drugs and
			call it a 'treatment'... "
			"I may be surrounded by insanity,
			but I'm not insane --"
			Excuse me...
			Tilonus Four? Didn't their
			government just collapse?
			It's in a state of total anarchy.
			When the Prime Minister was
			assassinated, a Federation
			research team was on the planet.
			It is believed they were forced to
			go into hiding...
			Your mission will be to locate and
			evacuate them.
			Can't they go to local
			authorities?
			There are no local authorities.
			The government's been splintered --
			several factions are vying for
			power. And they're desperate for
			weapons or technology of any
			kind...
			Apparently, some factions are
			resorting to torture to gather
			information. A Starfleet research
			team would be a prime target.
			Then I'll have to go alone...
			undercover.
			Agreed. Mister Worf is ready to
			give you a detailed briefing on
			Tilonian culture.
			Looks like I'll have to back out
			of Doctor Crusher's play after
			all...
			No, no... you'll have plenty of
			time for that, Number One. We
			won't be arriving at Tilonus for
			another five days.
			Besides, if you back out now,
			Beverly will come after me to play
			the part.
			This is the last known location of
			the research team. They had
			occupied a small building in the
			Southwest quarter of the city.
			You will begin your search there.
			The Southwest quarter covers over
			two hundred square kilometers.
			That's a lot of ground for one man
			to cover...
			I'd better pack an extra pair of
			boots.
			This apparel will allow you to
			pass as a common merchant.
			This Tilonian pendant has been
			equipped with a communicator
			circuit.
			It doesn't really match the
			outfit...
			I suggest you pay closer
			attention, Commander. Your life
			will be at stake.
			Do you understand what I am
			saying?
			Yes... of course I do...
			Because you will be posing as a
			merchant, you will need to know
			how to use the Nisroh for the
			traditional bartering ceremony.
			You will be judged on your prowess
			with the blade...
			I am sorry, Commander! I did not
			intend --
			That's okay, that's okay...
			I guess I really wasn't paying
			attention...
			I'd better get to Sickbay. We'll
			pick this up later.
			Aye sir...
			You'll do anything to get out of
			this play, won't you?
			Well, you're going to have to do
			better than this...
			The play's tomorrow night. I've
			still got twenty-four hours left.
			Don't get any ideas. I'll expect
			you on stage at eighteen hundred
			hours.
			Right...
			It still hurts...
			There's no nerve damage... you
			shouldn't be feeling any pain.
			Probably just a symptom of stage
			fright --
			He was working on a conduit on
			Deck Thirty-seven. A plasma torch
			blew up in his hands...
			It hurts! Oh God -- it hurts!
			I've been on a lot of missions...
			and I've seen a lot of people get
			injured...
			But I've never been affected like
			this...
			He was looking right at me.
			And that was disturbing to you...
			It was like he was... blaming me
			or something. But it's more than
			just this one incident. For the
			past few days, I've been feeling
			like everyone's staring at me...
			or talking about me...
			I feel like I'm in "Frame of
			Mind"...
			"Frame of Mind"?
			Doctor Crusher's play. Ever since
			I started rehearsing the role,
			I've been feeling a little
			restless... uneasy...
			You're probably drawing on
			feelings that you're not used to
			expressing...
			Yeah. The play is full of
			disturbing images. People losing
			their minds... being tortured by
			doctors...
			I can't get it out of my head...
			Sometimes it's healthy to explore
			the darker sides of the psyche.
			Jung called it "owning your own
			shadow."
			This could be a sign that you're
			a real actor, Wil. It's becoming
			more than just a role to you.
			Maybe you're right...
			Don't be afraid of your darker
			side. Have fun with it.
			Who is that?
			You just missed him.
			Do we have a new Lieutenant on
			board?
			I'm not sure. Do you want me to
			check the personnel logs?
			No... I'll check them tomorrow...
			I think I'll get to bed early.
			Tomorrow's the performance and I
			want to be up for it.
			I'm looking forward to it.
			Break a leg.
			I'll try not to take that
			literally.
			Perhaps we should continue this
			discussion next week...
			No. I want to talk about it
			now...
			You're starting to sound angry
			again. Maybe you need another
			treatment...
			What I need is to get out of this
			cell. I'm locked up day and
			night... you control every
			move... tell me what to eat, what
			to think, what to say...
			And when I show a glimmer of
			independent thought, you strap me
			down, inject me with drugs and
			call it a "treatment."
			You're becoming agitated...
			You bet I'm agitated! I may be
			surrounded by insanity, but I'm
			not insane. And I won't let you
			or anyone else tell me I am.
			You can destroy my mind, but you
			can't change the truth. I didn't
			kill that man.
			And that's what's driving you
			crazy...
			I can see we have a lot of work to
			do.
			No matter what you do, you can't
			change the fact that I'm innocent!
			I'm not crazy!
			I'm not crazy...
			I'm... not...
			...crazy.
			I can see we have a lot of work to
			do.
			Where am I?
			How did you get me off the ship?
			The ship again...
			What's going on?
			I understand this must be very
			disturbing for you. But try to
			relax.
			Tell me. Where were you a moment
			ago?
			I was on the Enterprise. In the
			middle of a play...
			Here... but it wasn't real... it
			was a stage...
			I can assure you this is not a
			stage.
			Do you remember your name?
			I'm Commander...
			Commander...
			I knew who I was a second ago...
			I was on the ship... in a play...
			It's getting harder to remember...
			That's good. You're starting to
			come out of your delusional state.
			Delusion... it couldn't be a
			delusion. I was there...
			We've discussed this. Do you
			remember when we contacted
			Starfleet... and asked them about
			you?
			No...
			We spoke with Admiral Budrow. On
			Starbase...
			... Starbase Twenty-nine.
			He said he'd never heard of me...
			that they had no officer matching
			my description...
			That's right. Now. Focus on who
			I am. Do you remember me?
			I'm not sure...
			I'm Doctor Syrus.
			Do you remember anything about
			where you are now?
			I hurt my head... somebody hit
			me...
			You tried to escape. You
			struggled with one of the
			attendants and hit your head on a
			door. Do you remember that?
			Yes... now I do. But at first, I
			thought a Klingon cut me... with
			a knife...
			It's called transposition. You're
			projecting elements from your
			delusions onto events that really
			happened.
			But that's good. There was a time
			when you couldn't break away from
			your Starship fantasy at all.
			If what you're saying is true...
			where am I?
			You're in Ward Forty-seven of the
			Tilonus Institute for Mental
			Disorders.
			Why am I here?
			We'll talk more later. You don't
			have to remember everything today.
			You're making excellent progress.
			Wait...
			Good afternoon. I've got some
			good news for you.
			Doctor Syrus suggested that you
			might enjoy a couple of hours in
			the Common Area today.
			Well?
			I guess so...
			I hope you're hungry. They're
			serving spiny lobe-fish today.
			There's no need for this.
			That's what you said the last
			time.
			I'll be back with your lunch.
			I hear you're a Starfleet
			officer...
			I'm Commander Bloom from the
			Yorktown...
			There are at least a dozen of us
			here... maybe more...
			We were kidnapped... brought here
			against our will...
			Sanders was on the Yosemite. They
			did something to his mind. I
			think they're trying to get neuro
			chemicals from our brains...
			Stafko was with me on the
			Yorktown. I don't know what they
			did to him...
			We're going to get out of here.
			I've made a communicator...
			You have?
			Yes. There are three Starships in
			orbit. They're going to beam us
			out of here any day now...
			I'll tell them to get you out,
			too...
			Lieutenant Bloom to Yorktown...
			come in Yorktown. I've made
			contact with another officer...
			Talking to your Starship again,
			Jaya?
			No.
			Don't let them tell you you're
			crazy.
			You know you're not supposed to
			take utensils from the Common
			Area.
			You're welcome to try it.
			I'm not that far gone, am I?
			Of course you are. Last week you
			held an entire conversation with
			a chair, remember?
			No...
			Where's your sense of humor? If
			you ever want to get better,
			you've got to relax.
			Your name -- it's Mav... Mavek.
			That's right. Not bad for a crazy
			man.
			I'm starting to remember certain
			things, but...
			Why am I here?
			I remember when they brought you
			in. You were screaming...
			struggling...
			We could barely hold you down. In
			fact, just getting the blood off
			your hands took over an hour.
			Blood?
			On your hands... your clothes...
			You didn't just kill that man...
			you mutilated him.
			What are you talking about? I
			didn't kill anybody.
			I'm afraid you did. You stabbed
			him. They found you near the
			body... with the knife in your
			hand...
			No. It's not true...
			Yes it is. And if you get out of
			here, you're going to stand
			trial...
			You're lying!
			I imagine the punishment will be
			quite severe... considering you
			stabbed him nine times --
			NO!
			I was there... in Ward Forty-seven,
			just like in the play.
			Everyone thought I was insane...
			that I'd killed somebody...
			Except it was all real.
			Deanna mentioned you went to bed
			early because you felt a little
			anxious about the play. But I had
			no idea...
			You said that in your dream we
			performed the play...
			How'd it go?
			It was a smash. We got a standing
			ovation.
			Let's hope it goes that well
			tonight.
			We've got one hour to curtain.
			How do you feel?
			I feel... like an actor.
			You're certainly starting to look
			the part.
			Perhaps we should continue this
			discussion next week...
			No. I want to talk about it
			now...
			You're starting to sound angry
			again. Maybe you need another
			treatment...
			What I need is to get out of this
			cell. I'm locked up day and
			night... you control my every
			move...
			You tell me what to eat... what to
			think... what to say...
			"And when I show a glimmer of
			independent thought... "
			And when I show a glimmer of
			independent thought, you strap me
			down, inject me with drugs and
			call it a "treatment."
			You're becoming agitated...
			You bet I'm agitated! I may be
			surrounded by insanity, but I'm
			not insane. And I won't let you
			or anyone else tell me...
			What's happening...
			I can see we have a lot of work to
			do.
			No matter what you do, you can't
			change the fact that I'm
			innocent...
			You're the key to all this, aren't
			you? Who are you?
			Who are you?
			Lieutenant Suna, sir...
			Wil... are you alright?
			No... I don't know...
			Why don't we go down to Sickbay...
			There's nothing wrong with you
			neurologically. I don't see
			anything that could've caused your
			hallucinations.
			But your heart rate is up... blood
			pressure's way above normal.
			You're physically exhausted.
			This is more than just fatigue...
			It's possible under conditions of
			extreme stress for the mind to
			manufacture all kinds of things.
			Drugs. They injected me with me
			drugs...
			Are there drugs in my system?
			Nothing.
			It's that dream... they gave me
			drugs in the dream...
			Did anybody in the theater see
			anything strange happen during the
			performance?
			No... nobody.
			Get some rest, Wil. The play is
			over. Don't give it another
			thought.
			Thanks...
			How's Lieutenant Suna?
			A little shaken... but alright.
			I feel like such an idiot.
			It's nothing to be embarrassed
			about. We're your friends... We
			all know the stress you've been
			under. I'm sure everyone
			understands perfectly...
			Commander, I must compliment you
			on your performance this evening.
			Oh?
			Your unexpected choice to
			improvise was an effective method
			of drawing the audience into the
			plight of your character.
			You gave a truly realistic
			interpretation of multi-infarct
			dementia.
			Thank you.
			Well... maybe not everyone
			understands.
			I guess all I need is a little
			rest... clear my mind a little...
			I want you to try a few relaxation
			techniques, as well. Remember the
			ones I showed you a few months
			ago?
			Yeah... but they didn't seem to
			work for me.
			Maybe you need another treatment.
			What's wrong?
			Nothing... nothing...
			Get some sleep, Wil. I'll see you
			tomorrow.
			It's not real... not real...
			Don't let them tell you you're
			crazy.
			No... NO! Let me out of here!
			No! Let me out of here! Help
			me...
			I need help. I don't want to be
			at the mercy of these
			hallucinations any more.
			So you've accepted that you're not
			from a starship... and that it's
			all a delusion?
			All I know is that whenever I go
			back to the ship, reality starts
			to break apart... nothing makes
			sense. And when it's over, it
			fades away... like a dream...
			But the hospital... everything
			here seems real. I can always
			remember what happens here...
			And what about how you got here?
			Maybe I did kill someone. I don't
			know. But I want to find out.
			I'm glad to hear you say that.
			Because I just had a long talk
			with the hospital Administrator.
			He told me there are certain legal
			questions that have to be resolved
			relatively soon.
			Meaning?
			Meaning we can't keep you here
			much longer. We're the only
			mental health facility on Tilonus
			Four. There are many people who
			need our help...
			I don't want to put any undue
			stress on you... but we have to
			settle this case one way or
			another within the next few days.
			What does that mean?
			You're facing a choice. We can
			try to help you remember what
			happened using Reflection Therapy.
			If it's successful, you would be
			fit to stand trial.
			Reflection Therapy?
			It's a way for you to interact
			with various facets of your
			personality. We scan the regions
			of your brain that control
			emotions and memory... then
			project them holographically.
			What's the other option?
			A complete synaptic reconstruction
			of your cerebral cortex.
			Surgery?
			We would neutralize the synaptic
			pathways responsible for your
			mental instability.
			You don't seem to like that
			option.
			I don't. The procedure is
			irreversible. You'd be left with
			a completely altered personality.
			The person you are now would cease
			to exist.
			Option one is starting to sound
			better...
			I agree.
			Reflection Therapy then... when do
			we start?
			This afternoon, if you're ready.
			I want you to understand this
			isn't going to be easy. You'll be
			interacting with aspects of your
			psyche that you've never dealt
			with before.
			And you may be disturbed by what
			they have to say.
			Close your eyes. Try to relax.
			Clear your mind.
			Now. Think back to before you
			came to the hospital. But don't
			try to remember specific
			incidents. Concentrate on how you
			felt...
			I was... afraid...
			Terrified...
			She was on the ship with me...
			That's because she represents an
			aspect of your personality -- and
			there are many parts of you that
			still believe you're on that
			starship.
			Why her?
			I asked you to get in touch with
			your feelings, and this is the
			part of you that responded. Talk
			to her about how you felt before
			you came here...
			You said I was terrified... of
			what?
			I was in a dark place... cold...
			frightened... someone was there...
			Who?
			I felt threatened by them...
			trapped...
			You're doing very well. Let's try
			to find out how you responded to
			these feelings. Try to focus on
			your actions...
			You felt trapped. What did you
			do?
			I was angry. They were attacking
			me... I fought back...
			I felt pain...
			I was injured...
			I began to panic...
			There was a struggle... and I...
			You what? What happened?
			Try to associate your actions and
			emotions with logical thoughts.
			What do you think caused you to
			act and feel this way... ?
			It was dark and cold because... I
			was outdoors... at night... in a
			narrow space...
			I was walking through an alley.
			I felt threatened...
			I was being watched...
			Someone must have followed me into
			the alley. That's why I started
			to walk faster. Then someone
			grabbed me from behind...
			I panicked...
			I tried to fight them off...
			How many of them were there?
			Three. They were humanoid. I
			could only make out one of their
			faces...
			Who was it?
			He was on the ship too... and I
			saw him here in the hospital...
			but I don't know who he is...
			That's Mister Suna -- the hospital
			Administrator. You met him when
			you first arrived.
			What part of me does he represent?
			I don't know...
			Don't believe this, Wil.
			None of it is real. You're still
			with us... on the Enterprise.
			Doctor...
			We're your colleagues. Trust us.
			It's going to be alright...
			Do you have anything to say to
			them?
			You're just... delusions...
			Do not listen to him, Commander.
			He is trying to trick you. You
			are in danger here. Let us help
			you...
			Stop it... please. Leave me
			alone...
			Listen to me, Wil. In all the
			years we've known each other, have
			I ever lied to you?
			You are not real!
			Wil, please --
			NO!
			You've taken a big step today.
			You've finally turned your back on
			those delusions and all that they
			represent.
			We'll continue later.
			It's not real...
			Commander... do you know who I am?
			Do you know where you are?
			If you can't answer, just listen.
			You were on an undercover mission
			to Tilonus Four... something
			happened... we've been told that
			you killed someone. But we don't
			believe that's true...
			We've been in orbit, trying to
			find a way to get you out. But
			there's a security field around
			the hospital that we can't
			penetrate...
			We've been blocked at every turn.
			The hospital Administrator denies
			you're here at all. It's
			beginning to look like some kind
			of a conspiracy...
			I had to come in posing as a
			health official...
			Sit tight. We're going to get you
			out of here.
			Not real...
			Commander.
			Get away from me...
			Commander, you must come with us.
			You are in danger here...
			No.
			Silence...
			Commander, are you --
			Help me! HELP ME!
			Who are you?
			Take them to Security Ward.
			Worf to Enterprise -- the pattern
			enhancer has been activated.
			Three to beam up.
			Acknowledged.
			There's damage to his parietal
			lobe. It's as if someone was
			trying to access his long term
			memory...
			He's still in a state of severe
			neural shock. It'll take him a
			while to recover...
			Number One... do you remember what
			happened?
			You were abducted during your
			mission to Tilonus Four. You were
			taken to a psychiatric hospital...
			My head... why is it still
			bleeding?
			It's minor. Nothing to worry
			about...
			We've done some checking on the
			hospital Administrator...
			... Mister Suna...
			That's right. It appears he's
			involved with one of the rival
			factions. We believe he was
			responsible for what happened to
			you...
			It still hurts...
			It's bleeding again...
			But how? You just healed it...
			Wil, try to calm down...
			This isn't real...
			Wil, what are you doing?
			If I'm right, you're not really
			here... and this isn't a real
			phaser...
			It's all a fantasy, and I'm ending
			it no matter what it takes...
			But what if this isn't a fantasy?
			Are you willing to take that
			chance?
			You're right... I won't. But I've
			got to find out what's real and
			what's not...
			One way or another, this is going
			to end.
			Wil, don't -- !
			How's he progressing?
			He's not responding to the
			Reflection Therapy. His delusions
			are growing more elaborate...
			He broke out of his cell last
			night. We found him running down
			a corridor... claiming people had
			come to take him back to his
			"starship."
			Then I see no other choice...
			We'll have to perform the synaptic
			reconstruction.
			I still have the phaser... why do
			I still have the phaser?
			It's not a phaser. It's a knife.
			You stole it from one of the food
			trays.
			Give it to me. We don't want you
			to hurt yourself...
			I don't believe you --
			If this is a knife... what
			happened to Mavek?
			It's very complicated. I'll
			answer all of your questions. But
			first I want you to put it down...
			No. If I'm really holding a
			phaser, then that means I was on
			the Enterprise...
			But I fired this at myself on the
			Enterprise. I should be dead
			right now...
			None of this is real --
			I'm setting this to Level Sixteen,
			wide field. That should destroy
			half of this building...
			Unless, of course, it isn't a real
			phaser.
			It's all about you, isn't it?
			You're the only constant... the
			only person in both places...
			There's a lot more going on here
			than you realize.
			None of this is real, either...
			What's happening to me?
			We can still save you -- but you
			must stop fighting us.
			You're lying...
			Let me help you...
			No!
			I'm warning you...
			No!
			He's conscious!
			We haven't finished the neuro
			chemical drain -- get him sedated!
			Riker to Enterprise!
			Enterprise here. Are you alright,
			sir?
			Emergency transport -- get me out
			of here!
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46778.1.
			Commander Riker has returned
			safely from his mission to Tilonus
			Four, where he was being held
			captive by one of the rival
			factions. Doctor Crusher has
			repaired the damage to his long
			term memory. His recovery is
			proceeding well.
			Evidently, you were abducted two
			days after beaming to the surface.
			I remember it now... I was in an
			alley... they attacked me from
			behind. I tried to defend myself
			with the nisroh knife Worf gave

			We believe they were trying to
			extract strategic information from
			your memory using a neuro-somatic
			technique.
			I was in a hospital... then on the
			Enterprise... and the hospital
			again...
			I kept shifting back and forth...
			I couldn't tell what was real...
			Your mind must have created a
			defense mechanism, a fantasy that
			helped you resist the neuro-somatic
			process. Your unconscious
			fastened onto elements from your
			real life in an attempt to keep
			you grounded... to keep you sane.
			The preparation for the mission...
			the play... they were all recent
			experiences, fresh in my mind...
			Get some rest, Number One. We can
			talk more in the morning.
			Alright... but there's one thing
			I'd like to do first...
			Are you sure you want to do this
			by yourself? The stage crew and
			I were going to wait until
			morning...
			I'm positive. After what I've
			experienced... I don't think I
			could sleep knowing this was still
