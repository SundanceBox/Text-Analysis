			Good morning, Commander.
			Data. Interesting night?
			I found it extremely interesting.
			The lateral sensor array performed
			three separate spectral analyses
			of the Alwanir Nebula on three
			distinct frequencies.
			Sorry I missed it.
			I will have the reports sent to
			you.
			We are still on course for the
			Gariman system, our speed is warp
			six and our ETA is thirteen
			hundred hours. Sickbay reported
			one minor injury in the exobiology
			department at zero four
			twenty hours.
			Very well.
			Isn't Worf supposed to relieve
			Ensign Torigan?
			Yes, sir. I was not informed of
			any change in the duty roster.
			He's never late.
			Riker to Lieutenant Worf.
			Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.
			Lieutenant Worf is in his
			quarters.
			Something's wrong. Data, you have
			the Bridge.
			Security, meet me on deck seven,
			section twenty-five baker.
			Computer, override the security
			lock on this door. Authorization:
			Riker alpha six zero.
			TORVA LUK DO SHELL!
			Worf?
			What the hell are you doing?
			He had no explanation at all?
			Not a word. He just got dressed
			and then reported for duty as if
			nothing had happened.
			Captain, this isn't the first...
			problem I've had with Worf lately.
			Oh?
			Until now, it wasn't anything
			serious so I didn't bring it to
			your attention. But, to be blunt,
			he's been getting... sloppy. His
			duty reports have been incomplete,
			he's fallen behind in maintenance
			checks, he just seems...
			distracted.
			Where's Worf now?
			I confined him to quarters.
			You have the Bridge, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			Enter.
			Captain.
			On your feet, Lieutenant.
			Sir.
			Mister Worf, your personal affairs
			are strictly your concern unless
			they interfere with the operation
			of this ship. You've crossed that
			line. Now as your Captain, I want
			to know exactly what's going on.
			It is... difficult to explain.
			Try.
			Ever since I returned from the
			Carraya system I have felt...
			empty...
			Does this have something to do
			with the Klingons you... rescued
			from Carraya Four?
			They were young... they knew
			nothing of their heritage. So
			while I was there, I tried to...
			teach them... teach them about
			their people, their culture.
			I told them our ancient stories...
			instructed them in our customs...
			explained our beliefs. And then
			I told them about Kahless... how
			he united our people long ago...
			how he gave us honor and
			strength... and how he promised to
			return one day and lead us again.
			It took time... but I saw them
			begin to discover the warriors
			within themselves... to believe in
			Kahless and his teachings... and
			to become truly Klingon. It was
			... unlike anything I had
			experienced before.
			Is that what you were doing here?
			Trying to recapture those
			feelings?
			I was trying to summon a vision of
			Kahless.
			You might have tried using the
			Holodeck instead of setting your
			quarters on fire.
			Using the Holodeck would not be
			appropriate... everything had to
			be real if Kahless were to appear.
			But all this was for nothing... he
			did not come to me.
			I gave Toq and the others a belief
			in Sto-Vo-Kor: the life which
			lies beyond this life... where
			Kahless awaits us.
			When I saw the power of their
			belief... I began to question the
			strength of my own. And I found
			it... wanting.
			Have you lost your... faith in Sto-Vo-Kor?
			To lose something, one must first
			possess it... I am not sure I ever
			had a true belief.
			But I should not have allowed it
			to interfere with my duties. My
			behavior has been --
			Inexcusable.
			But understandable. You are the
			only Klingon in Starfleet... and
			one of the few raised by human
			parents. Perhaps the problem is
			that you have only studied the
			beliefs of your people... only
			looked at them from the outside.
			It may be that what you seek
			cannot be found on the Enterprise.
			You may need to immerse yourself
			in Klingon beliefs before you can
			discover whether they hold any
			truths for you.
			Is there anything you could do...
			any place you could go... to
			explore your faith more fully?
			Boreth. The Followers of Kahless
			wait there for his return. To
			Klingons, there is no more sacred
			place.
			Boreth is twelve days from here by
			shuttle. As of this moment, you
			are on leave.
			Thank you, Captain.
			I hope you find what you're
			looking for, Mister Worf.
			Because the next time you set foot
			on this ship I expect you to carry
			out your duties like a Starfleet
			officer.
			Aye, sir.
			Torva... Luk...
			... Do Shell...
			Kahless! I see Kahless!
			He is standing before me...
			holding a sword... he wants
			something... me, he wants me! He
			wants me to go with him!
			It is a powerful vision you have
			had, Divok. Kahless has asked you
			to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You
			are only nineteen and yet your
			place among the honored dead is
			already secure
			Take him back to his chamber. Let
			him sleep.
			You are leaving us.
			It has been ten days, Koroth. But
			I have had no visions... I have
			received no insight.
			There is nothing for me here.
			What is the story of The Promise,
			Worf?
			When Kahless united the people and
			gave them the laws of honor, he
			saw that his work was done. So
			one night he gathered his
			belongings and went to the edge of
			the city to say good-bye.
			The people wept... they did not
			want him to go.
			And Kahless said, "You are
			Klingons. You need no one but
			yourselves. I will go now... to
			Sto-Vo-Kor. But I promise one day
			I will return." Then Kahless
			pointed to a star in the sky and
			said, "Look for me there... on
			that point of light."
			So here we are... on a world
			circling that distant point of
			light. It has been over fifteen
			centuries since he made that
			promise... and still we wait.
			What are ten days in the life of
			one Klingon compared to that? Is
			the son of Mogh really so easily
			discouraged?
			You came to us seeking answers...
			but this is a place of questions.
			Open your heart to Kahless... ask
			him your questions... let him
			speak to you with your mind
			unclouded by doubt or hesitation.
			Only then can you find what you
			are looking for.
			If you cannot do that... then
			perhaps you should return to your
			starship.
			I will open my heart, Kahless.
			I will...
			Torva... Luk... Do... Shell...
			I see Kahless.
			You are... real?
			I am Kahless... and I have
			returned.
			What are you doing?
			Who are you?
			It is Kahless!
			I have returned.
			You doubt me.
			Who here knows the story of how
			this sword was forged?
			No one knows. It is not written
			in the sacred texts.
			I went into the mountains... all
			the way to the Kri'stak Volcano.
			I cut off a lock of my hair and
			thrust it into the river of molten
			rock which poured from the summit.
			The hair began to burn, but then
			I plunged it into the lake of
			Lusor and twisted it into a sword.
			And after I used it to kill the
			tyrant Molor I gave it a name:
			bat'leth, the sword of honor.
			You know...
			The story of the sword is known
			only to the High Clerics... it was
			never written down, so that if he
			returned, we could be sure it was
			Kahless.
			I have returned because there is
			a great need in my people... they
			fight among themselves in petty
			wars and corrupt the glory of the
			Klingon spirit. They have lost
			their way. But it is not too
			late. I have returned and I will
			lead my people again!
			Vorcha-doh-baghk, Kahless! (All
			hail Kahless)
			Vorcha-doh-baghk, Kahless!
			What is it you are doing?
			I was getting my tricorder.
			Tri-Corder? Is it a weapon?
			No. It is a tool. I was going to
			use it to see if you were...
			To see if I were real. Proceed.
			Use your Tri-Corder.
			Well?
			You are... Klingon.
			What else could I be?
			There are many possibilities... a
			shape shifter, a holographic
			projection...
			... So, you are a skeptic, Worf.
			I like that....
			How do you know my name?
			We have met before. I appeared to
			you in a vision... in the caves of
			No'Mat... you were a child then...
			and I told you...
			... that you would do something...
			no Klingon had ever done
			before....
			Yes...
			Was I ... correct?...
			I... am the first Klingon to serve
			in Starfleet.
			"Star-Fleet"... there are still
			many things you will have to
			explain to me.
			You have a question.
			Why did you appear when I was in
			the cave? Why not appear to
			Koroth, or Torin?
			Perhaps it is because you have the
			heart of a true warrior.
			You still do not believe it is me,
			do you Worf?...
			I... want to believe.
			That is a ... beginning... .
			Captain's Log: Stardate 46852.2.
			Our mission to Endora Seven has
			been cancelled on orders from
			Starfleet Command. The Enterprise
			is to proceed directly to the
			planet Boreth, to take aboard a
			very unusual guest.
			Kahless? Hasn't he been dead for
			over a thousand years?
			One thousand five hundred and
			forty-seven years to be exact.
			Do the Klingons actually believe
			that this is the real Kahless?
			It would seem that at least Gowron
			believes it. He personally
			contacted the Federation Council
			and asked that a starship be sent
			to bring Kahless back to the Home
			World.
			Why wouldn't he send a Klingon
			ship?
			Gowron would only say that there
			were certain... security concerns
			which prompted him to make this
			request. As the nearest starship
			to Boreth, the task is ours.
			Have we heard from Worf?
			No. All communication with Boreth
			has been cut-off since yesterday.
			Set course for Boreth, Number One.
			Warp six.
			Aye, sir.
			Gowron is the Leader of the
			Council... he commands the entire
			Defense Force... if he chooses to
			oppose you...
			Do not worry. We stand on the
			threshold of a new era for our
			people... Klingons from all over
			the Empire... will flock to my
			banner...
			And yet something still weighs
			heavy on the brow of the son of
			Mogh...
			Are you contemplating yet another
			question for me?
			After three days, I am beginning
			to wonder if you know how to do
			anything else.
			Questions are the beginning of
			wisdom... it is the mark of a true
			warrior.
			But do not forget that a leader
			need not answer questions from
			those he leads... it is enough
			that he says to do a thing... and
			they will do it. If he says to
			run, they run... if he says to
			fight, they fight... if he says
			to die...
			... they die.
			Yes. If the... commander is
			worthy of their trust.
			E'Gok! (Begin!)
			What is wrong? Is there only
			anger and bloodlust in your souls?
			Is that all that is left in the
			Klingon heart?
			We do not fight merely to spill
			blood, but to enrich the spirit.
			Look at us... two warriors locked
			in battle, fighting for honor.
			How can you keep from ...
			singing... out for all to hear,
			... "We are Klingons!"...
			... Yes! Let it out!... Let the
			joy in your heart be heard!
			We are Klingons!
			We are Klingons!
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			This is the... "human" you told me
			about?
			Yes.
			You must be a mighty warrior to
			command such respect.
			Thank you.
			And you do me a great honor by
			giving me one of your women.
			They have... different ways.
			Ah. Then she is not a gift.
			No.
			It is as I said... we should be on
			a Klingon warship. This is not
			the place for us.
			Their customs may be different,
			but Worf tells me they are not
			dishonorable... and I am eager to
			see the weapons on this "Star-Ship."
			I would be happy to arrange a tour
			of the entire ship for you, once
			you've settled in. Perhaps
			Commander Riker could begin by
			showing you your quarters.
			That is acceptable.
			Then, if you'll follow me...
			Did you take any other tricorder
			readings... a neuro-physiology
			scan or an anatomical profile?
			No.
			Then it's going to be hard to
			eliminate any possibility at this
			point. He could be a coalescent
			being taking Klingon form... a bioreplicant...
			or even a Klingon
			surgically altered to resemble
			Kahless...
			I felt no deception or malice from
			him... just an over-whelming sense
			of confidence... almost arrogance.
			Worf, what are his plans when he
			returns to the Home World?
			He wants to restore the glory of
			the Empire by purging it of
			dishonor and corruption.
			I don't think Gowron's going to
			like the sound of that.
			That might have something to do
			with why he wanted a Federation
			ship to bring Kahless. Gowron may
			not want to be seen embracing
			this... Messiah before he knows
			what Kahless wants.
			Perhaps this Kahless is a...
			stalking horse for someone else...
			someone who intends to seize
			control from Gowron.
			It is not an... empirical matter.
			It is a matter of... faith.
			Faith. Then you do believe
			Kahless may have... supernatural
			attributes?
			As an android, I am unable to
			accept something which cannot be
			proven through rational means. I
			would appreciate hearing your
			insight on this matter.
			Perhaps some other time,
			Commander. I do not believe I
			could provide much... insight at
			the moment.
			Like the Duras sisters...
			Or the B'nok faction.
			There is another possibility.
			It could be the real Kahless. He
			may have actually returned... as
			he promised.
			The appearance of Kahless in the
			lava cave is consistent with the
			stories found in the Klingon
			sacred texts.
			No offense, Worf... but I have
			trouble believing that the man I
			just escorted to deck eight is...
			supernatural.
			I am not saying that he is... I
			merely think we should not
			completely reject the possibility.
			We have no reason to rule out
			anything. We haven't been ordered
			to discover the origins of our
			guest, or tell anyone what they
			should believe... we are simply
			to transport Kahless to the Home
			World... and while he's with us,
			he will be treated as an honored
			guest.
			Lieutenant. May I ask you a
			personal question?
			In the absence of empirical data,
			how will you determine whether or
			not this is the real Kahless?
			It was given to me during my Rite
			of Ascension by a man who had
			known my father.
			Did you observe the Rite here...
			among these aliens?...
			No... I returned to the Home World
			for the ceremony. But these...
			aliens have allowed me to conduct
			other Klingon rituals on the
			Enterprise. They understand that
			it is part of me.
			You mentioned a son... where is
			he?
			He is visiting my adoptive parents
			on Earth.
			Will he understand our ways
			growing up among all these...
			aliens?
			I have instructed him in our
			traditions... but Alexander will
			have to find his own path... as I
			did.
			A good knife... well forged. But
			even the best blade will rust and
			grow dull unless it is cared
			for...
			I was concerned that living with
			aliens would dull your edge.
			I am pleased to see that I was
			wrong.
			You have stood alone among these
			aliens... kept our traditions and
			our customs... held on to your
			heritage with no guidance from a
			Klingon mother or father... and
			you were willing to face me in
			single combat knowing that you had
			no chance to win.
			You are Klingon... and I would be
			proud to fight with you at my
			side.
			Commander, there is an incoming
			message. Text only.
			It is from Gowron. He is aboard
			the Klingon ship Bortas and is
			requesting that we alter course to
			rendezvous with him.
			The rendezvous coordinates are
			twenty-three light years outside
			the Klingon Border. What's he up
			to?
			Prepare to alter course.
			Captain Picard to the Bridge,
			please.
			Welcome aboard, Gowron.
			Where is he, Picard?
			I assume you're referring to
			Kahless.
			I am referring to the filthy
			pahtak who is using his name.
			Well, the... person in question is
			in his quarters at the moment.
			What have you learned about him so
			far? What kind of medical
			analysis have you done? Do you
			have any theories about his true
			origin?
			We haven't done any analyses.
			What kind of fools do you have
			working for you, Picard? The
			imposter's been aboard for nearly
			a day.
			If you wanted to run tests on
			Kahless, you should've sent a
			Klingon vessel for him.
			And have him begin spreading his
			poisonous lies through a ship of
			loyal Klingons? Never.
			If he's really an imposter you
			shouldn't have anything to worry
			about.
			Kahless has been dead for a
			thousand years... but the idea of
			Kahless is still alive. Have you
			ever fought an idea, Picard? It
			has no weapon to destroy, no body
			to kill. The idea of Kahless'
			return must be stopped here. Now.
			Or it will travel through the
			Empire like a wave... and leave
			nothing but destruction behind.
			... so Gowron has come aboard in
			order to test your claim.
			Gowron knows his days are nearly
			over... so now he comes crawling
			aboard with some kind of "test."
			We do not have to prove anything
			to Gowron.
			What is this... test?
			He has brought a knife with him...
			a knife that was supposed to be
			stained with the blood of Kahless.
			Gowron has brought the Knife of
			Kirom? No one is permitted to
			remove it from the sacred vault.
			Gowron does not care about what is
			sacred.
			Gowron wants to run a genetic
			analysis on a sample of the blood
			and on you. It should tell us if
			there is a... biological match.
			If you agree to the test... I will
			make the Enterprise facilities
			available to... ensure that it is
			conducted impartially.
			Perhaps it is time to settle the
			doubts of those who do not yet
			believe...
			I will allow the test.
			All right... that should do it.
			Computer, run a genetic comparison
			on this blood sample and the
			tissue belonging to Kahless.
			The genetic patterns are
			identical.
			But how... how can this be?
			It is true... Kahless has
			returned.
			Enter.
			Koroth, Torin.
			I had hoped to speak with
			Kahless...
			Another time, Worf. There is much
			for Kahless to do before we arrive
			at the Home World... many things
			to consider.
			Worf?
			Where are you going?
			Kahless, it might be better if --
			Go away, Koroth. I've listened to
			you and Torin until my ears burn
			with politics. Let me and Worf be
			alone for a while.
			As you wish.
			They are good men. But they
			chatter like tree hens.
			I am sorry our replicators do not
			do justice to Klingon Warnog...
			It has been so long since I have
			tasted any food or drink... there
			are many things I have forgotten.
			Kahless, may I ask you about...
			death... and Sto-Vo-Kor? Tell me
			what awaits us beyond this life.
			I do not have those answers.
			I am merely a... traveller...
			someone who has journeyed back and
			forth between this world and the
			next.
			While I am in this form, I know
			only about this world...
			And there is much work for me to
			do in this world... and you will
			be part of it, Worf.
			Me?
			It was your purity of heart that
			summoned me back from Sto-Vo-Kor...
			and Koroth has told me
			about the respect you have earned
			in the Federation and the Empire.
			I want you to have a place at my
			side as we restore honor to our
			people.
			Let me tell you about the new
			Empire we will forge...
			... it will be glorious.
			It will be war.
			You are not a fool, Worf. Do you
			really think that every Klingon in
			the Empire will bend his knee and
			grovel before this man just
			because Koroth says he is Kahless?
			He is Kahless. Your own test
			proved it.
			I will not hand over the Empire to
			Koroth because of one test.
			It is not Koroth, it is --
			Of course it is Koroth. Open your
			eyes... Koroth and the other
			"Guardians" have always opposed
			me. This is nothing more than a
			ploy for them to finally seize
			power.
			Even now, there are warriors on my
			own ship who want to see
			Kahless... there are others who
			believe he is an imposter... the
			divisions are already forming...
			It does not have to be that way...
			we could all join together and
			welcome Kahless as a united
			people.
			Don't you see? This is exactly
			why they want you to join them...
			because your brother sits on the
			Council and your voice carries
			weight in the Empire. They want
			you to influence others to follow
			them.
			Worf, we fought together once...
			side by side to keep the Empire
			from being torn apart... will you
			stand by and let these impostors
			destroy all that we fought so hard
			to protect?
			Renounce him, Worf. Stand with me
			and we can hold the Empire
			together.
			You do not understand. Kahless is
			our future... only with his help
			can we revive the pure warriors
			within ourselves.
			Listen to him, Gowron... open your
			heart and hear his words as I
			have. He will restore your
			faith... as he has restored mine.
			Give him a chance to lift your
			spirit and cleanse your heart
			before you take up arms.
			You should not have arranged this
			without my approval.
			I did. Kahless approved.
			Yes. Yes, of course he did.
			Lieutenant, would my presence here
			be inappropriate? I would greatly
			appreciate the opportunity to
			study Klingon beliefs in this
			forum, but I do not wish to give
			offense.
			Kahless welcomes all who come to
			hear his words. Your presence
			will not give offense.
			Thank you.
			Koroth. I see that not all fools
			die young.
			Kahless!
			Kahless, may I present Gowron,
			Leader of the High Council.
			You may sit.
			Long ago, a storm was heading for
			the city of Quin'lat. Everyone
			took protection within the walls
			except one man who remained
			outside. I went to him and asked
			what he was doing. "I am not
			afraid," he said. "I will not
			hide my face behind stone and
			mortar. I will stand before the
			wind and make it respect me." I
			honored his choice and went back
			inside. The next day, the storm
			came... and the man was killed...
			The wind does not respect a fool.
			Do not stand before the wind,
			Gowron.
			What was his name?
			What?
			If you were really there, you
			should be able to tell us the name
			of the man outside the walls.
			What kind of question is that?
			I did not ask you, Koroth. I
			asked him.
			Describe him to us... what was he
			wearing? How tall was he? What
			color were his eyes?
			I do not remember. It was long
			ago, and in another lifetime.
			All that matters is that I have
			returned to restore faith and hope
			to my people... to lead them back
			to the way of honor... to the
			glory that was once theirs and can
			be again. Is that what you
			oppose, Gowron?
			I oppose you. I say you are not
			Kahless... and I will not bend my
			knee to you as long as I can draw
			a breath or pick up a blade.
			No. I do not believe Kahless will
			kill him.
			A good try, Gowron... but not
			enough.
			You have no joy, Gowron. Is your
			heart so filled with distrust and
			suspicion that you have forgotten
			what it is to be truly Klingon.
			"Kahless... the greatest warrior
			of them all... "
			There is no future here... no
			glorious new era for our people.
			Gowron was right, you don't know
			the name of the man who faced the
			storm... you don't even know what
			real Warnog tastes like... and you
			certainly are not the greatest
			warrior of all.
			Whoever you are... you're not
			Kahless.
			You've said enough, now get out.
			You are using the name of Kahless
			in some twisted game... for that
			alone you should die... and if you
			do not tell me what you have done,
			I will kill you right here.
			The problems with your memory...
			are a result of... the way you
			returned.
			What do you mean?
			We -- the Guardians -- have been
			awaiting your return for
			centuries.
			But we did not have the technology
			to bring you back until now. We
			were able to use an organic sample
			of the first Kahless to... give
			you life.
			The first Kahless?
			A clone. He is a clone.
			What is a... clone?
			A being created in a laboratory...
			from genetic material taken from
			another being. You are a copy...
			a fraud.
			You are not "just" a copy. We
			gave you more than the body of
			Kahless.
			We found a way to imprint specific
			information into your neurosynaptic
			patterns... we gave you
			memories. And not just any
			memories... we gave you the
			experiences of Kahless as written
			in the sacred texts.
			So I did not do any of the things
			I remember... I was never at the
			city of Quin'lat... I never went
			to the Kri'stat Volcano...
			But what about Worf? I remember
			apparing to him in the caves of
			No'Mat when he was a boy...
			We gave you that memory as well.
			Worf told me of his vision when he
			first arrived on Boreth.
			You were not... awakened until the
			moment we transported you into the
			cave... and you appeared to Worf.
			Before that time you were
			unconscious... in a laboratory
			where we accelerated your growth,
			corrected any genetic anomalies
			that occurred, and gave you the
			wisdom and memories that --
			They grew you in a test tube...
			like some kind of fungus... then
			programmed you like a machine.
			You are twisting the truth.
			You talk to me about the truth?
			You, who have brought this... lie
			to life and then called it
			Kahless?
			It is not a lie! Genetically, he
			is Kahless. And he is needed by
			our people. You know better than
			anyone the corruption and dishonor
			that is destroying the Empire.
			They need him.
			They do not need a false god.
			How do you know that this is not
			the way the prophesy was to be
			fulfilled? Who is to say that
			what we did is wrong?
			I am. And I will not let this...
			fraud continue.
			Worf, you cannot tell Gowron about
			this.
			Do not give me orders, Koroth.
			All right. I won't tell you what
			to do. But consider this: Do you
			want Gowron's corruption to infect
			every corner of the Empire? Do
			you want our people to continue
			sacrificing their honor until they
			are no different from Romulans?
			If you tell Gowron what we have
			told you, it will destroy --
			-- him... and with him the last
			chance to restore hope to our
			people. It's your choice.
			They have been here for three
			hours seventeen minutes.
			They refused to transport back to
			the ship with the rest of Gowron's
			men. They insisted on waiting
			here until they see Kahless again.
			Their faith appears to be
			unaffected by his inability to
			defeat Gowron. They still
			believe.
			Then they are fools.
			Does that mean you no longer
			believe this is the real Kahless?
			Yes.
			I am curious. Do you still
			believe that the real Kahless will
			return someday? Or has this
			experience only deepened the
			spiritual crisis which originally
			sent you to Boreth?
			I... do not know.
			I understand your dilemma. I once
			had what could be considered a
			crisis of the spirit.
			You?
			Yes. The Starfleet officers who
			first activated me on Omicron
			Theta told me that I was an
			android -- nothing more than a
			very sophisticated machine in
			human form.
			However I realized that if I were
			simply a machine, then I could
			never be anything else -- I could
			not grow beyond my programming.
			I found that difficult to accept.
			I chose to believe that I was a
			person, that I had the potential
			to become more than a collection
			of circuits and subprocessors.
			It is a belief that I still hold.
			How did you come to your decision?
			I believe I made a... "leap of
			faith."
			I will not allow the Enterprise to
			enter Klingon space with him on
			board.
			The Klingon High Council asked you
			to bring Kahless to the Home
			World. Only they can withdraw the
			request. The Enterprise must
			continue on its mission.
			There is no mission, Koroth...
			your plan has failed.
			I will enjoy watching the life
			bleed from your veins.
			Gentlemen, please. Let us stick
			to the issue at--
			Mister Worf?
			Captain, will you excuse us for a
			moment?
			Of course.
			The man that appeared to me on
			Boreth is not the real Kahless.
			He is a clone.
			A clone!
			Yes.
			Did you really think you would get
			away with this kind of fraud? I
			will have you and this abomination
			put to death with --
			It does not matter, Gowron. You
			will still not be able to stand
			against him.
			What? He's not real. You just
			said so.
			I said he was not the real
			Kahless... but in the minds of
			our people he can be just as
			powerful as Kahless.
			Even now, two members of your own
			crew are sitting on our
			Holodeck... waiting for him to
			return.
			I do not care what they think.
			They are not alone... like many of
			our people, they need something to
			believe in... just as I did...
			something larger than
			themselves... something that will
			give their lives meaning. They
			need Kahless.
			But when they find out the
			truth... ?
			It will not matter. Despite the
			facts, they will still believe...
			They will... make a leap of
			faith... and there will be others
			just like them... not everyone...
			but enough to plunge the Empire
			into civil war if you oppose them.
			What are you saying? That I
			should just... hand over the
			Empire?
			No... that would be unwise as
			well.
			Then what are you proposing, Worf?
			You were right about one thing,
			Koroth... our people are becoming
			corrupt and decadent... they need
			moral leadership. Kahless can be
			that leader... as Emperor.
			There hasn't been an Emperor in
			three centuries!
			The political power would remain
			with the High Council. Kahless
			would be... a figurehead. But he
			would have the ability to rally
			the people... to lead by
			example... and guide them in
			spiritual matters.
			The title is meaningless without
			the power to back it up.
			Real power is in the heart. You
			would have the power to mold the
			Klingon heart... you could return
			them to honorable ways...
			according to the original
			teachings of Kahless, which are
			within you... it would be a great
			challenge, if you have the courage
			to accept it.
			And what will we tell the people
			about their new Emperor? That he
			appeared in a cave or a
			laboratory?
			We will tell them the truth... all
			of the truth. But we will also
			tell them that even if he is not
			the real Kahless... he is the
			rightful heir to Kahless.
			And if I refuse to go along with
			this?
			Then my brother and all who
			support him on the Council will
			fight you... and I will fight
			you... and the Empire will fall
			back into civil war.
			What do you say to this, Koroth?
			What I say is unimportant. What
			do you say?
			It is acceptable.
			Join with me, Gowron. Let us
			usher in this new era together.
			Vorcha-doh-baghK... Kahless.
			Farewell, Worf.
			Good-bye.
			What's wrong? You should be proud
			of what you have accomplished.
			I went to Boreth to find my
			faith... and for a time I thought
			I did... but now, my heart is
			empty again. I do not know what
			to believe...
			You doubt the real Kahless will
			return one day... you doubt that
			he is still waiting for you in Sto-Vo-Kor?
			Kahless left us -- all of us -- a
			powerful legacy... a way of
			thinking and acting that makes us
			Klingon. If his words hold wisdom
			and his philosophy is honorable...
			then does it really matter if he
			returns? What is important is
			whether we follow his teachings...
			perhaps the words are more
			important than the man.
			Q'apla, son of Mogh.
			Q'apla... Kahless.
