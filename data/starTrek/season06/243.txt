			We cannot leave this place.
			Are you afraid to die escaping?
			We are dead, Worf. We died at
			Khitomer.
			We were captured. It was worse
			than death.
			Why did you allow it to happen?
			We had no choice!
			We were defending an outpost on
			the perimeter... the Romulans took
			out our shields... their next
			blast rendered us unconscious...
			when we awoke... we were
			prisoners... unarmed and shackled.
			We were interrogated for three
			months. We tried to starve
			ourselves... but they kept us
			alive.
			The Romulan Commander -- Tokath--
			thought he was being kind.
			The Romulans hoped to trade our
			lives for territorial concessions.
			But the Klingon High Council
			refused to negotiate.
			They would not acknowledge their
			warriors had been taken prisoner.
			When it was clear that we would be
			of no use to them, Tokath offered
			to let us go.
			But we knew that our families
			believed we had fallen in battle.
			We did not wish to return and
			dishonor them.
			We asked Tokath to let us stay.
			He took pity on us.
			I understand your desire to
			preserve your families' honor.
			But what of your own? There is no
			honor in remaining prisoners.
			We lost our honor when we were
			captured. It does not matter what
			happens to us.
			All that matters is that our
			families are not dishonored.
			This is Starfleet... where did you
			get it?
			I am a Starfleet officer.
			Much has changed since Khitomer.
			It does not matter. The world
			outside these walls no longer
			exists for us. We do not speak of
			it.
			You should try to forget that
			world as well.
			Why did you come here, Worf? If
			you had found your father... you
			would have found only dishonor.
			If he had been captured as you
			were, if I had found him here...
			I would be glad to see him. There
			would be no room in my heart for
			shame.
			Much has changed since Khitomer.
			I can only hope that if my son
			came here... he would be Klingon
			enough to kill me.
			This is a Gin'tak spear.
			What of it?
			Have your parents taught you
			nothing? This is used for battle --
			not for tilling soil.
			We have no need for weapons here.
			The war is far away.
			What war?
			The war our parents came here to
			escape.
			That war... has been over for
			years.
			I'm not interested in what you
			have to say, Klingon. I have work
			to do.
			Hello again, Worf.
			They say you're going to stay here
			with us.
			Not by choice.
			Aren't you happy to escape the
			war?
			The war...
			Yes... we've heard the stories all
			our lives. How people are
			slaughtered in terrible battles...
			forced to fight, whether they want
			to or not. That's why our parents
			came here -- to make a safe
			home... a place where they could
			raise their children in peace.
			I should think you'd be relieved
			to get away from the fighting.
			You're safe here.
			A place can be safe -- and still
			be a prison. Where I come from,
			people are free to come and go as
			they choose.
			So are we.
			Tell your Father you would like to
			leave. Tell him you want to visit
			the Klingon home world. See what
			he says.
			Why would I want to go there?
			It's dangerous.
			Not any longer.
			Ba'el! Come here!
			Yes, mother.
			You are not allowed to leave the
			compound?
			Then I suppose I won't be seeing
			you at the pond again.
			I told you not to speak with him.
			I'm sorry, mother.
			Enter.
			I am Tokath.
			I can return later if I am
			disturbing you... ?
			It is a strange thing when a
			jailer concerns himself with his
			prisoner's comfort.
			Mine is a strange prison.
			You robbed the Klingons of who
			they were. You dishonored them.
			By not slitting their throats when
			we found them unconscious?
			I don't expect you to understand.
			You are a Romulan.
			You're just like L'Kor was twenty
			years ago. Proud and angry. He
			hated me; all the Klingons did.
			And I had no love for them -- I
			won't deny it.
			When I informed the High Command
			that the Klingons wanted to remain
			here... I was told that unless I
			stayed to oversee them myself,
			they would be killed.
			My decision ended my military
			career.
			Why did you do it?
			I don't expect you to understand.
			You're a Klingon.
			But I do expect you to understand
			this: we've put aside the old
			hatreds. Here, Romulans and
			Klingons live in peace. I won't
			allow you to destroy what we have.
			Do not deceive yourself. These
			people are not happy here. I see
			sadness in their eyes.
			That's not what I see when I look
			in my wife's eyes.
			I married a Klingon.
			So you see, when I warn you not to
			disrupt our lives here, I'm not
			speaking just as a jailer... but
			as a man protecting his family.
			Do not test my tolerance.

			Do you know what that song means?
			No. I just like the melody.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46580.1.
			The Yridian vessel Lieutenant Worf
			boarded at Deep Space Nine has
			failed to arrive for our scheduled
			rendezvous. It is now twelve
			hours overdue.
			Still no sign of them on long
			range scanners, sir.
			Contact DS Nine -- find out what
			they know about this Yridian
			trader.
			Hopefully he filed a flight plan
			before he left the station.
			That's the only chance we have of
			finding Worf.
			When Worf asked for leave... I had
			the feeling he was hoping none of
			it was true: that his father was
			dead, that he hadn't been
			captured.
			I think part of him was hoping
			that. But another part of him
			wanted more than anything to find
			his father.
			I'm sure that's true.
			But if Mogh... or any other
			Klingon... had been held prisoner
			for twenty years... would they
			want to be found?
			I have alerted the Romulan border
			patrols to be on the lookout for
			a Yridian ship.
			If it escapes... others will learn
			that we're here.
			I've ordered surveillance stepped
			up. If there are more intruders,
			we'll stop them.
			We haven't had to use one of these
			in a long time.
			It implants a small boridium
			pellet under the skin... we can
			use its energy signature to track
			you.
			In time, you will grow accustomed
			to life here.
			Never.
			He is one of yours. Deal with him
			however you like.
			But I warn you... if he becomes a
			disruption, I will not be so
			tolerant.
			Toq... you will guard him.
			He is free to move around inside
			the compound. But make certain he
			does not cause trouble.
			What are you doing?
			The Mok'bara...
			The forms clear the mind... and
			center the body.
			No. Like this...
			This is the Mok'bara... a great
			warrior called Kahless invented
			the forms when he went to the
			underworld in search of his
			father. Kahless showed him the
			forms, and his father was able to
			remember his body and return to
			the world of the living.
			First you must learn to breathe...
			stand up... as tall as you can...
			Take a wider stance.
			You must stop --
			The forms are the basis for
			Klingon combat. You would be wise
			to learn them.
			I will teach you. Join us.
			We'll see what L'Kor thinks of
			this.
			Again... take your stance...
			Mother?
			She's not here. Come in...
			This is what I wanted to show you.
			I don't know why, but I'm not
			supposed to look at these things.
			They're Klingon, aren't they?
			Yes...
			I thought you might be able to
			tell me about them.
			This is a warrior's armor.
			And this is the D'k tahg...
			It should not be allowed to rust
			like this...
			Isn't it beautiful?
			That is a Jinaq... it is given to
			a daughter when she comes of age,
			old enough to take a mate.
			Ba'el!
			Mother --
			Take that off at once.
			Go.
			Why is she forbidden to know what
			these things are?
			They do not matter here. Go.
			... Kahless held his father's
			lifeless body in his arms. He
			could not believe what his brother
			had done. Then his brother threw
			their father's sword into the sea,
			saying that if he could not
			possess it, neither would Kahless.
			That was the last time the
			brothers would speak.
			What happened to the sword?
			Kahless looked into the ocean and
			wept, for the sword was all he had
			left of his father... and the sea
			filled with his tears and flooded
			beyond the shore.
			The people begged Kahless to stop
			his weeping, and he did... and
			walked into the water to find the
			lost sword.
			He searched and searched the murky
			ocean bottom, holding his breath
			for three days and three nights...
			That is impossible!
			For you, perhaps. Not for
			Kahless. He was a great warrior.
			You're making it up.
			These are our stories. They tell
			us who we are.
			It is late. It is time to sleep.
			Worf...
			You never answered my question.
			Did Kahless find his father's
			sword?
			Yes. He found it.
			The stories you tell... are they
			true?
			I have studied them all my life...
			and find new truths in them every
			time.
			Kahless... did he ever take a
			mate?
			That is... another story.
			Tell me...
			You are... Romulan.
			Tokath is my father. I thought
			you knew that.
			How could your mother... mate with
			a... Romulan?
			Why shouldn't she?
			It is... an obscenity.
			What are you saying? They love
			each other...
			Romulans are treacherous...
			deceitful... they are without
			honor.
			My father is a good man. He is
			kind, and generous... there is
			nothing dishonorable about him.
			He was part of a cowardly attack
			on Khitomer... thousands of
			Klingons were massacred -- many of
			them women and children.
			I don't know what you're talking
			about. My father came here to
			escape the wars. He would never
			kill anyone.
			Ask him. Ask your mother. Tell
			them you want to know the truth.
			What is it, Number One?
			We just received the Yridian's
			flight plan from Deep Space Nine.
			He gets around... he's been to
			three different systems in the
			past week -- he could have left
			Worf at any of them.
			Are any of these systems near
			Romulan space?
			Two of them. The Nequencia and
			the Carraya systems.
			Let's head for the closer one.
			Aye, sir.
			What do you want?
			I... I am sorry if I upset you.
			I was surprised... I became angry.
			But I do not blame you. You
			cannot help being what you are.
			There's nothing wrong with what I
			am.
			What I mean is... it is not your
			fault.
			What? Being born? I'm sorry if
			that offends you.
			No, I...
			It is hard to explain. Klingons
			and Romulans are blood enemies --
			we have been for centuries...
			Not here. Here we live in peace.
			But I do not live here.
			Worf... before you knew... you
			were attracted to me.
			Can't you leave the hatred behind,
			too? Can't you accept me... as I
			am?
			I don't know.
			What have you done to her?
			You are responsible. She is what
			she is because of you.
			Lying down with a Romulan.
			Who are you to judge me?
			My husband died at Khitomer. We
			had left a son on the Home
			World... five years old. The
			first year I was here I thought I
			would die from the pain of knowing
			I'd never see him again.
			Not a day goes by that I don't
			think of him, wonder about him.
			But I will never know who he is.
			I gave him up -- because I loved
			him too much to dishonor him.
			I understand your sacrifice. And
			I respect it. But to mate with a
			Romulan -- this I do not
			understand.
			By the second year, I had stopped
			weeping for my son. There were
			days when I could even laugh...
			and I began to look around me and
			realize that this would be my
			world forever.
			I looked at Tokath... our captor.
			I saw that he was a kind man...
			and a lonely one.
			And I knew that he was looking at
			me, as well.
			In the third year I decided to
			give up hatred... and loneliness.
			I am not ashamed of that decision,
			and I won't be judged for it.
			Leave this house. You've done
			enough harm.
			Ka'la!
			That's not how you play this game.
			The Qa'vak is not a game -- it
			hones the skills of the hunt.
			The hunt?
			We have replicators here.
			Klingons do not hunt because they
			need food. The hunt is a ritual
			that reminds us of where we come
			from.
			I know where I come from. Right
			here.
			It is a difficult skill to master.
			Perhaps you are too young.
			Throw it.
			Your arm is strong. But it needs
			practice. Hold your other arm
			like this...
			... and aim along it.
			Throw.
			Ka'la!
			You learn quickly. Perhaps it is
			time to put your skills to the
			test.
			What do you mean?
			Come. I will teach you how to
			hunt.
			You're not allowed to leave the
			compound.
			They won't allow it.
			I think they will.
			Hunting? Have you lost your mind?
			The boy could come with me.
			I cannot sit in the compound like
			an old man. I must practice my
			skills.
			We can't let you out. You've
			already tried to escape once.
			I give you my word as a warrior.
			I will not try to escape.
			Leave us. We have work to do.
			Tokath... He gave his word.
			Are you seriously suggesting we
			open the gates and let him wander
			free... with only a boy as his
			guard?
			Twenty-three years ago I gave you
			my word. In all this time, have
			I ever broken it?
			I told you he was yours to deal
			with. If you want to take this
			risk, the responsibility is yours.
			You will go with him. Take a
			weapon. If he breaks his word and
			tries to escape... kill him.
			Stop!
			Kahless was condemned to die by
			the tyrant Molor, who was angered
			that Kahless had incited the
			people against him. The night
			before his execution, Kahless
			asked that he be allowed to go out
			into the night and say farewell to
			the moon and the stars... for he
			knew that in the netherworld, he
			would not see them again.
			Kahless gave his word that he
			would come back, and Molor let him
			go.
			That was foolish.
			The next day at dawn, Kahless
			returned... and was put to death.
			He could have saved himself.
			He had given his word. Molor
			understood what that meant. Just
			as L'Kor did.
			Come.
			He is there. But the wind has
			shifted. We must wait.
			Why? We're so close.
			Never approach your prey from
			upwind; the breeze will carry your
			scent.
			The wind is shifting again.
			I don't smell anything.
			He is there.
			How can you --
			Yes... I can smell it.
			Remember the scent. More than
			anything else, it will guide you.
			It's strong. I can't believe I
			couldn't smell it before.
			Let it work its way into your
			blood.
			I can feel my heart pounding.
			Yes. This is the moment where
			life and death meet.
			This is who we are. Warriors.
			I was never taught that...
			There is much you were never
			taught.
			Aren't you hungry, L'Kor?
			Or are you upset because your
			prisoner hasn't returned?
			I should not have sent the boy
			with him. If he's been hurt --
			Don't worry, my friend. They'll
			be back... after all, a warrior
			keeps his word. Isn't that so?
			Father... if I wanted to visit
			Romulus, or the Klingon Home world --
			would I be allowed to go?
			Ka'la!
			Tonight we eat well.
			Get that off my table.
			You do not kill an animal unless
			you intend to eat it.
			Get rid of it.
			I intend to, Tokath.
			But not until it's cooked.
			Today I learned the ritual hunt.
			But that is not all I learned. I
			discovered that warrior's blood
			runs in my veins.
			I do not know how or why, but we
			have forgotten ourselves. Our
			stories are not told, our songs
			are not sung.
			Tonight as we came home, we sang
			a song of victory -- a song known
			to me only as a lullaby. But it
			is a warrior's song.
			Bagh Da tuHmoh... fire streaks the
			heavens. ChojaH Duh rHo... battle
			has begun.
			Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo.

			Well, Worf... you've had quite an
			effect on the young people.
			I have done nothing more than show
			them what they are.
			No. You have shown them what you
			want them to be.
			Tell me this: do you know of any
			place, any time in history that
			Klingons and Romulans have lived
			together in peace?
			We have despised each other...
			fought each other... for
			centuries.
			Except here. On this remote
			planet... Romulans and Klingons
			live together in harmony.
			No government, no leader, has ever
			done what I have done here.
			It is a worthy achievement to
			bring peace between enemies.
			But the cost of that peace may be
			too high.
			Higher than endless war?
			The people here have lost the
			sense of who they are. They have
			lost their heritage.
			In what way? A few stories not
			told... a few songs not sung...
			not a great loss, when compared to
			our living in peace.
			Those are our rituals... they
			define us. They tell us what we
			came from... what our children
			will grow to be. Without
			traditions, we have no identity --
			we have no pride.
			Klingon pride. Is it really so
			valuable? Or is it just a tired
			habit...
			Today Toq went with me on the
			ritual hunt... I saw what happened
			to him when he caught the scent of
			his prey on the wind... for the
			first time in his life, he felt
			powerful... that's what he has
			been denied by living here...
			that's what you have tried to take
			away from him.
			For you, perhaps that is enough.
			The young people may want more.
			More? What more is there than
			what they have here? Would you
			really suggest they go into a
			universe where some would hate
			them -- simply because of who they
			are? Those traditions and rituals
			you cherish so much would not
			allow them to remain friends with
			Romulans.
			Enough of this. We could talk all
			night and not convince the other.
			I offer you a choice. Live with
			us... as one of us...
			Or?
			Or I will have you put to death.
			Then that is what you will have to
			do.
			Worf, consider this carefully --
			That death will be honorable. The
			young people will see what it is
			to die as a Klingon.
			Enter.
			Thank you.
			I will remove the tracking device.
			You can go over the wall and hide
			in the jungle.
			Why are you doing this?
			My father is wrong.
			No matter how I might feel about
			you, you don't deserve to die.
			I am not going to run away, Ba'el.
			They will kill you.
			Yes. But they will not defeat me.
			I don't understand you.
			A Klingon does not run from his
			battles.
			Is that really the lesson you want
			us to learn?
			You've taught us a great deal...
			awakened something in us that we
			didn't know existed...
			But I don't understand what we can
			learn from your death.
			Then you don't yet understand what
			it is to be Klingon.
			Worf... in spite of everything
			that's happened, I sense that you
			still care for me. Am I wrong?
			It's so easy for you to talk of
			being a warrior... of honor and
			death... is it so hard to speak of
			love?
			Worf... please...
			I... would not have thought it
			possible to love a Romulan...
			But you do... ?
			Yes.
			If you have come that far... can't
			you take the next step? Can't you
			stay here with us... with me?
			If there were a way... I would
			take you with me...
			If there's anything I've learned
			from you... from your reaction to
			me... it's that I have no place
			out there. Other Klingons won't
			accept me for what I am.
			And if I stay here... these
			Klingons will not accept me for
			what I am.
			Why did you come here? We were
			happy... we didn't know there was
			anything missing from our lives...
			Ba'el...
			Good-bye, Worf.
			I know there are those among you
			who may question what I'm about to
			do. And you would not be wrong to
			do so.
			I have questioned myself... I have
			spent the night considering my
			decision, challenging myself to
			justify whether it is right.
			And I have reached the conclusion
			that it is absolutely necessary to
			put this man to death.
			We have all shared an
			extraordinary passage... from
			being enemies... to becoming a
			family.
			Turla, you were midwife when my
			daughter was born... she might
			have died if it had not been for
			you.
			Sentith... you wrestled with a
			wild morag... to save a Klingon
			child.
			I stood at your side when you
			married, Ba'ktor.
			And wept with you when she fell
			ill and died.
			Every one of you could tell
			similar stories... of things we
			have shared... in love and in
			sorrow.
			What we have built together...
			would be destroyed by this man.
			And I cannot let that happen.
			I give you one last chance to
			accept our way of life.
			Your words are eloquent, Tokath.
			But the truth is that I am being
			executed because I brought
			something dangerous to your young
			people: knowledge.
			Knowledge of their origins.
			Knowledge of the real reasons you
			are here in this camp. The truth
			is a threat to you...
			Enough.
			Stand ready.
			Father... please...
			Raise your weapons.
			Ki'tow! (Stop!)
			If you kill him... you will have
			to kill me, too.
			Step aside, Toq.
			Worf would rather die than accept
			this way of life.
			And so would I.
			I want to leave... as do many
			others. You will have to kill us
			to keep us here.
			You see, Tokath? It's already too
			late.
			I am warning you -- move aside
			now.
			Stand ready.
			Toq. Move away...
			He will listen to you. Tell
			him...
			He has the right to make his
			choice.
			Raise your weapons.
			Take aim --
			Ba'el...
			Tokath... long ago, when your
			captives asked to stay here... we
			hoped not to dishonor our children
			on the Home World. But perhaps,
			over the years, we lost sight of
			the children we raised here.
			This is our prison. It should not
			be theirs.
			Years ago, your parents made a
			great sacrifice for the sake of
			their families. Today they do so
			again. For that, we must honor
			them.
			You must promise them -- that you
			will never reveal their secret.
			No one must know of this place.
			There's a supply ship due in a few
			days. They will take us...
			When they arrive, Tokath will
			explain to them. We'll be able to
			start a new life...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46581.5.
			We have scanned the planets of the
			Nequencia system and found no
			evidence of a Romulan prison camp.
			We are now enroute to the Carraya
			system, closer to Romulan space.
			Captain, we are receiving a
			subspace message. It is a Romulan
			signal, text only.
			It is from Lieutenant Worf. He is
			aboard a Romulan scout ship.
			He is requesting a rendezvous.
			Input the coordinates and change
			course.
			They seem fine. We'll be giving
			them all thorough checkups in
			Sickbay.
			Thank you, Doctor.
			Welcome home, Lieutenant.
			Thank you, sir.
			Picard to Bridge. Signal the
			Romulan ship that we have the last
			group on board.
			Aye, sir.
			I see you found what you were
			looking for, Mister Worf.
			No, sir. There was no prison
			camp.
			Those young people are
			survivors... of a vessel that
			crashed in the Carraya system four
			years ago.
			No one survived Khitomer.
			I understand, Mister Worf.
