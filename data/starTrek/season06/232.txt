			Captain's Log, Stardate 46192.3.
			We have arrived at Starbase
			one-one-two and are loading relief
			supplies destined for Tagra Four,
			an ecologically devastated planet
			in the Argolis Cluster. We have
			also taken on a rather unusual
			passenger.
			Welcome to the Enterprise. We're
			delighted to have you aboard.
			Thank you, Sir.
			Congratulations. I understand
			you were selected from among
			hundreds of applicants for this
			internship.
			Yes, sir. I still can't believe
			they chose me... there were lots
			of people with better records...
			Your transcript is very
			impressive...
			She's done honors work in
			neurobiology, plasma dynamics,
			and eco-regeneration. I'd call
			that pretty well-rounded.
			That's a nice way of saying I
			haven't made up my mind about
			what I want to do with my life.
			I've arranged to have you work
			in all the major departments while
			you're here. I'm willing to bet
			that by the time it's over you'll
			have a pretty good idea what field
			you're interested in.
			Or at least what fields you're not
			interested in.
			Come.
			We're bringing up the last of the
			cargo, sir. We should be ready
			to leave within the hour.
			Commander, would you escort Ms.
			Rogers to her quarters? I have
			to discuss the Tagran's medical
			needs with Doctor Crusher.
			You've won yourself a rare
			opportunity. Avail yourself of
			it.
			I will, sir.
			It'll take a few days before you
			know your way around. If you
			ever need help just use one of
			the companels...
			We're on deck seven, section...
			Four?
			That's right.
			I practically memorized the specs
			on the way here.
			You're a quick study.
			This is it.
			Is this for me?
			All yours.
			It's so... big.
			For honor students, only the best.
			I could've brought The Zoo.
			The zoo?
			That's what my parents call it.
			Three dogs isn't so many, is it?
			Depends how they get along.
			I'd have a dozen, but my mother
			said enough is enough.
			I'm sure going to miss them.
			We'll try and keep you so busy
			you won't have time to.
			I'd better be going; I have to get
			back to the Cargo Bay.
			Thanks for walking me down.
			Oh, no... I didn't mean it...
			You can't be here... Go away.
			All of you.
			You too.
			See these readouts? This is your
			heart rate, your blood pressure...
			all your vital signs.
			You're in good shape.
			You might just live to be my age.
			All these tricorders have to be
			tested before they get put in the
			supply containers we're taking
			to Tagra.
			So I scan myself with each one
			to make sure all the readouts are
			working?
			If they're not, put that unit
			aside and we'll run a diagnostic
			on it.
			So I understand you were accepted
			to the Academy... I have a son
			there.
			Being posted on the Enterprise,
			I guess you don't get to see him
			very often... ?
			Not as often as I'd like.
			Do you have any other children?
			My husband died a number of years
			ago. Wes was our only child.
			Was he old enough to know his
			father?
			Jack died when he was five.
			My parents died when I was a baby.
			I don't remember anything about
			them... Sometimes I wonder what
			they were like.
			I understand your adopted parents
			are in Starfleet.
			They're marine biologists... They
			were just posted to the Bilaren
			system.
			Sickbay to Doctor Crusher... you
			wanted to be told when the
			cultures were ready.
			On my way.
			I have to go. When you've
			finished with the tricorders,
			Nurse Ogawa can help you take them
			down to the Shuttlebay for
			loading.
			Okay.
			Thanks for your help. We need
			every spare hand we can get; this
			is one of the biggest relief
			efforts we've ever mounted.
			Why are you taking everything down
			in shuttlecraft?
			We can't use the transporters
			because of all the ionization in
			the Tagran atmosphere.
			From the barystatic filters?
			How'd you know that?
			I did a paper on eco-regeneration.
			Then you know that a thousand
			barystatic filters put out a lot
			of ionization...
			A thousand... ?
			They've managed to pollute their
			atmosphere pretty badly.
			It's amazing... that they go to
			such lengths to clean the air...
			instead of regulating the
			emissions that cause the problem.
			You're right.
			All the filters can do is keep
			things from getting worse. They
			shoot negative ions into the
			planet's stratosphere --
			-- where they come into contact
			with airborne pollutants and
			transfer their charge. The
			filters have positively charged
			intake vents that the pollutants
			become attracted to; that sets
			up a kind of ionic current in the
			atmosphere.
			Commander, are you all right?
			Yeah... I didn't even see it
			coming...
			Come in.
			Commander Riker told me you liked
			dogs...
			What's your name?
			This is Henry.
			Henry?
			Don't ask me.
			Where'd he come from?
			Ensign Janklow is going to the
			Gantol excavations for three
			weeks. He's been trying to find
			someone to take care of Henry.
			I'll do it.
			Okay. But be warned -- he has
			an appetite for boots.
			By the time Ensign Janklow gets
			back I'll have Henry shaking
			hands.
			Doctor Crusher tells me you're
			considering a career in zoology.
			I was... but this morning I
			decided to become a Starfleet
			doctor... then by this afternoon
			I realized I was really meant to
			be a Chief Engineer.
			What does a ship's counselor do?
			Maybe that's what I'll want to
			be by tomorrow.
			There are just so many things I'm
			interested in... sometimes I worry
			that I'll never focus on just
			one thing...
			There's nothing wrong with keeping
			your options open.
			I'm just afraid I won't have
			enough time for everything I want
			to do. I mean --
			-- there's school, and then
			graduate study, and a career...
			and of course I want to get
			married and have children -- lots
			of children -- and more animals...
			Maybe I should study
			agriculture... have a big farm
			somewhere...
			Amanda... whatever you choose,
			I'm sure you'll be good at it.
			I know one thing... I wouldn't
			mind coming back to the Enterprise
			when I graduate.
			Who knows? Maybe you will.
			-- this is the main control area.
			We can access just about any
			primary circuit from these panels.
			That's a Jeffries tube over there
			--
			Where most of the major systems
			conduits are routed.
			You've done your homework.
			It's hard to imagine how much
			energy is being harnessed in
			there...
			Imagination is not necessary; the
			scale is readily quantifiable.
			We are presently generating twelve
			point seven-five billion gigawatts
			per second.
			The temperature in the reaction
			chamber has increased by
			forty-seven percent.
			The injector couplings are frozen
			-- I can't slow the reaction...
			Temperature increase is at one
			hundred six percent... and rising.
			La Forge To Bridge!
			Picard, here.
			We're heading for a core breach!
			We're going to have to try and
			vent the plasma!
			Plasma inductors are not
			responding.
			We're going to lose containment...
			Bring down the isolation door -
			we have to eject the warp core.
			Everybody out! Move it!
			Temperature in the reaction
			chamber is back to normal.
			She's a little shaken up, but
			she'll be all right.
			You said she was adopted... could
			she be an alien?
			She's human... and there's nothing
			unusual about her, not that my
			instruments can detect.
			Commander, have you been able to
			determine the cause of the warp
			breach?
			No, sir. Everything was normal
			and then... it's like the laws
			of physics suddenly went out the
			window.
			And why not? They're terribly
			inconvenient.
			Q...
			Mon Capitan.
			Are you responsible for the
			incident in Engineering?
			Of course. I needed to find out
			if what I suspected about the girl
			was true.
			That being?
			That she's Q.
			Amanda... is a Q... ?
			How is that possible? Her
			parents... her biological
			parents... were human.
			Not exactly.
			They had assumed human form...
			in order to visit Earth. For an
			amusement, I suppose... but in
			vulgar human fashion they
			proceeded to conceive a child.
			Then, like mawkish humans, they
			became attached to it. What is
			it about those squirming little
			infants that you find so
			appealing?
			I'm sure that's beyond your
			comprehension, Q.
			I desperately hope so.
			What happened to Amanda's parents?
			They died in an accident. None
			of us knew whether the child would
			inherit the capacities of a Q...
			but recently, they began to
			emerge. As an expert on humanity
			-- I was sent to investigate.
			You, an expert on humanity... ?
			Not a very challenging field of
			study, I'll grant you...
			Are you saying you caused the core
			breach -- just to test her?
			What if she hadn't been able to
			stop it?
			Then I would've known she wasn't
			Q.
			Now that you know, what do you
			intend to do?
			Instruct her, of course. If that
			child doesn't learn how to control
			her power... she could accidently
			destroy herself. Or all of you.
			Perhaps your entire galaxy.
			Somehow I find it hard to believe
			that you'd come here to do us a
			favor...
			You're quite right -- I wouldn't.
			But there are those in the
			Continuum who have an exaggerated
			sense of responsibility... and
			think we should take precautions
			to keep the little dear from
			running amuck.
			And once you've taught her...
			you'll go away?
			And leave her here... when she's
			Q? Of course not... she'll come
			to the Continuum, where she
			belongs.
			Wait a minute... you can't just
			come in here and take her away
			from everything she's known...
			I assure you, I can --
			She has plans for herself... she
			wants a career, a family --
			I can rescue her from that
			miserable existence.
			That "miserable existence" is all
			she's known for eighteen years.
			You have no right to take it away
			from her.
			Mon Capitan... I really think we
			need to speak privately.
			There. Isn't that better? Doctor
			Crusher gets more shrill with each
			passing year...
			What is it you really want, Q?
			Why bring Amanda here... to the
			Enterprise?
			Where better than here, among my
			dear friends? After all... you
			know so much about the Q...
			you're the perfect people to
			introduce me to the child. Let
			her know she can trust me.
			Trust you -- !
			Jean-Luc... you wound me...
			I don't trust you and I certainly
			wouldn't expect Amanda to.
			She'd better -- because I'm all
			she's got. She needs me to
			prepare her... for her future with
			the Q.
			She may not want that future.
			The decision is hers.
			Yes, yes -- fine.
			But do you really think she'll
			want to remain a feeble mortal?
			If Amanda is a Q... she'll need
			to understand what that means.
			I'll introduce you, but we cannot
			continue to fight like this in
			front of Amanda. For her sake,
			we'll have to appear to be...
			Pals?
			Civil.
			We need time to explain this
			to her.
			I knew I could count on you,
			Jean-Luc.
			Mister Data... I want you to
			access any available records on
			Amanda Rogers.
			Yes, Captain.
			I want to know more about her
			biological parents... about their
			death. I find it odd that any
			Q could die in an accident.
			It does not seem consistent with
			what we know of them.
			I'm convinced Q isn't telling
			us everything. See what you can
			find out.
			Aye, sir.
			It started happening about six
			months ago... things I wished for
			suddenly appearing... objects
			moving on their own... I thought
			I was going crazy...
			In a funny way, finding this out
			is kind of a relief.
			I can understand that.
			The person I mentioned... from
			the Q Continuum... would like to
			meet you. If you want to...
			I'm ready.
			There's my girl!
			Amanda, this is Q.
			He is...
			... an acquaintance of ours. We've
			known him for years.
			Very impressive the way you
			contained that explosion. What
			else have you done?
			I... don't understand.
			Telekinesis, teleportation,
			spontaneous combustion of someone
			you didn't like -- that sort of
			thing.
			I think what Q means to ask is...
			have you deliberately used your
			abilities... ?
			Not until I came here. The first
			time was when the container almost
			fell on Commander Riker.
			You did so well with that I
			decided to give you a real
			challenge... the warp core
			breach.
			She clearly has potential. I see
			no reason why she can't come back
			to the Continuum right now.
			What?
			Q --
			I don't want to go anywhere...
			Don't worry. With time you'll
			be able to overcome the
			disadvantages you suffered as a
			child. No one will hold it
			against you that you were human.
			Captain Picard -- ?
			Let's go, Amanda.
			She doesn't want to --
			Leave me alone! I'm not going
			anywhere with you!
			You agreed she has the right to
			decide her own future... yet the
			first chance you get you try to
			abduct her.
			You overreact as usual, Jean-Luc.
			I assure you -- I was merely
			testing her power. She's quite
			a little spitfire, isn't she?
			What's going on, Q? What's your
			real purpose in being here?
			I've made that quite clear. The
			Continuum has a vested interest
			in this young woman...
			If you intend to protect that
			investment, I suggest you approach
			her differently.
			She's just a little skittish.
			She'll have to start behaving like
			a Q.
			If I'm not mistaken, she just did.
			I don't want anything to do with
			that Q person. I don't care about
			having powers...
			You understand, don't you? I have
			things I want to do... I'm going
			to the Academy... I want a career,
			I want to join Starfleet...
			You can still do those things...
			But now it's so -- complicated.
			This power I have... it's just
			going to get in the way. I don't
			want to have to deal with it...
			But you have to.
			I know how you feel. It would
			be so much easier if none of this
			had happened... if it would just
			go away.
			But it's not going to go away.
			You need someone to help you.
			And the person who can help you
			-- is Q.
			But he's horrible.
			But he's the only one who can help
			you understand who you are. There
			are hard choices you're going to
			have to make about your future...
			and you can't make them by
			ignoring the truth.
			You're right.
			But I don't want any of this to
			disrupt my time here. I want to
			do everything I'm expected to
			do... and I don't want you to
			treat me any differently.
			Please?
			You've got a deal. The first free
			hour you have, report to me in
			the medical lab. I have an
			experiment I need help with.
			Yes, ma'am.
			Your progress, Q?
			As anticipated there have been
			some problems... but the humans
			are cooperating. I need more
			time.
			There is a possibility we won't
			have to terminate her.
			Come in.
			Hello, my dear...
			I've been told that I behaved
			badly. I...
			... a-pol-ogize...
			Apparently you had every right
			to chastise me...
			... but what's done is done.
			Right?
			I'd like to ask you some
			questions.
			Anything...
			What, exactly, are the Q?
			It would be so much easier to show
			you than to tell you. If you'd
			just agree to take a short visit
			to the Continuum --
			No. Just tell me.
			To put it simply... we are
			omnipotent. There is nothing --
			nothing -- we can't do.
			And what do you do with this
			power?
			Whatever we want.
			Do you use it to help others?
			I think you've missed the point.
			You've obviously spent far too
			much time among humans.
			As a Q, you can have your heart's
			desire instantly... whatever it
			might be. Would you like precious
			jewels? Works of art? Would you
			like to visit the rings of
			Tautine?
			I don't care about any of those
			things.
			Of course not. You're a Q. But
			surely there is something you
			want... something you never
			dreamed would be possible...
			What is it, Amanda? Just tell
			me...
			I've always wanted to see what
			my parents looked like... my real
			parents.
			How quaint.
			So do it.
			What do you mean?
			Summon the image.
			But... I don't know how.
			Think about them... evoke the
			memory...
			But --
			Amanda. You can do this. Trust
			me.
			Close your eyes... concentrate...
			In your mind, return to the time
			when you were an infant... think
			about your parents... try and
			remember them... now, open your
			eyes.
			They look so happy...
			They loved me...
			Ten percent benasopil.
			So I add thirty milliliters to
			each of the cultures...
			Twenty milliliters...
			Right, twenty... I wait for it
			to be metabolized... add --
			another twenty?
			... wait for it to be
			metabolized... over and over until
			the bacilli can't absorb any more.
			That's it.
			Just be sure and record the rate
			of mitosis in each dish.
			Mitosis... right.
			You seem a little distracted.
			Well... I just saw my parents.
			My real parents.
			Q showed me how...
			Can you imagine how that felt... ?
			No... I don't think I can.
			You were right... I can't ignore
			what's happened to me...
			...but... I don't know if I can
			cope with it.
			You're stronger than you think,
			Amanda...
			When I looked at my parents...
			right there, in front of me...
			I realized -- I caused this to
			happen.
			I wanted to see them... and I did.
			If it were you... if suddenly you
			could have anything you wanted...
			what do you think you'd do?
			I have no idea --
			No, think about it. Really think.
			Suddenly you have the power to
			do anything. What would it be?
			I... I'm not sure. I'd probably
			want to cure people... people who
			were hopelessly ill.
			Would you bring your husband back?
			Oh, Amanda, I don't know... I
			don't think I could decide about
			something like that until I was
			faced with it...
			I am faced with it.
			Go on with your work. I'll be
			back to check on you later.
			I thought she'd never leave.
			I don't think I'll ever get used
			to that...
			It's time for another lesson.
			I have to do this experiment
			first.
			What is it you're doing?
			We're delivering live vaccine
			bacilli to Tagra. I'm supposed
			to find the best nutrient solution
			for keeping them alive while
			they're in stasis.
			How fascinating...
			I have a splendid idea. We'll
			combine your work... with our
			lesson. I'll show you how to
			finish this in no time.
			I think I'd better do it the way
			Doctor Crusher showed me.
			Why? I'm sure the Doctor would
			be delighted if you could speed
			things along. Think what it would
			mean... you could handle double...
			triple the work load.
			Well... I guess so.
			All right. As you look at the
			tissue samples... form an image
			of them in your mind...
			Number One... Doctor Crusher has
			some live vaccine bacilli for
			delivery to Tagra... they'll need
			to be shipped in a stasis field.
			Will you make the arrangements?
			I'll get right on it.
			Captain, there is a message from
			Tagra Four.
			On screen.
			Enterprise, I am Orn Lote,
			Engineer. We are having
			difficulties with the reactor that
			powers our barystatic filters on
			the southern continent. We may
			have to shut it down for repairs.
			Perhaps my Chief Engineer could
			assist you... ?
			I hope so. If we are forced to
			disable the reactor, it would take
			months to re-establish the ionic
			currents the filters have formed
			in the atmosphere.
			Send us your design specifications
			-- I'm sure we can do something.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Captain... may I see you for a
			moment?
			What is it, Mister Data?
			I have some information regarding
			Amanda Rogers' parents.
			Records indicate that they died
			in Topeka, Kansas.
			Their home was destroyed during
			a tornado.
			A tornado? Why wasn't it
			dissipated by the Weather
			Modification Net?
			Unknown, sir. The bodies were
			found in the rubble after the
			storm had passed.
			See if you can find out any
			details. I'd like to know more
			about that storm.
			Yes, Captain.
			If it isn't Number Two...
			I'm looking for Doctor Crusher.
			I don't know what nutrients she
			wants to ship with the bacilli.
			I'm not sure... I'll tell her to
			contact you.
			Thanks.
			You could wait for her here... ?
			If you wanted to...
			Just tell her I'll be in
			Shuttlebay Two.
			You're attracted -- to him?
			Of course not...
			I think you are. How repulsive...
			how can you stand that hair all
			over his face?
			Doctor... Commander Riker was
			looking for you... he said he'd
			be in Shuttlebay Two.
			Thank you.
			You've finished already?
			How did you do it so quickly?
			Q helped me... we did it in less
			than half the time it would've
			normally taken.
			That explains this data.
			I needed to know the rates of
			mitosis. By artificially
			accelerating them you made the
			experiment useless. Now I'll have
			to do it over again.
			I'm sorry, Doctor...
			Don't be sorry. If she wants to
			do things the hard way, that's
			her business.
			Why did you interfere with what
			she was doing?
			She's Q... making her plod through
			human chores is an insult to her.
			She has asked not to be treated
			differently.
			That doesn't mean you have to bore
			her to death.
			I don't interfere with what you're
			trying to teach Amanda --
			You wouldn't be capable of
			interfering --
			I don't think it's too much to
			ask for you to do the same --
			-- and you stay out of mine.
			Now that you put it like that,
			I think you're absolutely right.
			Captain...
			Yes, Mister Data?
			I have more information regarding
			the tornado that killed Amanda
			Rogers' parents.
			What is it?
			It was unusually compact, yet
			extremely powerful -- its recorded
			wind velocity was characteristic
			of a funnel three times its size.
			Download the files to my Ready
			Room. I'll study them in
			there.
			Yes, sir.
			Doctor Crusher was only trying
			to help me... you shouldn't have
			turned her into a dog...
			Now, be truthful, Amanda. Wasn't
			it amusing?
			Just a little?
			Well...
			There, you see? My dear, what's
			the point of having these
			abilities if you can't enjoy them?
			Now -- have you been practicing
			your teleportation?
			Yes. But it's kind of hard. I
			keep ending up somewhere I don't
			want to be.
			You're going to have to start
			honing your abilities. It won't
			do to be sloppy... let's see...
			perhaps a little game?
			I'm going to hide somewhere on
			the ship... you try to find me.
			But how do I know --
			Don't worry, Amanda. You can do
			it...
			Not bad. Not bad at all.
			The trick is to come up with a
			field modulater that doesn't
			require shutting down their
			reactor...
			If we use (TECH), we can devise
			a mechanism that integrates into
			the existing system while it is
			in operation.
			You're still thinking like a
			human...
			Now do you understand? What do
			humans have to offer that even
			begins to compare with that?
			Your future contains wonders you
			can't even imagine... the universe
			could be your playground...
			Doctor Crusher and Counselor
			Troi... they're taking me to
			dinner.
			You don't have to eat, you know.
			It's just a nasty human habit you
			could easily do without.
			Hello, Amanda. Are you ready?
			Yes...
			Is there something else you'd like
			to order, Amanda?
			No, thank you. I'm just... not
			hungry.
			Actually, I don't even have to
			eat. It's a human trait.
			I see.
			How are you feeling about all this
			now? It must be overwhelming.
			It was at first. But now... I'm
			actually enjoying myself.
			Hello, ladies...
			Hello, Wil...
			Commander Riker... why don't you
			join us?
			Thanks, but I'm meeting someone.
			How are the lessons going? Is
			Q being patient with you?
			What's this all about?
			I thought it might be nice for
			us to spend some time alone
			together.
			I think you should take us back
			to Ten Forward.
			Are you sure? Wouldn't you like
			to be here with me for a while?
			The moonlight is beautiful...
			isn't it nicer here than in Ten
			Forward?
			It's very pleasant. But that's
			not the point...
			Oh... ?
			I think it is...
			No...
			You can't just snatch people away
			and put them in your fantasies...
			and expect them to respond.
			Don't you like me... even a
			little?
			I think you're a lovely young
			woman. But -- none of this is
			real.
			My feelings are real...
			I know that... but -- you can't
			make someone... love you.
			Can't I?
			Amanda...
			You're so beautiful...
			Do you love me?
			Yes... more than anything...
			You're right... none of this is
			real...
			I thought it would be romantic...
			but it's empty...
			Amanda...
			Just go back to Ten Forward...
			Bon jour, mon Capitan. You wanted
			to talk to me?
			Yes. I want to ask you about
			Amanda's biological parents. When
			they decided to remain on Earth,
			what was the reaction in the
			Continuum?
			We found it incomprehensible.
			Were they pressured to come back?
			Were they threatened with
			punishment if they didn't?
			What are you getting at, Picard?
			The circumstance of their death
			was a bit odd... a tornado that
			escaped the Weather Modification
			Net... and then touched down in
			only one spot -- Amanda's home.
			You never can predict the
			weather...
			Tornadoes develop from existing
			storm fronts... and there were
			no storm fronts in Kansas that
			day. Witnesses reported that the
			funnel materialized
			spontaneously... directly over
			Amanda's home... destroyed it...
			and then disappeared.
			If you say so. I wasn't there.
			Were Amanda's parents executed...
			by the Q Continuum?
			And what if they were?
			Then I think Amanda has the right
			to know that before she makes a
			choice about her future.
			Don't be foolish, Picard. She
			has no choice. She never did.
			If she is truly Q, she must come
			where she belongs, to the
			Continuum...
			But if she is some kind of
			hybrid... neither human nor Q...
			then I'm afraid she'll have to
			be...
			Are you that despicable, Q?
			Don't be naive. You have no idea
			what it means to be Q. With
			unlimited power comes the need
			for responsibility. Do you think
			we can allow an omnipotent being
			to roam free in the universe?
			And... what have you concluded?
			Does she live... or does she die?
			I haven't decided yet.
			Captain's log, Stardate 46193.8.
			We have arrived at Tagra Four and
			have begun delivering supplies.
			In the meantime, I am faced with
			a crisis of a different nature.
			I have no reason to believe Q is
			lying. He has orders from the
			Continuum... if Amanda doesn't
			prove herself to be fully Q...
			he must kill her.
			We have to tell her...
			I'm not sure we should... it seems
			almost cruel.
			Maybe she can protect herself...
			after all, she has a great deal
			of power.
			So did her parents, and it didn't
			save them.
			I'm inclined to agree that Amanda
			deserves to know the truth of the
			situation. We don't have the
			right to withhold such crucial
			information.
			But it won't be easy telling
			her...
			What's your impression of the
			field modulator, Mister Lote?
			Quite ingenious, quite ingenious,
			indeed...
			I'm amazed at the way it can be
			incorporated into the existing
			system.
			We're all loaded. We can head
			for the surface whenever you're
			ready.
			I'm eager to see the field
			modulator in place, Commander.
			Why don't we get going... ?
			Kill me? Why?
			They're not convinced you're fully
			Q.
			They were responsible for the
			death of your parents...
			My parents -- ?
			What right do they have?
			Answer that, Q. Or are you afraid
			to face me?
			You're such a plucky little thing.
			I do enjoy you, you know.
			Amanda's question deserves an
			answer, Q. You've made yourself
			judge, jury, and -- if necessary
			-- executioner. By what right
			do you appoint yourself to this
			position?
			Superior morality...
			I recall how you used your
			superior morality when we first
			encountered you. You put us
			on trial for the crimes of
			humanity.
			The jury is still out, Picard.
			Make no mistake.
			Your arrogant pretense to being
			the moral guardians of the
			universe strikes me as a bit pale
			today. You have shown no evidence
			that you are guided by a superior
			moral code -- by any code
			whatsoever. You may be nearly
			omnipotent -- I won't deny your
			parlor tricks are impressive --
			but morality? No, I don't see
			it. I don't acknowledge it. I
			would put human morality against
			the Q's any day.
			Perhaps that's the fascination
			we humans hold for you... ? That
			by our puny example we give you
			a glimmer of the one thing that
			eludes your omnipotence -- a moral
			center.
			If so, I can think of no crueler
			irony than for you to destroy
			a young woman whose only crime...
			is being too human.
			Jean-Luc, Jean-Luc... sometimes
			I think the only reason I come
			here is to listen to these
			wonderful speeches of yours. But
			in this case your concerns are
			unwarranted. We've decided not
			to harm her. We're prepared to
			offer her a choice.
			What kind of choice?
			You can come with me to the
			Continuum --
			Or... ?
			The other choice is more
			difficult.
			You have within yourself the
			ability to refrain from using the
			power of Q. If you can do that
			-- you can stay here.
			Then I'm staying here.
			Think carefully... it won't be
			easy. Your parents were offered
			the same choice... and they were
			unable to resist using their
			power.
			All I've wanted... since this
			whole thing began... was to be
			a normal human being again. I
			know I can resist.
			Worf to Picard -- there is an
			emergency message from Commander
			Riker.
			On my way.
			Captain, the damage to the reactor
			was greater than the Tagrans led
			us to believe. The field
			modulator is installed and
			operational, but it's not going
			to be enough... the reactor's gone
			into overload...
			Can you correct the problem?
			La Forge is trying to stabilize
			the unit now. We'll stay as long
			as possible... there are thousands
			of people in the area, and if that
			reactor goes...
			Commander -- over here, quickly!
			Is this your doing, Q -- ?
			Not this time, Picard.
			Mister Worf, see if there's
			anything we can do to cut through
			the interference and beam them
			out of there.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, La Forge is trying a
			neutrino infusion. There's a
			chance it'll smother the
			reaction...
			Sir, there is too much ionization
			in the atmosphere, transporters
			are useless.
			It didn't work, sir. Meltdown
			is imminent.
			Commander... look at this...
			This is impossible...
			I don't know what's happening,
			sir -- but the reaction is
			stabilizing on its own.
			Sir... I am reading a massive
			energy fluctuation in the planet's
			atmosphere.
			On screen.
			Atmospheric contaminants have
			dropped to less than one part
			per trillion.
			The ecosystem has been restored
			to its natural state.
			Amanda... ?
			You see? It's harder to resist
			than you thought...
			I couldn't let all those people
			die...
			Ever since I got here, I've been
			fighting this. Denying the truth.
			Denying what I am.
			I am Q.
			Doctor Crusher... I've decided...
			I can't stay...
			I can't stay here.
			Now that you've come to your
			senses, can we be off?
			No. First I'm going to visit my
			parents. And it might take a
			while to explain all this, so
			you'll have to be patient.
			I hope I can come visit you
			sometime...
			You're a Q... you can do anything
			you want.
