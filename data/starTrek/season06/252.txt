			... but then I said, "In that
			frame of reference, the perihelion
			of Mercury would have precessed in
			the opposite direction."
			That is a great story!
			Quite amusing, Professor Hawking.
			You see, Sir Isaac, the joke
			depends on an understanding of the
			relativistic curvature of spacetime.
			If two non-inertial
			reference frames are in relative
			motion--
			Do not patronize me, sir! I
			invented physics. The day that
			apple fell on my head was the most
			momentous day in the history of
			science.
			Not the apple story again.
			That story is generally considered
			to be apocryphal.
			What? How dare you?
			Perhaps we should return to the
			game.
			Let's see, you raised Mister Data
			four, which means the bet is seven
			to me.
			The bet is ten! Can't you do
			simple arithmetic?
			I don't even know why I'm here in
			the first place. What's the point
			of playing this ridiculous game?
			I am in. When I play poker with
			my shipmates, I often find that it
			is a useful forum for exploring
			different facets of humanity. I
			was curious to see how three of
			history's greatest minds would
			interact in this setting. So far
			it has proved most illuminating.
			And profitable.
			Can we get this over with, please?
			It's your bet.
			I raise fifty.
			Blast! I fold.
			The uncertainty principle will not
			help you now, Stephen. All the
			quantum fluctuations in the
			universe won't change the cards in
			your hand. I call. You are
			bluffing and you will lose.
			Wrong again, Albert.
			Red Alert. All personnel report
			to duty stations.
			We will have to continue this at
			another time.
			End program.
			We've received a distress call
			from the Ohniaka Three Outpost.
			They said they were under attack.
			Ohniaka Three... there's no
			strategic value to that outpost.
			Were they able to identify the
			attackers?
			No, sir. And we haven't been able
			to raise them since the initial
			call.
			We are nearing the Ohniaka system,
			Captain.
			Bring us out of warp, Ensign.
			Sensors detect one ship orbiting
			the third planet... its
			configuration does not match
			anything in our records.
			Stand-by phasers and photon
			torpedoes.
			Hail them, Mister Worf.
			No response.
			Put them onscreen.
			It does not appear to be attacking
			the outpost.
			They might have attacked before we
			got here.
			Or they might simply be another
			victim.
			What about the outpost on the
			surface?
			There is a great deal of
			electromagnetic interference... I
			am unable to determine whether
			there are any lifeforms present.
			Data, Worf, you're with me.
			These wounds were caused by a
			forced-plasma beam... similar to
			a Ferengi hand phaser.
			This seems pretty brutal for the
			Ferengi.
			Can you detect any survivors?
			The electro-magnetic interference
			is still making it difficult to
			get precise sensor readings.
			How many people were assigned to
			this outpost?
			Two hundred seventy-four.
			All right... we'll make a room to
			room search. Worf -- you, and
			Corelki start searching the north
			wing, we'll take the south.
			Aye, sir.
			The mechanism appears to be
			jammed.
			There's not much damage... doesn't
			look like they were interested in
			the station... just the people...
			I have by-passed the primary
			system.
			Evasive maneuvers, Ensign!
			Return fire.
			Shields are down to eighty
			percent... compensating with
			auxiliary power.
			You have killed Torsus. I will
			make you suffer for this.
			Biological organism -- Klingon.
			Biological organism -- Human. I
			will destroy you.
			Artificial lifeform. Starfleet
			Rank: Lieutenant Commander. Name:
			Data.
			Stop it!
			Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
			Captain, the alien ship is
			breaking orbit.
			Set an intercept course, Ensign.
			Fire torpedoes.
			Shields are back to full power,
			Captain.
			Very good.
			Mister La Forge?
			They're gone, sir. Our sensors
			indicate there was some kind of
			subspace distortion just before
			they disappeared... I'll have to
			study these readings before I can
			get more specific.
			Take us back to Ohniaka Three.
			Data?
			Data, are you all right?
			Yes, sir.
			What happened?
			I got angry.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 46982.1.
			Because of his unusual behavior on
			the planet surface, Commander Data
			has asked to be temporarily
			relieved of duty. Unfortunately,
			this means he will not be able to
			help us investigate a disturbing
			new change in the behavior of the
			Borg.
			They were fast, aggressive --
			almost vicious... it was more like
			fighting Klingons than Borg,
			No offense.
			None taken.
			There was another difference. I
			don't think they were part of the
			Borg collective... they acted more
			like individuals.
			What?
			One of them referred to himself as
			"I".
			That Borg also showed concern for
			a fallen comrade... and called him
			by name.
			The only Borg who ever had a
			name... was Hugh. And we gave it
			to him.
			Maybe Hugh has something to do
			with this change in their
			behavior.
			Did they show any interest in...
			assimilating you... or your
			technology?
			They seemed more concerned with
			the death of their colleague...
			and with destroying us... I didn't
			see anything that suggested they
			wanted to assimilate anyone.
			The Borg's entire existence was
			centered around the acquisition of
			technology and cultures... if that
			is no longer the case... then they
			must have a new objective. We
			have to find out what it is.
			Mister Worf, from this moment on,
			we will maintain security
			condition two. Have armed
			officers posted on every deck.
			Aye, sir.
			Number One, analyze our sensor
			readings of the Borg ship... try
			to determine whether it's
			something they constructed or an
			alien ship they captured. Then,
			run an analysis of this...
			subspace distortion they used to
			escape.
			Aye, sir.
			I'm going to contact Starfleet
			Command.
			Your positronic net checks out...
			everything looks fine.
			My internal diagnostic also found
			nothing wrong.
			I don't know what to say, Data.
			There's nothing here to indicate
			anything that would cause a
			behavioral anomaly.
			I agree.
			Geordi, I believe I experienced my
			first emotion.
			Data... no offense, but how would
			you know an actual flash of anger
			from some kind of odd power surge?
			You are correct in that I have no
			frame of reference to confirm my
			hypothesis.
			In fact, I find myself unable to
			provide a verbal description of
			the experience. Perhaps you could
			describe what it feels like when
			you get angry... I could then use
			that as a reference.
			Well... when I get angry, first
			I... begin to feel... hostile...
			Could you describe feeling
			hostile?
			It's feeling... belligerent...
			combative...
			Can you describe feeling angry
			without referring to other
			feelings?
			No. I guess I can't. I just...
			feel angry.
			That was my experience as well.
			I simply... felt angry.
			Let's say that you're right... and
			this was an emotion. How is that
			possible?
			I do not know. Perhaps I have
			evolved to the point where
			emotions are within my reach.
			Perhaps I will experience other
			emotions as time goes on.
			I hope you're right. I'd hate to
			think that anger is all you're
			capable of feeling.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 46984.6
			No additional Borg attacks have
			been reported in the past two
			days. However, Starfleet has
			dispatched Admiral Nechayev to
			take command in this sector in
			preparation for a possible Borg
			invasion.
			There will be fifteen starships in
			this sector by the day after
			tomorrow. The Gorkon will be my
			flagship. You'll have command of
			task force three, consisting of
			the Enterprise, the Crazy Horse
			and the Agamemnon.
			Understood.
			Captain... I've read the report
			you submitted to Admiral Brooks
			last year regarding the Borg you
			called "Hugh"...
			... and I've been trying to figure
			out why you let him go.
			I thought I made my reasons clear.
			As I understand it... you found a
			single Borg at a crash site...
			brought it aboard the
			Enterprise... studied it...
			analyzed it... and eventually
			found a way to send it back to the
			Borg with a program that would
			have destroyed the entire
			collective once and for all.
			But instead, you nursed the Borg
			back to health, treated it like a
			guest, gave it a name, and then
			sent it home.
			Why?
			Once Hugh was separated from the
			Borg collective he began to...
			grow and evolve into something
			more than just an automaton. He
			was a person. When that happened,
			I had no choice but to respect his
			rights as an individual.
			Of course you had a choice. You
			could've taken the opportunity to
			rid the Federation of a mortal
			enemy... one that has killed tens
			of thousands of innocent people,
			and which may kill even more.
			No one is more aware of the danger
			than I am. But I am also bound by
			my oath and my conscience to
			uphold certain principles. And I
			will not sacrifice them in order
			to--
			Your priority is to safeguard the
			lives of Federation citizens...
			not to wrestle with your
			conscience.
			Now I want to make it clear that
			if you have a similar opportunity
			in the future... an opportunity to
			destroy the Borg... you are under
			orders to take advantage of it.
			Is that understood?
			Yes, sir.
			For the past six hours, I have
			attempted to produce an emotional
			response by subjecting myself to
			various stimuli.
			Like what?
			I listened to several operas known
			to be uplifting, I watched three
			Holodeck programs designed to be
			humorous, and I made four attempts
			to induce sexual desire by
			subjecting myself to erotic
			imagery.
			What happened?
			Nothing.
			I'm curious... why are you
			ignoring the one emotion you've
			already experienced? Why aren't
			you trying to make yourself angry
			again?
			Anger is a negative emotion. I
			wanted to concentrate on something
			more positive.
			Feelings aren't positive or
			negative Data, they simply exist.
			It's what we do with those
			feelings that becomes good or bad.
			For example, feeling angry about
			an injustice could lead someone to
			take a positive action to correct
			it.
			But my study of humanity indicates
			there are some emotions that are
			harmful, such as jealousy or
			hatred.
			Those are very... strong emotions,
			and you're right -- there's very
			little good that can come from
			them.
			But, I don't think that an
			exploration of anger would
			necessarily lead to feelings of
			hate or malice.
			But what if it does, Counselor?
			What if it turns out that those
			are the only emotions I am capable
			of experiencing? Would that not
			make me a... bad person?
			Data, we've served together a long
			time... and I've gotten to know
			you pretty well... I have to
			believe if you ever do reach your
			goal of becoming human... you
			won't become a bad one.
			I wish I were as confident as you
			are, Counselor.
			When I was fighting the Borg, I
			felt angry... but as I think back
			on that incident, I realize that
			I also experienced another
			sensation. It was not the same as
			anger, but I think it was an
			emotion.
			Exactly when did you feel this...
			other emotion?
			It was just after I had killed the
			Borg. I looked down at his body
			and I.... felt something.
			If you had to put a name to
			this... feeling, what would you
			call it?
			I believe it was pleasure.
			Red Alert! All hands to battle
			stations.
			Lay in a course and engage at warp
			nine.
			We have a distress call from the
			New Berlin Colony. They're under
			attack.
			What's our ETA?
			At warp nine, we will arrive in
			fifteen minutes, thirty seconds.
			Contact the Crazy Horse, and the
			Agamemnon, tell them to stand-by
			in case we --
			Incoming message, Captain. It's
			the New Berlin Colony.
			They are... cancelling their
			distress call. Evidently a
			Ferengi trading ship entered their
			system and someone panicked.
			That's the third time today.
			Reduce speed and bring us back to
			our patrol route.
			Mister Worf... stand down from Red
			Alert. Acknowledge the signal
			from New Berlin, and then transmit
			another copy of Starfleet's ship
			recognition protocols... and tell
			them to read it this time.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain's Log: Supplemental. We
			have been on patrol for seventeen
			hours, and there are still no
			reports of any further Borg
			activity. But tensions continue
			to run high on the colonies and
			outposts in this sector.
			Come.
			I thought you'd like to see this.
			It's Geordi's analysis of the
			subspace distortion the Borg used
			to escape.
			"... an artificially created
			energy conduit."
			That could be anything.
			We don't have enough information
			at this point to --
			I don't want excuses, Number One.
			I want answers.
			Sorry.
			He was right here, Wil... in this
			very room. And I let him go.
			Pick any five starship Captains...
			give them a chance to rid the
			Federation of a mortal threat.
			I would wager that all five would
			do it... even if it meant
			sacrificing the rights of one man.
			I don't mean to sound
			melodramatic... but I've never
			thought of you as just "any other
			starship Captain." Sending Hugh
			back to the Borg was a very risky,
			a very dangerous choice... but it
			was the moral thing to do.
			It may turn out that the moral
			thing to do... was not the right
			thing to do.
			Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
			Data... am I interrupting
			something?
			Yes. But it is all right. Do you
			need me?
			Well, I wanted to see if you were
			ready to return to duty. I need
			some help on an analysis of the
			ship the Borg were using.
			I believe I am able to resume my
			duties.
			What are you doing in here?
			I am attempting to recreate the
			experience which led to my initial
			burst of anger.
			Any luck?
			None so far.
			I have nearly completed this
			experiment. May I finish before
			we return to Engineering?
			Sure, go ahead.
			Computer, reset Borg simulation to
			time index two point one.
			Increase Borg strength by twenty
			percent.
			Run program.
			Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
			Computer, reset simulation to time
			index two point one. Increase
			Borg strength by thirty percent.
			Unable to comply. A thirty
			percent increase would exceed
			safety limits.
			The computer will require the
			voice authorizations of two senior
			officers in order to disable the
			safety routine. Will you help me?
			Whoa, wait a minute.
			That thing could kill you.
			During the original incident the
			Borg presented a genuine danger to
			my life.
			With the Holodeck safety routine
			in place, I know that my life is
			not in danger. Since I am trying
			to duplicate the conditions of the
			original incident as closely as
			possible I must attempt to
			duplicate the jeopardy as well.
			Data, We're talking about an
			experiment. You can't put your
			life on the line just to prove a
			theory.
			This experiment may hold the key
			to something which I have sought
			all my life.
			This is crazy. There's got to be
			another way. Why don't you try
			something else to make yourself
			angry...
			I have tried other stimuli, but
			they have been unsuccessful. I
			understand your objections, but it
			is my life and I have the right to
			risk it if I choose.
			Well, I'm your friend and I'm not
			going to just stand by and let you
			do this.
			Red Alert, all hands to battle
			stations.
			It's confirmed. The MS One colony
			is under attack.
			Doesn't it seem strange that there
			have been two Borg attacks... and
			the Enterprise was the nearest
			ship in both instances?
			We are nearing the MS system, sir.
			I have located the Borg ship. It
			is heading away from the colony.
			Take us out of warp near that
			ship.
			Stand-by to lock phasers on
			target.
			We are within visual range.
			On screen.
			Lay in an intercept course, full
			impulse.
			Lock phasers.
			We are closing... we will be
			within phaser range in thirty
			seconds.
			Captain... sensors detect a
			subspace distortion forming
			directly ahead of the Borg ship.
			They're not going to get away this
			time.
			Picard to Engineering. Transfer
			auxiliary and emergency power to
			the impulse engines.
			Acknowledged.
			Impulse engines now at one hundred
			twenty-five percent.
			We will be in phaser range... in
			ten seconds.
			We are caught in some kind of
			energy (TECH).
			All engines back full.
			Shields are failing.
			We are being pulled inside.
			Inertial dampers failing.
			Main power is off-line. I am
			switching to back-ups.
			Picard to Engineering, can you
			transfer auxiliary power to the
			warp nacelles? Try to break us
			out by using the --
			Report.
			We have returned to normal space.
			Navigational systems are still offline...
			I will attempt to make a
			celestial fix using secondary
			systems.
			Captain, the Borg ship is directly
			ahead! It's coming about!
			On-screen.
			Evasive maneuvers.
			Shields are down to sixteen
			percent, Captain.
			Is everyone else all right?
			Security reports no other
			intruders aboard.
			Captain... the Borg ship is gone.
			Sensor logs indicate they entered
			the distortion field thirty
			seconds ago.
			They beamed aboard as a
			diversion... to give their ship
			time to escape.
			This is another change in Borg
			behavior... they left their dead
			behind instead of vaporizing them.
			Captain... this one is still
			alive.
			I've stabilized his condition.
			He's still pretty weak, but he
			should make a full recovery.
			Can you wake him?
			Yes, but I don't think it's a good
			idea. His blood pressure and
			heart rate are --
			Do it.
			All right.
			Lower the forcefield.
			What is your designation?
			I do not have a designation. My
			name is Crosis.
			Crosis... ? How did you get that
			name?
			It was given to me by the One.
			Who is that?
			The One who will destroy you.
			You are Borg... your goal is not
			to destroy us... it's to
			assimilate us into the collective.
			We do not assimilate inferior
			biological organisms. We destroy
			them.
			Tell me more about the One... does
			he have a name?
			Is he called Hugh?
			Human. Sever the spinal cord at
			the third vertebrae. Death is
			immediate.
			Why does the One wish to destroy
			biological organisms?
			Klingon. Shatter the cranial exoskeleton
			at the tricipital lobe.
			Death is immediate.
			I am Locutus of Borg. You will
			respond to my questions.
			Bajoran. Puncture the lower
			ventricle of the heart. Death is
			immediate.
			This is going nowhere. Doctor, I
			want an autopsy performed on the
			other one. Compare the results to
			what we learned about Hugh's
			anatomy... see if there are any
			recent modifications which could
			explain the behavioral
			differences.
			Run a bio-spectral analysis... see
			if this Borg is trying to send a
			subspace signal to the others.
			Aye sir.
			You are not like the others. You
			do not need to be destroyed. You
			can be assimilated.
			I do not wish to be assimilated.
			Resistance is futile. You will
			not resist what you've wanted all
			your life.
			I was like you once... without
			feeling... but the One helped me.
			He can help you too. He can help
			you... find emotion.
			Have you ever felt a real emotion,
			Data?
			Yes. On Ohniaka Three, I was
			forced to kill a Borg... and I got
			angry.
			How did it feel to get angry?
			Did it give you pleasure?
			It would be unethical to take
			pleasure from another being's
			death.
			You didn't answer my question.
			Did it feel good to kill?
			Yes.
			If it's unethical to take pleasure
			from another being's death, you
			must be a very unethical person.
			That is incorrect. My creator,
			Doctor Soong, gave me a program
			which defines my sense of right
			and wrong. In essence, I have a
			conscience.
			Do you? It didn't seem to be
			functioning on Ohniaka Three...
			when you felt pleasure from
			killing a Borg...
			Step away from the forcefield.
			Your proximity is interfering with
			my scan.
			You enjoyed it... the surge of
			emotion inside you as you watched
			the life drain from your victim...
			it was unlike anything you've ever
			known...
			It was... a very... potent
			experience...
			You'd like to feel that way
			again...
			Yes.
			You'd do anything to feel that way
			again... even if it meant killing
			someone.
			No. That would not... be ethical.
			You don't sound very sure of
			yourself. Is your ethical program
			functioning?
			Data... do you have a friend?
			Yes... his name is Geordi.
			If it meant that you could feel
			emotions again... the way you did
			on Ohniaka Three... would you kill
			your friend... would you kill
			Geordi?
			Yes. I would.
			Our current theory is that the
			Borg have established several
			transwarp conduits through
			subspace. A ship entering a
			conduit is immediately accelerated
			to an extremely high warp
			velocity. It's like falling into
			a fast-moving river and getting
			swept away by the current.
			How fast would a ship travel
			through one of these conduits?
			We don't know... normal subspace
			limitations don't apply to
			transwarp variables. Based on the
			distance we covered in our trip
			through the conduit, I'd say the
			speed is at least twenty times
			faster than our maximum warp.
			How do they open the conduits?
			The Borg ship emitted some kind of
			high energy tachyon pulse just
			before we saw the subspace
			distortion. It seems as though
			the conduits are keyed to respond
			to tachyon transmissions on a
			specific frequency.
			Is there any way for us to
			duplicate the --
			Captain. There is a shuttlecraft
			leaving bay two.
			Who authorized a launch?
			There was no authorization.
			Picard to shuttlecraft. Identify
			yourself and return to the ship
			immediately.
			Lock onto it with a tractor beam
			and bring it back.
			The tractor beam has been
			disabled... command overrides are
			not functioning.
			Captain, I'm picking up a tachyon
			surge... I think whoever's in the
			shuttle is trying to trigger the
			transwarp conduit.
			Can you tell who's on board?
			It is... the Borg prisoner... and
			Commander Data.
			Mister La Forge, can we follow
			them into the conduit?
			We got a good reading on the
			tachyon pulse they sent. We might
			be able to duplicate it.
			The question is... is Data a
			prisoner... or did he go
			willingly?
			The command overrides used to
			disable the tractor were Commander
			Data's.
			The Borg might've taken the codes
			from Data by force...
			Or perhaps Data's recent flash
			of... emotion has something to do
			with this. It may have affected
			him more profoundly than we
			realize. Either way, we have to
			find him.
			I've set up a temporary tachyon
			matrix in the main deflector. I
			think I can use it to simulate the
			pulse sent by the shuttle.
			Very well. Red Alert, Mister
			Worf.
			All hands to battle stations.
			Bring us to the shuttle's last
			known coordinates.
			Shields up... weapons ready.
			Mister La Forge?
			I'm energizing the matrix...
			emitting tachyons in the lower
			bandwidth.
			Sensors show no unusual subspace
			activity.
			All right... I'm switching to the
			secondary bandwidth.
			Nothing.
			Maybe if I start alternating the
			frequencies...
			Commander -- there is an energy
			fluctuation directly ahead... it
			is the subspace distortion...
			Take us in, Ensign. One half
			impulse.
			Power levels have dropped to sixty-seven
			percent.
			Compensating with auxiliary power.
			Report.
			Navigational sensors show we've
			traveled sixty-five light years
			from our previous position.
			Can you locate the shuttle?
			No, sir. It is not within sensor
			range.
			Maybe we can find an energy
			signature from their engines.
			Captain, you should take a look at
			this.
			I've scanned three star systems
			within sensor range... there's
			evidence of at least two advanced
			civilizations... but I'm reading
			no life signs.
			And there are indications that
			plasma weapons have been fired in
			those systems recently.
			The Borg have been busy.
			I think we've found the shuttle's
			energy signature.
			They were heading... two four
			seven, mark zero five nine.
			Lay in that course and engage at
			full impulse.
			We've traced the shuttle's energy
			signature to this point on the
			surface... but there's too much
			interference to scan the location.
			Are they intentionally jamming our
			sensors?
			It looks more like a natural
			phenomenon... there's an
			unusually high amount of EM
			activity in the planet's
			magnetosphere.
			Can we transport through the
			interference?
			I think so... but there could be
			fifty Borg down there waiting for
			us and we'd have no way of knowing
			it.
			I'd say it's a risk we have to
			take.
			Agreed. Take a well-armed Away
			Team and beam down to those
			coordinates. Have the Transporter
			Chief maintain a continuous lock
			on your signals so we can get you
			out of there at the first sign of
			trouble.
			Aye, sir. Mister Worf.
			Riker to Enterprise. We're on the
			surface... no sign of any Borg or
			Data.
			The shuttlecraft has been
			abandoned.
			The EM interference is limiting
			the tricorder range... it is
			useless beyond one hundred meters.
			There aren't any structures down
			here. They could've gone
			anywhere, Captain.
			Can you determine how long ago
			they left the shuttlecraft?
			The engine's been shut down for a
			little over three hours.
			Stand-by, Number One.
			Assuming they're still together,
			how far could they have traveled
			in three hours?
			Data can move pretty fast, even
			over rough terrain... but based on
			what we know about the Borg, I
			don't think they can move any
			faster than you or I.
			They could be... as much as twenty
			kilometers from the shuttle by
			now.
			Picard to Riker.
			Riker here.
			I'm going to start sending down
			other Away Teams. Set up a
			command post and begin mapping out
			a search plan.
			Understood, sir.
			Picard out.
			I want to use shuttlecraft for lowlevel
			reconnaissance. Have the
			designated pilots report to the
			main shuttlebay.
			Aye, sir.
			All available personnel --
			including you and me -- will begin
			assembling four man Away Teams.
			We'll leave a skeleton crew aboard
			the ship.
			Who'll be in command of the
			Enterprise?
			Any last orders?
			If the Borg should attack... don't
			wait for me or anyone else to get
			back to the ship. Take the
			Enterprise to the transwarp
			conduit and return to Federation
			space.
			Got it.
			Good luck, Jean-Luc.
			Good luck... Captain.
			I've sent out twelve teams so far.
			I've assigned your team to search
			section gamma two-five. Worf and
			I will take theta one-six once the
			final team is down.
			Who's manning the command post?
			Wallace and Towles.
			Ready?
			Anything, Mister La Forge?
			Nothing, sir.
			Mister La Forge, what if we
			modified one of our phasers to
			send out a luvetric pulse? It
			might cause a resonance
			fluctuation in Data's power
			cells...
			And then we could home in on that
			response with our tricorders. I
			thought about that. The problem
			is that the pulse would have to be
			so powerful that it would probably
			destroy Data's entire positronic
			net in the process.
			Captain.
			I think I've found something.
			Come on.
			I'm having trouble scanning the
			interior...
			Can you tell if it was built by
			the Borg?
			I don't think so. There aren't
			any Borg energy signatures.
			There's a door or a hatch or
			something about twenty meters that
			way.
			It seems to be some kind of
			meeting hall.
			It's been well maintained... it
			doesn't look like it's been
			abandoned.
			Something's wrong... I can't get
			any kind of energy signature from
			this light source.
			A dampening field. The whole
			structure could be shielded from
			our sensors. Let's go.
			Stop!
			Data... ?
			That's not Data...
			What do you mean?
			You should listen to her, Captain.
			She's way ahead of you.
			Lore...
			Right... but I'm not alone.
			The Sons of Soong have joined
			together...
			... and together, we will destroy
			the Federation.
