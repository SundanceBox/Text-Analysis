			Captain's Log: Stardate 46357.4
			We have rendezvoused with the
			starship Cairo near the Cardassian
			border for an urgent meeting with
			Vice-Admiral Nechayev.
			Come.
			Admiral, may I present Captain
			Picard.
			Welcome aboard, Admiral.
			Thank you.
			That will be all, Commander.
			May I offer you some tea or --
			Thank you no, Captain. I'm afraid
			there's no time for the usual
			pleasantries.
			I'm here to relieve you of command
			of the Enterprise.
			The Cardassian forces which were
			recently withdrawn from the
			Bajoran sector, have been
			redeployed along the Federation
			border. They've mobilized three
			divisions of ground troops... and
			their subspace communications have
			increased by fifty percent. We
			believe they're preparing for an
			incursion into Federation space.
			Are the Cardassians really ready
			for war?
			I didn't say war, Commander. I
			said incursion. Our intelligence
			reports suggest they'll try to
			seize one of the disputed systems
			along the border. We think
			they're gambling that the
			Federation won't actually go to
			war over one system.
			Will we?
			I hope we won't need to make that
			decision.
			We've decided to send the
			Enterprise to meet with a
			Cardassian representative and open
			talks. We're hoping that the
			presence of the Federation
			flagship on the border will send
			a message to their leadership
			about how seriously we view this
			situation.
			Where is Captain Picard?
			The Captain, your Chief Medical
			Officer, and Security Chief have
			been... reassigned.
			That's all I can tell you for now.
			Do any of you know Edward Jellico?
			He is the commanding officer of
			the Cairo.
			I've heard of him. But I don't
			think any of us have ever --
			I'm giving him command of the
			Enterprise this afternoon.
			Captain Jellico helped to
			negotiate the original armistice
			two years ago and I believe he is
			the most qualified person to lead
			this mission.
			The change of command will take
			place at thirteen hundred hours.
			Thank you.
			Admiral...
			With all due respect... it isn't
			necessary to give Captain Jellico
			command of the Enterprise in order
			to conduct a negotiation.
			I disagree. The Enterprise will
			be in a dangerous situation and I
			want someone on the Bridge who has
			a great deal of experience with
			the Cardassians. No offense
			Commander, but that's not you.
			Freeze program.
			You were at least five seconds
			slower this time.
			You increased the difficulty
			level, sir.
			It'll be a lot more difficult
			where we're going.
			Which is where, exactly?
			I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
			that yet.
			Captain... it would be helpful to
			know something about our mission.
			Mister Worf... I have my orders.
			I'm sure you understand.
			Now... this deflector isn't set
			properly. You have to position
			the emitter array so that it
			blocks the entire passageway or
			it's useless.
			Sorry. I guess I was paying too
			much attention to getting away
			from that last Cardassian. Or
			maybe it was the phaser blasts...
			or the falling rocks...
			I know this is difficult. But for
			now, all I can do is ask you to
			trust me.
			All right. Let's do it again.
			Mister Worf, time Doctor Crusher
			and me through the first tunnel.
			We'll pick up those five seconds
			this time.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
			sir. I'm Commander --
			William T. Riker. Class of 'fifty-seven,
			graduated eighth in the
			class. I'm looking forward to
			serving with you, Commander.
			Thank you, sir. So am I.
			I'm sure this change in command
			has taken everyone a little by
			surprise.
			Well... yes, sir.
			It caught me by surprise too. I
			must admit, I miss the Cairo
			already. But a Galaxy-class
			ship... that's something special.
			I can understand why you've turned
			down a ship of your own to remain
			aboard.
			Yes, sir.
			How many duty watches does the
			crew stand?
			We're on a standard three shift
			rotation.
			I'd like to change that to four
			starting tonight. I'd also like
			to examine your duty roster and
			crew evaluations as soon as
			possible. I want readiness
			reports from each department head
			by fourteen hundred hours and a
			meeting of the senior staff at
			fifteen hundred. Do you prefer
			Wil or William?
			Uh... Wil, sir.
			Where are my quarters, Wil?
			We've assigned you to cabin seven
			three five. That's up on deck --
			Deck seven.
			I'll see you at thirteen hundred
			hours.
			Attention to orders.
			To Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
			Commanding Officer, USS
			Enterprise. Stardate 46358. You
			are hereby requested and required
			to relinquish command of your
			vessel to Captain Edward Jellico,
			Commanding Officer, USS Cairo as
			of this date. Signed, Vice-Admiral
			Alynna Nechayev, Starfleet
			Command.
			Computer, transfer all command
			codes to Captain Edward Jellico.
			Voice authorization: Picard-delta-five.
			Transfer complete. USS Enterprise
			now under command of Captain
			Edward Jellico.
			I relieve you, sir.
			I stand relieved.
			Dismissed.
			I wonder how permanent this is
			going to be.
			I don't know... but they don't
			usually go through the ceremony if
			it's just a temporary assignment.
			Sore?
			Sore doesn't begin to describe it.
			I know. I wish I could talk about
			it.
			Most of the secondary systems were
			replaced during our last overhaul.
			I don't think they'll give you any
			problems. But you might want to
			check on the port lateral --
			I'll take care of the Enterprise,
			Jean-Luc. You don't have to
			mother me.
			How's your team shaping up?
			It's going well. But I would
			prefer more current intelligence
			on the exact lay-out of the
			installation. The most recent
			information is over two years old.
			Two years... I don't know how
			Nechayev ever talked you into
			this.
			She didn't give me a choice.
			Well, maybe there's something we
			can do to help you. We'll launch
			a class five probe just before we
			reach the border. You could pick
			up the telemetry aboard the
			shuttle.
			That would be extremely helpful.
			Wil...
			Captain... Captain...
			I believe we'll be arriving at the
			Cardassian border during delta
			shift. Please inform the delta
			tactical officer that I want to
			launch a class five probe just
			before we drop out of warp.
			I actually wanted to talk to you
			about delta a little later, sir.
			Right now, gamma shift is still
			slated to be on duty when we
			arrive and I'll be sure to tell
			Lieutenant McDowell about the
			probe.
			Is there a problem with delta
			shift, Wil?
			Well, there is no delta shift yet,
			sir. I spoke to the department
			heads about changing from three to
			four shifts, and it's going to
			create some significant personnel
			problems for us.
			So you have not changed the watch
			rotation.
			No, sir. I wanted to talk to you
			about this when we had a chance so
			that --
			You will tell the department heads
			that as of now, the Enterprise is
			on a four shift rotation. I don't
			want to talk about it. Get it
			done.
			Now that means delta shift will be
			due to come on duty in two hours.
			I expect you to have it fully
			manned and ready when it does. Is
			that clear?
			Yes, sir.
			If you'll excuse me, sir.
			Captain.
			He was your first officer for five
			years...
			And one of the finest officers
			I've ever served with.
			Of course he is, Jean-Luc. I'm
			sure he'll be fine.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 46358.2
			The Enterprise is on course for a
			rendezvous with the Cardassian
			ship Reklar. Fortunately, I still
			have time to prepare the ship and
			crew for the task ahead.
			I want you to install a bypass
			between the main phaser array and
			the secondary generators.
			I also want to run the main
			deflector pathway through the warp
			power grid and the auxiliary
			conduits through the lateral
			relays. You may have to
			reconfigure the transfer
			interface.
			The transfer interface is not
			designed for that configuration.
			It will take seven hours to make
			the changes.
			Sir... you may not be aware that
			our normal interface already
			routes auxiliary power through
			three separate relays.
			I'm aware of your current systems
			design. It's not good enough. If
			these negotiations fail, we could
			find ourselves in a war zone. If
			that happens I want to be loaded
			for bear.
			I'll get right on it, sir.
			Good.
			These stations should be devoted
			to damage-control and weapons
			status from now on. See that
			they're manned on every shift.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Data, how long until we
			reach the rendezvous point?
			We will arrive in fifty-two hours,
			thirty-one minutes, sir.
			Schedule four battle drills, one
			for each shift. Run a series of
			simulated attacks from a
			Cardassian squadron. I want you
			to conduct the exercises
			personally, Wil. Get it done.
			And... get that fish out of the
			Ready Room.
			Data, you're with me.
			I understand you served on the
			Victory.
			Yes, sir.
			I want you to increase the flow to
			the deuterium fuel loader by a
			third... we may need the extra
			capacity.
			Captain Zimbata and I used to play
			rugby together at the Academy.
			Really?
			Yeah. He was awful.
			But I was worse.
			Check the EPS power distributor,
			it sounds like you've got some
			kind of fluctuation.
			I don't hear anything.
			I'll check it, sir.
			The power transfer levels will
			need to be upgraded by twenty
			percent. The efficiency of your
			warp coils is also unsatisfactory.
			The coil efficiency is well within
			specifications, Captain.
			I'm not interested in the specs,
			Geordi. The efficiency needs to
			be at least fifteen percent
			higher.
			Fifteen percent?
			That is an attainable goal. But
			it will require realigning the
			warp coil and taking the secondary
			distribution grid off-line.
			Very good, Data.
			That's exactly what I want you to
			do.
			Taking that grid off-line will
			shut down the astrophysics lab,
			exobiology, geological research --
			We're not on a research mission.
			Get it done in two days.
			I believe that is also an
			attainable goal. If we utilize
			the entire Engineering department,
			there should be sufficient
			manpower available to complete the
			task.
			Sure, if they work around the
			clock for the next two days.
			Then you better get to it, Geordi.
			It looks like you have some work
			ahead of you.
			Yes, sir.
			Data.
			Yes?
			May I speak with you, Captain?
			Deanna... come in, come in.
			The latest masterpieces from my
			son.
			It's an elephant.
			I think.
			Definitely an elephant.
			I'm glad you're here. I'd like to
			go over the duty roster with you.
			I'd be happy to.
			But first, I'd like to talk about
			the way the change in command is
			affecting the crew.
			I've noticed some resistance.
			I wouldn't call it resistance.
			More like... uncertainty. Most of
			them have served under Captain
			Picard for several years. They
			knew him, knew what he expected.
			Now they're being asked to adjust
			to a new captain and a new way of
			doing things. They're uncertain
			how to react.
			I see your point. This all could
			be very unsettling to them...
			And to you. Perhaps everyone just
			needs some time... time for you to
			get to know and trust the crew...
			and time for them to understand
			how you want things done.
			I'm glad you brought this to my
			attention, Deanna.
			Unfortunately, I don't have time
			for a honeymoon with the crew.
			You've clearly given this a lot of
			thought, so I want you to take
			charge of the morale situation.
			Please see to it that they make
			the adjustment to the new routine
			quickly and easily.
			I have a meeting with the new
			Security Chief in five minutes, so
			the duty roster will have to wait.
			Thank you, Counselor.
			Oh, by the way...
			I prefer a certain... formality on
			the Bridge.
			I would appreciate it if you wore
			a standard uniform when you're on
			duty.
			Of course, sir.
			Commander, he's asking me to
			completely reroute half the power
			systems on the ship, change every
			duty roster, realign the warp
			coils in two days, and now he's
			transferred a third of my
			department to Security.
			If it makes you feel any better,
			you're not alone. Captain Jellico
			is making major changes in every
			department on the ship.
			I don't mind making changes and I
			don't mind hard work. But he's
			not giving me the time to do the
			work. Someone's got to make him
			listen to reason.
			He's not going to listen to me.
			I think he's made that abundantly
			clear.
			Then can I make a suggestion?
			Talk to Captain Picard. Maybe he
			can do something.
			We just need a little time,
			Commander, that's all.
			All right.
			Come.
			Are you all right, sir?
			Oh, yes.
			The last time I had to train like
			this was for the Academy marathon,
			but I'm managing.
			What can I do for you?
			It's... nothing urgent. I'm sorry
			to bother you. Good night, sir.
			My orders are to maintain radio
			silence until we've completed the
			mission.
			Well... the Enterprise will be
			monitoring your channel just in
			case you do need to transmit a
			signal.
			Bridge to Captain Jellico. We've
			arrived at the shuttle departure
			coordinates.
			Did you launch the probe I
			requested?
			Yes, sir. I wasn't aware that you
			wanted to be informed...
			Thank you. Jellico out.
			I can see why he's still only a
			first officer.
			Something wrong?
			Captain... I just want you to know
			that Commander Riker is--
			I've read your reports, Jean-Luc.
			I know you think highly of him.
			It's not simply my opinion. He's
			been decorated five times by
			Starfleet Command and offered his
			own ship on more than one
			occasion. I think if you give him
			a chance, you'll find he's an
			outstanding officer.
			Jean-Luc... let's be candid for a
			moment. The Cardassians aren't
			going to listen to reason, and the
			Federation won't give in to their
			demands. And the odds are, you
			won't be coming back from this
			mission of yours.
			I want this ship ready for action.
			I don't have time to give Wil
			Riker or anyone else a "chance."
			And... forgive me for being blunt,
			but the Enterprise is mine now.
			Well... here's hoping you beat the
			odds.
			Good hunting.
			Thank you.
			Jean-Luc...
			I believe this is yours.
			Shuttlecraft Feynman to
			Enterprise. We have cleared the
			shuttlebay.
			Acknowledged, Feynman. Good luck.
			Thank you, Enterprise.
			Now that we're on our way... I can
			finally tell you about our
			mission.
			Starfleet Intelligence believes
			the Cardassians are developing...
			metagenic weapons.
			Oh my God.
			I am not familiar with...
			metagenics.
			They're genetically engineered
			viruses which are designed to
			destroy entire eco-systems. The
			metagenic toxins are released into
			the atmosphere of a planet and
			immediately begin mutating. They
			seek out and destroy every form of
			DNA they encounter.
			In a few days, everything is dead.
			Within a month, the metagenic
			agent itself breaks down and
			dissipates completely... leaving
			every city, road, and piece of
			equipment perfectly intact.
			Leaving the planet safe to be
			conquered.
			Wouldn't using such a weapon pose
			as great a risk to the attacker as
			it does to the target?
			That's why metagenics and other
			biological weapons were outlawed
			years ago. Even the Romulans
			abide by those agreements.
			Starfleet Intelligence believes
			that the Cardassians are
			developing a new delivery system --
			one which would protect them from
			any accidental exposure to the
			toxin.
			They believe the Cardassians are
			testing a way of launching dormant
			metagenic material on a subspace
			carrier wave.
			So they could activate the toxin
			after launch... that would protect
			them from accidental exposure.
			And because the subspace wave
			would appear to be simple
			background radiation... no one
			would realize what was happening
			until it was too late.
			For several weeks, bursts of thetaband
			subspace emissions have been
			detected coming from Celtris
			Three. Those emissions may
			indicate a metagenic delivery
			system in operation.
			What do we know about Celtris
			Three?
			Very little. It was thought to be
			uninhabited until these emissions
			were detected. Starfleet believes
			there is a secret research lab
			located somewhere beneath the
			surface.
			Our orders are to penetrate the
			Celtris Three installation and
			determine whether or not the
			Cardassians are actually building
			a metagenic weapon.
			And if they are?
			Then we destroy it. At all costs.
			When I was on the Stargazer, we
			conducted extensive tests using
			theta-band carrier waves. One of
			the reasons I was selected for
			this mission is my familiarity
			with the methods used to generate
			them. Mister Worf, you're along
			for obvious reasons. Doctor, your
			job will be to locate and destroy
			any bio-toxins we find.
			Celtris Three is in Cardassian
			space. How will we get there
			undetected?
			I know where we can arrange
			some... discreet transportation.
			Set course for Torman Five.
			... if he doesn't pay up, I know
			three large Ferengi who will not
			be so forgiving.
			I didn't do it.
			We're not accusing you of
			anything.
			Then what do you want?
			We're looking for Daimon Solok.
			Why?
			I have a... business proposition
			to discuss.
			Solok is a very busy -- a very
			important man. He isn't here.
			But I could... relay a message.
			Good. Please tell... Daimon Solok
			that we're interested in arranging
			some transportation... to Celtris
			Three.
			That's a Cardassian planet.
			Yes. I understand that Solok
			runs... "cargo" there from time to
			time.
			Solok is no smuggler.
			What are you laughing at? Get out
			of here.
			Well, if Solok were going to
			Celtris for what I'm sure are...
			legitimate reasons... we would be
			interested in quietly booking
			passage for the journey.
			I don't think he would be
			interested in dealing with
			Federation spies.
			You know... I've heard that Solok
			is... quite a man...
			Why, yes... he is... an
			extraordinary man.
			That's why we came here... because
			only Solok could help us... but I
			guess there are some things even
			Solok can't do.
			It's too bad... if he had been
			able to help, I would've been
			very... very...
			Yes?
			Grateful.
			When do you want to leave?
			First Officer's Log: Supplemental.
			We have rendezvoused with the
			Cardassian ship Reklar to begin
			diplomatic talks designed to ease
			tensions along the border.
			Gul Lemec has arrived. He's
			waiting for you in the Observation
			Lounge.
			Very good.
			I'll be in my Ready Room.
			Yes?
			Captain... I think there's been a
			slight miscommunication.
			Did you want to meet with Gul
			Lemec in here?
			No. The Observation Lounge is
			appropriate.
			I see...
			Lemec is a Cardassian... and
			Cardassians are like... timber
			wolves -- predators... bold in
			large numbers... cautious by
			themselves... and with an
			instinctive need to establish a
			dominant position in any social
			gathering.
			You're trying to establish a
			dominant role for yourself by
			making him wait for you.
			I see.
			The trouble with wolves is that
			sometimes the fight for dominance
			ends with one of them dead.
			In that case the trick is... to be
			the wolf that's still standing at
			the end.
			Be certain your tricorder makes a
			precise map of our route. It will
			be easy to get lost in here.
			Aye, sir.
			I'm picking up some type of
			subspace signals, but I can't get
			a lock on them.
			That's characteristic of thetaband
			emissions. You need to
			compress the detection band-width
			to get a directional fix.
			The emission source is five
			hundred meters east of here... and
			about seven hundred meters below.
			It's all right.
			They're called lynars... a kind of
			Celtran bat. They're harmless.
			Bats...
			You're not afraid of bats, are
			you, Worf?
			Of course not.
			The bottom's a little over five
			hundred meters.
			There doesn't appear to be any
			other way down.
			This is sheer granite. We'll have
			to use fusing pitons.
			We could try to find another way
			down.
			Unfortunately, that could take
			several hours.
			You're not afraid of heights, are
			you, Doctor?
			Of course not.
			Now, remember to control your
			descent... and don't tangle the
			lines.
			Don't tangle the lines... I'll
			remember.
			Ready?
			What is going on? I have been
			waiting here for --
			I'm Captain Jellico. I believe
			you know Commander Riker, and this
			is Lieutenant Commander Troi.
			Let's get to it, shall we?
			This treatment is a deliberate
			insult to the Cardassian Union.
			I have been kept waiting here for
			over an hour.
			Then I'm sure you're ready to
			talk.
			I did not agree to admitting
			others to this meeting.
			If it alarms you, I can ask them
			to leave.
			I am not alarmed. But we did not --
			A great many people are depending
			on our efforts here, Gul Lemec.
			We don't need to quibble over
			minutiae.
			I have come to negotiate terms for
			a Federation withdrawal from the
			border, not to be dictated to by
			some mere captain.
			I can see you're not serious about
			these talks. If the Cardassian
			Union truly wishes to discuss
			peace they can send someone who
			can negotiate in a civilized
			manner.
			Captain on the Bridge.
			Let him stew for a few minutes.
			Then go in and tell him you've
			convinced me to meet with him one
			more time. Tell him I'm a loose
			cannon... that he needs to be more
			reasonable because I'm such an
			unreasonable man.
			Lemec will want to bring his own
			aides on board. Pretend to be
			worried that I'll object, but then
			give grudging permission for two
			aides, no more.
			Understood?
			Yes, sir.
			Aye, sir.
			Well, I'll say this for him...
			he's very sure of himself.
			No... he's not.
			The installation should be
			about... three hundred meters...
			This way.
			I don't suppose we're going to
			find another way to get back up
			there...
			Doubtful.
			That's what I thought.
			We need to get through here. This
			lava tube runs southwest for
			seventy meters before running into
			another chamber.
			The tube opens up a little more
			beyond this entrance. If we can
			widen the opening, we should be
			able to crawl through.
			A phaser set to level sixteen
			should suffice.
			Make it so.
			Very good, Mister Worf.
			Gul Lemec, a pleasure.
			May I present my aides, Glin Corak
			and Glin Tajor.
			Welcome aboard.
			For the past three weeks you've
			been massing troops in staging
			areas, assembling strike forces,
			and pulling ships from their
			normal patrols. We will not stand
			for this clearly provocative
			behavior.
			I see the Federation spy network
			has again provided you with faulty
			information. We are conducting
			routine training operations...
			nothing more.
			Then I'm sure you won't mind if we
			send a few starships into this
			sector for our own... training
			operations.
			Your fleet deployments do not
			concern us. However, we are very
			concerned about your refusal to
			vacate those territories along the
			border, which are clearly
			Cardassian.
			You gave up your claims on those
			territories when you signed the
			armistice. You couldn't take
			those worlds by force, so now you
			want us to give them to you at the
			bargaining table.
			Captain, please... we should
			listen to them.
			Gul Lemec, I'm sure you know that
			those systems are still subject to
			negotiation by the terms of the
			treaty.
			Negotiations which we have pursued
			in good faith. Unfortunately, the
			Federation has not been as
			forthcoming.
			So to speed up the process, you're
			preparing for war.
			We are preparing to defend
			ourselves.
			The Federation won't start a war.
			That has always been your
			position. However... I have heard
			reports that a small team from the
			Federation has already been sent
			into our territory...
			Of course, I don't believe this...
			such an attempt would almost
			certainly fail... and even if it
			succeeded, it would trigger a...
			very serious response on our part.
			I don't know what you're talking
			about.
			Then there's no need for worry.
			A short recess would seem to be in
			order.
			Very well.
			Where is Captain Picard?
			Reassigned.
			Ah.
			Well, I hope his new assignment is
			not too dangerous... it would be
			a shame if something happened to
			such a... noted officer.
			Yes... it would.
			Just a few more meters...
			Beverly, get out of there!
			Beverly!
			Doctor Crusher!
			No, sir.
			I have her.
			Are you all right?
			I think so.
			Next time, you bring up the rear.
			We're nearly there. Do you feel
			like you can continue?
			This looks like a maintenance
			hatch to the installation.
			I'm picking up three proximity
			sensors around it.
			The sensor echo has been
			established. The false image will
			only last a few minutes.
			The hatch is magnetically sealed.
			But I believe I can bypass it.
			I can't scan the other side of the
			hatch... it's been shielded.
			We have no choice.
			Remember: aim low and fire in
			short, controlled bursts.
			Ready.
			Now.
			It's a trap. Come on.
			Captain!
			The Captain...
			There are five more heading this
			way from another tunnel. Come on.
			Captain on the Bridge.
			What do you have, Wil?
			I'm not sure. We're picking up a
			lot of coded messages from a
			Cardassian planet near the border.
			Which planet?
			Celtris Three.
			Can you detect any theta-band
			subspace emissions coming from
			Celtris?
			There're some residual traces...
			it looks like there were emissions
			up until a few minutes ago.
			Open a secure channel to Admiral
			Nechayev. Priority two. Put it
			through to my Ready Room.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain?
			Those emissions you were so

			I'd say that one way or the other,
			our friends have finished their
			task.
			Have you heard from our friends?
			No.
			Let me know if you do. I'd very

			So would I, Admiral.
			A challenge.
			You should prove to be an
			interesting challenge. Possibly
			the most interesting to come
			through that door in many years.
			What do you want?
			Why... you, of course.
			Picard. Jean-Luc. Serial number
			SP dash nine three seven dash two
			one five. Son of Maurice and
			Yvette Picard, born in La Barre,
			France. Former Captain of the
			Stargazer... where you conducted
			extensive studies on theta-band
			subspace carrier waves.
			Don't look so surprised. How
			could we have designed a lure for
			the Captain of the Federation
			flagship unless we knew something
			about his background.
			All right... so you concocted an
			elaborate ruse to bring me here.
			Why?
			In this room, you do not ask
			questions. I ask them, and you
			answer. And if I'm not satisfied
			with those answers... you will
			die.
