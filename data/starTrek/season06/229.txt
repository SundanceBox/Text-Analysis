			Captain's Log, Stardate 46071.6.
			We have been called to the aid
			of a transport ship, which has
			been attacked near Rekag-Seronia.
			Hostilities between the two factions
			on that planet have intensified
			recently, threatening an important
			Federation shipping route.
			Captain, sensors have located the
			transport ship. Two Rekag battle
			cruisers are flanking it.
			Red alert. Shields up.
			Phasers on line. Photon torpedoes
			armed and ready.
			Is the transport still under
			attack?
			The cruisers' weapons are powered
			up... but...
			Sir, the Rekag ships are turning
			and heading out of sensor range.
			They don't want to take on the
			Enterprise...
			We are within visual range of the
			transport, Sir.
			On screen.
			Sensors indicate damage to the
			Dorian's sub space emitters.
			Audio communication only.
			Open a channel, Mister Worf.
			Aye, sir.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			of the Federation starship
			Enterprise.
			Captain Talmadge of the Dorian.
			Glad you're here... we took some
			shield damage from the Rekag
			ships... but we couldn't have held
			out if they attacked again.
			Do you have injuries? Can we
			assist you in any way?
			No injuries... but I'd like
			permission to transport a couple
			of guests to your ship.
			Of course...
			We're conveying a mediator to
			Seronia. I think he's the reason
			the Rekags fired on us...
			...travelling... negotiations...
			Captain, I'm losing you. Go ahead
			and beam your passengers on
			board...
			Counselor, will you see to our
			guests' needs and then escort them
			to my Ready Room.
			Yes, Captain.
			I'm Counselor Deanna Troi.
			Ambassador Ves Alkar...
			... and my mother, Sev Maylor.
			Counselor, it's imperative that
			I speak with your Captain...
			You think he's attracted to you...
			but he isn't. You offer him
			nothing...
			She hasn't been well. Could she
			be taken to quarters?
			Of course.
			Chief...
			I'll take you to meet Captain
			Picard...
			Go with him...
			Don't pursue him. I won't have
			it... I'll stop you...
			I am grateful for the
			Federation's offer to escort me,
			but if I arrive at Rekag-Seronia
			on the Enterprise, the armed
			Flagship of Starfleet, my mission
			as a Peace negotiator will be
			compromised. There must be a
			Federation transport ship in the
			area that could take me there.
			With all due respect, Admiral
			-- to put the Ambassador on
			another unarmed transport will
			only invite a second assault.
			I believe the attack on us was
			an isolated incident, nothing
			more...
			Ambassador Alkar... the
			Rekag-Seronia dispute has
			threatened Federation ships for
			many months. We are grateful that
			you are willing to undertake this
			mission... and you have our full
			support.
			Thank you, sir.
			However, we also recognize that
			safety is an issue -- not just
			yours, but the crew that escorts
			you. To send you on an unarmed
			transport puts everyone at risk.
			I think it's best if you proceed to
			Rekag-Seronia aboard the
			Enterprise.
			Then I have no choice.
			Once you get to Rekag-Seronia,
			you may conduct your negotiations
			as you see fit. Until then --
			you'll be in good hands with
			Captain Picard.
			... I understand.
			Good luck, and a successful
			journey.
			Picard to Riker.
			Yes, sir?
			Set a course for Seronia.
			That is all for today. There will
			be another class tomorrow at
			oh-seven-hundred hours.
			The skills are demanding...
			You're very disciplined.
			I believe in a strong connection
			between body and mind.
			You obviously share that
			conviction.
			Yes... Only sometimes I have a
			problem getting my body to conform
			to my mind's wishes...
			I would imagine that your
			self-discipline helps you in your
			work...
			I don't know about that... I think
			maybe my biggest asset is
			patience.
			I let everybody else talk until
			they're exhausted... then when
			I start, they're too tired to
			argue.
			You're going to need all your
			patience at Seronia... I can't
			imagine how you'll get the two
			sides talking to each other...
			Neither can I. I won't know that
			until I get there. I tend to feel
			my way through a situation...
			Deck nine. If I were empathic,
			like you... I'd have a real
			advantage.
			I thought Lumerians were
			empathic...
			Only with each other, not other
			species. So... I don't have any
			idea what you might be feeling
			just now...
			Curiosity...
			What I sense from you is very
			unusual. Serenity... calmness...
			tranquility... you seem to embody
			the very qualities you hope to
			draw out in others.
			Tell me, Counselor... have you
			ever been involved in diplomatic
			negotiations?
			Several times... with Captain
			Picard. There've been instances
			when having an empath along has
			been helpful.
			I'm sure.
			I could use some of that help.
			Would you come with me when we
			reach Seronia?
			If the Captain authorizes it, of
			course I will.
			I hope to see you again.
			You're late.
			Mother, I told you I would be gone
			for over an hour...
			You're late because of her.
			Have you mated with him yet?
			What --?
			That's what you want, isn't it?
			Mother, come in, please --
			I can always tell. The ones with
			a certain look in their eye...
			I'd better go...
			I'll tell you this... if you do,
			you will regret it for the rest
			of your life...
			Come on, Mother... you need to
			lie down...
			I'll see you later...
			Come in.
			Hi. It's that time again...
			The dreaded crew evaluation
			reports.
			Does it have to be today?
			It won't get any easier tomorrow.
			It might...
			What is it?
			I've just had a very -- disturbing
			encounter with Alkar's mother.
			Wil, she frightens me.
			The feelings I sense from her
			are -- malevolent. They're out of
			proportion -- evil.
			I understand she's been ill...
			and she's very old -- probably
			senile.
			Listen... we might all end up like
			that some day.
			You're right. Okay, let's get
			through these evaluations. When
			they're done I'm going to reward
			myself with two pieces of fudge.
			First, molecular biology.
			Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...
			She's just a bitter old woman...
			don't give her the power to worry
			you.
			You're right. Okay, let's get
			through these evaluations. When
			they're done I'm going to reward
			myself with a chocolate brownie.
			Next, Physical Sciences.
			Lieutenant Jeffrey Fratis...
			Worf to Commander Riker...
			Go ahead.
			Can you report to Ambassador
			Alkar's quarters? There's an
			emergency.
			Forty cc's inoprovaline.
			I'm sorry, Ambassador.
			She was ill... I should never have
			brought her along...
			Alkar...
			She was ninety-three... she'd
			lived a long life... I should be
			grateful for that.
			Counselor... there's a funeral
			meditation... part of our
			rituals... as an empath you're
			the only person on board who could
			perform it with me...
			I'd be glad to help...
			Captain...
			I wanted to express my
			condolences. This must be a
			difficult time for you.
			My mother and I were very close.
			It will be hard to adjust to life
			without her.
			Do you want to consider postponing
			your visit to Bironi? I'm sure
			everyone would understand...
			I'm no less committed to my task
			than I was before my mother died,
			Captain.
			I was only thinking of your best
			interests...
			They will be served if I can bring
			the Bironi and the Rekags
			together. For a lasting peace.
			Worf to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead, Mister Worf.
			Sensors have picked up a Bironi
			warship... in a parallel course
			just inside sensor range.
			Yellow alert, Mister Worf.
			Aye, sir.
			You communicate distrust... you
			announce your warlike intentions.
			It's not the way to enter into
			peace negotiations.
			I must take the necessary
			precautions. One ship you were
			on has already been attacked.
			And I think you'd agree that a
			dead man cannot be a particularly
			effective negotiator.
			Hello.
			Alkar... come in.
			The meditation... is one of our
			most sacred ceremonies.
			Hold the stone... like this...
			Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm
			gah...
			Say after me... an end to grief...
			An end to grief...
			An end to pain...
			An end to pain...
			Strength comes from love...
			Strength comes from love...
			And courage from wisdom.
			And courage from wisdom.
			... Thank you.
			Computer... today's appointment
			calendar.
			Oh-nine-hundred hours: counseling
			session with Ensign Janeway.
			Ten Hundred hours: counseling
			session with --
			Cancel them. Cancel everything
			until after lunch.
			Acknowledged.
			You wanted to see me, Doctor?
			Yes... I'm sorry to bother you,
			Captain... but I'm a little
			concerned.
			I haven't been able to determine
			the cause of death.
			She was elderly... and Alkar said
			she had been ill...
			I found no evidence of disease.
			But I did find abnormally high
			levels of neuro-transmitter
			residue in her cerebral cortex.
			What are you suggesting -- ?
			I don't know. I'd like to do an
			autopsy... but I've already spoken
			to Alkar. He tells me that
			Lumerian custom forbids it.
			Could you talk to him?
			Do you have any reason to suspect
			her death poses some kind of
			threat to the Enterprise?
			... Well, no.
			Then I can't see any alternative
			but to comply with his wishes.
			He tells me that Lumerian custom
			forbids autopsy except in cases
			where contagious disease might
			be involved.
			Could you talk to him?
			We're in the middle of a delicate
			situation. I'd prefer not to go
			to him with this unless you feel
			it's absolutely necessary.
			I might be able to find other ways
			to investigate. I'll try those
			first.
			Deanna?
			Hello...
			Please, come in.
			I thought you might like some
			company. Unless you're busy...
			Nothing that can't wait. Would
			you like something to drink?
			No.
			I'd like you to talk to me.
			About... ?
			About you. I don't know anything
			about you. And... I'd like to.
			There's not much to know. I live
			a simple life...
			What kind of woman do you find
			attractive?
			Do you find me attractive?
			Extremely.
			And... when you're attracted to
			someone... what do you usually
			do... ?
			That depends... on a lot of
			things...
			Is it really so complicated?
			It can be.
			Perhaps you overthink things...
			Deanna...
			I'm here...
			I'm sorry. If I've led you to
			believe...
			You are very beautiful... but our
			relationship can't be -- like
			that.
			Deck four.
			Wil...
			We were going to finish the crew
			evaluation reports...
			Of course, come in.
			Sir!
			As you were.
			Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
			I was just leaving.
			If there's anything else I
			need... I know where to find you.
			Yes, ma'am.
			Are you bothered by his being
			here?
			Of course not.
			Good. Because it's really none
			of your business.
			I know that...
			We were still with Lieutenant
			Fratis in molecular biology...
			Why do I think you're upset?
			I don't know. Could we just go
			over these evaluations?
			Wil, remember who you're talking
			to... you are bothered, I can
			tell...
			Look, Deanna, I'm sorry I
			intruded. When you're ready to
			work, why don't you let me know?
			I will.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46073.6.
			We have arrived without incident
			at Seronia, where two members of
			Ambassador Alkar's delegation have
			been waiting. They have joined
			us to report on the situation in
			the capital city.
			Things have deteriorated
			steadily. Rekag sympathizers in
			outlying districts have attacked
			several towns.
			I was under the impression there
			was a cease fire agreement.
			It was broken before it went into
			effect. A Rekag shuttle strayed
			into Seronian space and was
			destroyed by fighter craft.
			Naturally the Rekags retaliated...
			there's been fighting ever since.
			If they will just sit down with
			me...
			The Rekags have refused to come
			to Seronian territory for talks.
			And the Seronians won't go to
			Rekag. In the meantime -- they
			fight.
			Ambassador... the situation sounds
			volatile. Perhaps a cooling off
			period --
			These people need an end to the
			fighting now -- to delay a week,
			or even a few days, could cost
			thousands of lives.
			Then I recommend asking both sides
			if they will agree to meet at the
			coastal city of Darthen.
			Why Darthen?
			It has been neutral throughout the
			conflict. Both Seronians and Rekag
			loyalists live there. It might be
			acceptable as a compromise.
			Contact the leaders. If they will
			meet in Darthen, I will join them
			there tomorrow.
			No. I will not go with armed
			guards. I must be a man of peace
			before I can ask others for peace.
			Very well.
			Please send a message to the Rekag
			and Seronian leaders. I will join
			them tomorrow.
			... I know it must be my
			imagination... but it seems as
			though Lieutenant Pinder just --
			doesn't want me in his section.
			Why do you think that?
			He's so critical... I can't ever
			do anything to please him... and
			I try, Counselor, I try to make
			sure there's nothing he could find
			fault with...
			Give me an example of what you
			mean.
			Well, yesterday I was running
			routine diagnostics on the sensor
			pallets. They checked out...
			but Lieutenant Pinder questioned
			me because I'd allowed a point
			oh-two-three variance. That's
			well within specifications.
			He goes out of his way to
			criticize me.
			Do you know of any reason why he
			might do that?
			No... that's why I'm here.
			Maybe he's tired of hearing you
			complain.
			Pardon me... ?
			I'm certainly tired of it. How
			do you think it feels to sit and
			listen to someone whine about
			themselves all the time?
			I... didn't know I was --
			This isn't Starfleet Academy.
			You aren't going to be coddled.
			If you can't take it here, you
			might think about a transport
			ship. There's a lot less pressure
			there.
			I love being on the Enterprise...
			I don't want to be anywhere
			else...
			But if you aren't up to it... you
			don't deserve to be here. Isn't
			that right?
			I... guess so...
			Then you'd better get hold of
			yourself. Or be prepared for a
			transfer.
			I will, Counselor... thank you.
			Glad I could help.
			Here we go... Bio-filter log
			on Sev Maylor...
			Geordi, could this log have been
			damaged in any way... ?
			I doubt it. Why do you ask?
			There's a discrepancy between the
			log... and the tricorder readings
			I took just three days later.
			The tricorder shows massive
			physiological deterioration
			compared to her condition when
			she beamed aboard. It's hard to
			believe so much damage could have
			occurred in such a short time.
			Well... I could run a diagnostic
			of the bio-filter system. And
			your tricorder.
			Thanks. But the best way to get
			the information I need would be
			to do an autopsy.
			Ambassador, we've received word
			from the Seronian and the Rekag
			leaders. Both sides have agreed
			to meet with you in Darthen
			tomorrow.
			Counselor Troi has altered her
			appearance...
			She certainly has...
			Am I interrupting?
			Hello, Counselor...
			You want him... I can tell. But
			you have nothing to give him...
			Deanna, could we talk in
			private...
			And you're envious of him... you
			pretend to support him, but
			secretly you want him to fail...
			That's not so...
			Please, you must return to your
			quarters.
			I won't -- I want to be here, with
			you --
			Excuse me, Ambassador. The
			Counselor and I are needed on the
			Bridge.
			Of course, Commander.
			I don't know what you thought you
			were doing in there, but you were
			way out of line...
			All right, Deanna... just what
			the hell is going on?
			Imzadi... do you still care about
			me?
			Of course I care about you. I'm
			worried about you...
			What is all this?
			Don't you think I'm attractive?
			This just isn't... you.
			But it is.
			You want me, don't you?
			Deanna...
			I need you...
			Hey -- what is this?
			Please...
			Come in...
			Deanna... I'm leaving for the
			surface.
			You said you'd take me with you...
			I know... but that's not possible
			now --
			You told me I'd be helpful... you
			needed me...
			And I still do. You've done so
			much for me...
			Then take me -- don't leave me
			here...
			Tell me... is Liva going with you?
			She's been on Seronia for weeks...
			she knows the people, the
			situation --
			She wants to take you away from
			me...
			Deanna... you are my anchor. I
			need you more than you can
			possibly realize. Do you
			understand that? I need you,
			here... making it possible for
			me to do my work.
			I won't let her have you... I'll
			stop her...
			I will go with you... don't leave
			me... please... Alkar... take me
			with you... don't do this...
			You wouldn't have recognized her.
			Her dress... her hair... everything
			about her was...
			I'm closer to Deanna than anyone
			I've ever known...
			But last night she was someone
			I'd never seen before.
			Do you know of anything that might
			have caused her to act like that?
			No. I've thought and thought about
			it. I don't have an answer.
			Computer... location for Counselor
			Troi.
			Deck six, corridor B.
			Ambassador, we've just gotten word
			that the Rekags and Seronians are
			in disagreement about the seating
			arrangement at the conference
			table.
			I'm not surprised.
			The good news, however, is that
			the cease fire seems to be
			holding.
			And that is by far more
			important... thank you, Captain.
			Chief --
			Will you take me with you?
			Deanna, I've already told you--
			Deanna... ?
			I won't let her have you --
			Security to Transporter Room Two.
			No... let go...
			It's just a superficial wound.
			What's happened to Deanna... ?
			I don't know... every system in
			her body has elevated readings...
			Take her to Sickbay.
			Captain... perhaps we should delay
			transporting to the surface.
			No... I think you must proceed
			with your mission.
			Very well.
			Chief, transport them to the
			surface.
			Captain... I want you in Sickbay,
			too.
			We'll have to sedate her. Give
			her twenty cc's of melorazine.
			Yes, Doctor.
			How's it feeling?
			A little stiff, but otherwise
			fine.
			That'll disappear in a day or two.
			Doctor Crusher --
			I think you should see these
			readings, Doctor. Her
			neuro-transmitter levels are
			three hundred percent above
			normal...
			If you remember, I found
			abnormally high levels of
			neuro-transmitter residue in
			Alkar's mother.
			Could Deanna have picked up some
			kind of disease from her?
			I'm not sure.
			I need to do an autopsy.
			I don't care what the customs of
			Alkar's people are. I need to
			find out if there's a connection
			between what killed her and what's
			happening to Troi.
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf...
			Lieutenant Worf here, Captain.
			Mister Worf, contact the Alliance
			conference on Seronia. I
			need to speak with Ambassador
			Alkar.
			Aye, sir.
			Her brain TECH readings show
			neural transmitter production
			continues to rise.
			Captain, Ambassador Alkar is at
			the negotiation table and cannot
			be disturbed.
			Let me know the moment he is
			available.
			Proceed with the Autopsy.
			Let me know as soon as you have
			something.
			Medical Log, Stardate 46075.1.
			I have performed an autopsy on
			Alkar's mother. But instead of
			answering our questions, the
			results have created an even
			deeper mystery.
			I don't have any explanation for
			this, Captain... but when I
			examined Maylor's body... I found
			that her heart, her lungs, her
			skeletal structure... most of the
			systems in her body... were those
			of a thirty-year-old.
			How could that be? We both saw
			the woman.
			And that's not all. I compared
			Maylor and Alkar's DNA. I don't
			know who that woman was -- but
			she was definitely not his mother.
			Deanna's condition is
			deteriorating rapidly. She could
			die. There are questions that
			only Alkar can answer.
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf...
			Here, sir.
			Meet me in Transporter Room Two.
			We're going to the surface.
			Aye, sir.
			No, she wasn't my mother.
			And she wasn't ninety-three years
			old.
			Captain -- did you perform an
			autopsy against my wishes?
			Yes, and for very good reason.
			Deanna Troi is in Sickbay dying.
			Doctor Crusher doesn't know the
			cause of her condition.
			But I believe you do.
			Alkar... we need you. The Rekags
			have withdrawn some of their
			concessions... now the Seronians
			are threatening to break off the
			talks.
			I'll be right there.
			But --
			They've been arguing for hours
			in there. It seems hopeless.
			But now -- when expectations are
			lowest -- is the moment I can be
			most effective. If I am focused...
			centered... free of disquieting
			thoughts... I can turn these
			factions toward peace.
			I'm not particularly interested
			in your techniques as a mediator
			--
			Hear me out, Captain. It's
			important that you understand.
			You see, I discovered long ago
			that I had the ability to channel
			my darker thoughts... my unwanted
			emotions... to others... leaving
			me unencumbered.
			Is this... what you've done to
			Counselor Troi?
			I didn't plan it. I expected
			Maylor to live through this
			negotiation. Her death could not
			have been more untimely.
			Then... you deliberately began
			using Deanna...
			She's an empath. I was reasonably
			certain I could establish a link
			with her.
			Frankly, I was amazed when I saw
			how quickly she was aging.
			Usually my receptacles survive
			for years.
			Receptacles... ?
			Come now, Captain -- surely you
			can see there is a broader canvas
			here. If I came to these peace
			talks hindered by unwanted
			emotions... the Rekags and
			Seronians would be condemned to
			go on fighting...
			No, Alkar... you can't explain
			away a wantonly immoral act just
			because you think it's connected
			to some higher purpose.
			Do you know how many people have
			died on this planet in the last
			forty eight hours? Thousands.
			Deanna Troi is one individual.
			And you think that justifies
			brutalizing her? And the others
			you've used?
			Ask the Seronian and Rekag
			children who go to sleep every
			night in fear of their lives.
			Captain... I get no payment for
			what I do. I have no power base,
			no agenda. I am willing to risk
			my life simply to help others.
			If you think you appear
			courageous, you're mistaken.
			You're a coward. You exploit the
			innocent so you don't have to
			shoulder the burden of unpleasant
			emotions.
			This time you will be held
			accountable. I'm taking you back
			to the Enterprise to release
			Counselor Troi.
			I have no intention of releasing
			her. Now -- or ever.
			Alkar... everything's falling
			apart. You have to come now.
			Excuse me, Captain. I am needed.
			You and your Security Chief will
			leave.
			Lock on to Alkar's signal and
			bring him aboard.
			Sir, I am sure the Seronians have
			reactivated their security field.
			Then work with Mister La Forge
			to find a way to break through
			it.
			I want that man on this ship.
			Aye, sir.
			I'll be in Sickbay.
			If Alkar is flooding her with
			this... psychic waste... that
			would explain the high level of
			neuro-transmitters.
			All the negative emotions pouring
			into her have caused an abnormal
			chemical response in her brain...
			Isn't there something you can do
			to counteract it?
			Enzymic decontaminants will reduce
			the level of the
			neuro-transmitters -- but I can't
			make any headway unless Alkar
			stops what he's doing.
			He has no intention of stopping.
			He feels perfectly justified in
			using her until she dies.
			Then Deanna has to die.
			The only way to save her is to
			break the link with Alkar. And
			that will only happen if she's
			no longer an adequate receptacle.
			When Maylor died, Alkar
			immediately turned to Deanna.
			If he thinks Deanna is dead...
			he'll break the link and turn
			to someone else -- probably one
			of his delegation.
			Wait a minute... you're talking
			about... about killing Deanna...
			I'll be able to resuscitate her,
			Wil... as long as it's not more
			than thirty minutes... the
			question is -- will that be enough
			time? Unless he establishes a
			link with someone else before we
			revive Deanna he might turn back
			to her.
			We must also keep in mind that
			we're putting his next victim at
			risk... I'll want every possible
			security measure taken to protect
			that person.
			How... will you...
			I'll give her a hypospray of
			dylamadon.
			It's the most gentle way...
			Proceed, Doctor.
			Well, my friend, an era of
			conflict and bloodshed appears
			to be over...
			Alkar...
			What is it...
			I... I'm fine... just a little
			light-headed.
			You're exhausted.
			Do you want a doctor?
			No... of course not...
			Enterprise to Ambassador Alkar.
			Respond, sir.
			I'm here, Captain...
			You must return to the Enterprise
			immediately. Counselor Troi is
			dying.
			We are prepared to transport you
			from the surface whether you come
			willingly or not.
			There are security force fields
			protecting us, Captain --
			They won't protect you any longer.
			Transporter Room Two, prepare
			to energize --
			We're ready, Captain.
			Computer, note in the log that
			death occurred at fourteen thirty
			hours... due to respiratory and
			renal failure.
			Will you wait for me in my
			quarters?
			Of course.
			It is a tragic loss. But her
			death had a purpose.
			I intend to make certain that
			you answer for what you have
			done.
			Your own Federation Council has
			granted me safe and timely passage
			to my planet. I expect you to
			honor that.
			How much longer do we have?
			Three minutes, forty seconds...
			Picard to Transporter Room Two...
			lock on to the young woman in
			Ambassador Alkar's quarters...
			stand by to transport her out
			of there.
			Mister Worf, station yourself
			outside the quarters.
			Aye, sir.
			She'd helped me so much... without
			her, I couldn't have accomplished
			what I did...
			I'm so sorry... Is there anything
			I can do...
			Yes, there is something...
			If we could share the funeral
			meditation...
			We have a minute and a half
			left...
			Prepare a hypospray of cordrazine.
			Yes, Doctor.
			We'll use that in conjunction with
			the cortical stimulator...
			Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm
			gah...
			Rohm gah... sevi rohm... rohm
			gah...
			We can't wait any longer.
			Release the stasis field. Ten
			cc's of cordrazine.
			Yes, doctor.
			Cortical stimulator...
			Now.
			... an end to pain...
			... an end to pain...
			Again.
			She has a pulse... blood pressure
			climbing... ninety over forty.
			All right... let's neutralize the
			neuro-transmitters. Initiate the
			decontamination sequence...
			Levels are dropping, Doctor...
			down to four hundred twenty
			percent above normal... three
			hundred eighty percent...
			Picard to Transporter Room
			Three...
			Not yet. I won't know for
			certain that it's working until
			we get her below three hundred
			percent.
			... and courage from wisdom...
			Alkar... what's wrong?
			Neuro-transmitter levels are down
			to three hundred ten -- three
			hundred percent.
			Picard to Transporter Room Three.
			Energize.
			Let me go!
			Neuro transmitter level at two
			hundred thirty percent...
			Worf to Captain Picard.
			Ambassador Alkar is dead.
			Wil...
			Doctor Crusher thinks he must have
			been at a susceptible point in
			the meditation ceremony... when
			he was somehow vulnerable.
			Then the flow of negative emotions
			and feelings was reversed somehow --
			and went back to him.
			That's our guess. And like a man
			with no immune system... he just
			couldn't handle the sudden
			overload...
			And... Liva?
			She seems to be fine. He never
			got to the point where he could
			establish a link with her.
			When I think back on the last few
			days... it's as though I'm looking
			at a Holodeck projection... of
			someone else.
			That's kind of how it seemed to
			the rest of us...
			Thanks for sticking by me.
			I always will.
			Even when you're old and grey.
