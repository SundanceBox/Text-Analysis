			Place of birth?
			La Barre, France...
			Mother's name?
			Yvette Gessard...
			He's ready. Keep the serum at
			that level.
			What is your current assignment?
			Special operations on Celtris
			Three.
			Your mission on Celtris Three?
			To seek and destroy a metagenic

			Two.
			Their names and rank?
			Chief Medical Officer Beverly
			Crusher. Lieutenant Worf.
			What are the Federation's defense

			La Barre, France...
			Captain's Log: Stardate 46360.8
			The negotiations with the
			Cardassians have made little
			progress. Gul Lemec continues to
			insist on a complete Federation
			withdrawal from the border and I
			continue to refuse. I believe a
			military confrontation may be
			unavoidable.
			Gul Lemec, I assure you that what
			the Federation wants, above all,
			is the preservation of peace.
			Ah... peace. Of course. Then how
			do you explain the fact that a
			Federation team launched an
			unprovoked attack on Cardassian
			territory less than fourteen hours
			ago?
			I don't know what you're talking
			about.
			Then let me explain. Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard, Lieutenant Worf, and
			Doctor Beverly Crusher landed on
			Celtris Three, attacked one of our
			outposts in a brutal assault, and
			killed over fifty-five men, women
			and children.
			What evidence do you have of that?
			We have all the evidence we
			need... we have Captain Picard.
			Is he alive?
			The Cardassian Union has not yet
			decided how to respond to this
			latest provocation.
			But rest assured that we will
			respond.
			Is there any truth to what he's
			saying?
			Captain Picard and the others were
			sent to... investigate reports of
			a metagenic weapon on Celtris
			Three. It's possible they may
			have been captured.
			But if they escaped, they'll head
			for the Lyshan system -- the
			Enterprise was supposed to meet
			them there in eight hours.
			Wil, I want you to take a
			shuttlecraft and head for the
			rendezvous point. The Enterprise
			will have to remain here until the
			endgame with Gul Lemec is played
			out.
			Aye, sir.
			If Captain Picard has been
			captured... the Cardassians will
			not hesitate to use any means
			available to obtain information
			from him... including torture.
			I know.
			That's why I want you to contact
			Starfleet Command and inform them
			they should change every security
			code and protocol that Captain
			Picard might have had access to.
			That's all, Deanna.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain Picard...
			I demand to see a neutral
			representative... as required by
			the Federation-Cardassian peace
			treaty.
			Of course.
			We have already sent a message to
			Tohvun Three -- the nearest
			neutral planet. They assure us
			they will dispatch someone
			immediately.
			I hope you're feeling better now
			that the drugs have worn off.
			I dislike using drugs... but it is
			the most efficient means of
			getting information. Unless, of
			course, you were given a neuro-inhibitor...
			enabling you to
			withhold it.
			I can't imagine what information
			I have that would be meaningful to
			you.
			Please... let me remove those
			restraints.
			I understand that you are a
			student of archaeology. Did you
			know that Cardassia boasts some of
			the most ancient and splendid
			ruins anywhere in the galaxy?
			I know that the burial vaults of
			the First Hebitian civilization
			are said to be magnificent.
			Apparently when they were first
			unearthed, two hundred years ago,
			they were. The burial vaults
			contained unimaginably beautiful
			artifacts made of jevonite -- a
			rare, breathtaking stone. But
			most of those objects are gone.
			What happened to them?
			What happens to impoverished
			societies... the tombs were
			plundered, priceless treasures
			stolen... a few were preserved in
			museums... but even those were
			eventually sold in order to pay
			for our war efforts.
			That war cost you hundreds of
			thousands of lives... depleted
			your food supplies... left your
			population weakened and
			miserable... and yet you risk war
			again.
			How easy for you to judge us.
			Federation planets seem to want
			for nothing. But our planet is a
			hardscrabble world... famine is
			still a threat... it's not so easy
			for us.
			And yet there seems to be enough
			to maintain a well-outfitted --
			and well fed -- military...
			It is the military which is the
			hope of the population.
			The Federation would be happy to
			help you feed your people --
			without the need for warfare.
			Charity? I don't think so.
			Not charity... a cooperative
			effort --
			Let's not waste time arguing about
			issues we can't resolve. Would
			you care to tour the Hebitian
			burial vaults?
			Even though they've been stripped
			of funerary regalia, the tomb
			paintings are extraordinary. Any
			student of archaeology would be
			thrilled.
			What I would like... is to be
			returned to my ship.
			My dear Captain... you are a
			criminal. You have been
			apprehended invading one of our
			secret facilities... the least
			that will happen is for you to
			stand trial and be punished.
			I am offering you the opportunity
			for that experience to be --
			civilized.
			And the price for that
			opportunity?
			Cooperation.
			We need to know the Federation's
			defense strategy for Minos Korva.
			You've injected me with drugs.
			You must know that I have already
			answered truthfully every question
			put to me.
			Captain... we have gone to great
			lengths to lure you here --
			because we know that in the event
			of an invasion, the Enterprise
			will be the command ship for the
			sector encompassing Minos Korva.
			Then it seems you have more
			knowledge about the situation than
			I do.
			Wasted energy, Captain... you
			might come to wish you hadn't
			expended it in such a futile
			effort.
			Torture is expressly forbidden by
			the terms of the Seldonis Four
			convention governing treatment of
			prisoners of war.
			Are you in good health? Do you
			have any physical ailments I
			should know about?
			Beautiful, isn't it? This stone
			is jevonite. You can see why it
			is so highly prized.
			From this point on, you will enjoy
			no privileges of rank... no
			privileges of person. From now
			on, I will refer to you only as
			"human." You have no other
			identity.
			Good morning. I trust you slept
			well?
			You're thirsty?
			I would imagine so.
			Well. It's time to move on.
			I have told you what I know.
			I'm sure you have.
			How many lights do you see there?
			I see four lights.
			Strange... I see five.
			Are you quite sure?
			There are four lights.
			Perhaps you're aware of the
			incision on your chest.
			While you were under the influence
			of our drugs, you were implanted
			with a small device.
			It is a remarkable invention.
			By entering commands in this PADD,
			I can produce pain in any part of
			your body... at various levels of
			severity.
			Forgive me... I don't enjoy this,
			but I must demonstrate. It will
			make everything much clearer.
			Surprising, isn't it? Most people
			feel at first that they can steel
			themselves against it... but they
			are completely unprepared for the
			intensity of the pain.
			That was the lowest possible
			setting.
			I... know... nothing... about
			Minos Korva.
			But I've told you that I believe
			you. I didn't ask about Minos
			Korva...
			I asked you... how many lights you
			see there.
			There are four lights.
			I don't understand how you can be
			so mistaken.
			First Officer's Log: Supplemental.
			I have returned from the
			rendezvous point in the Lyshan
			system with Doctor Crusher and
			Lieutenant Worf. Captain Picard's
			fate is still unknown.
			There was no chance to go back for
			the Captain. We barely made it
			back to the Ferengi cargo ship
			ourselves.
			You were smart not to try.
			I don't feel so smart.
			Get some rest, Doctor.
			Wil...
			I want Geordi to analyze the
			readings from Beverly's tricorder.
			Tell him to scrutinize every
			detail of those caverns on Celtris
			Three.
			Aye, sir.
			Request permission to begin
			planning a rescue operation.
			Wil, I know you were close to
			him... but we don't even know if
			he's still alive.
			Under the circumstances, a rescue
			attempt would be foolhardy.
			Shouldn't we assume he is alive
			until we know otherwise? We can't
			just abandon him.
			He's gone. I'm sorry Wil, but
			you're going to have to accept
			that.
			I want those tricorder readings
			analyzed by fourteen hundred
			hours.
			Yes, sir.
			What is your current assignment?
			Special operations on Celtris
			Three.
			Do you have anything to say?
			Captain Picard was not acting
			under my orders.
			And if we wish to execute him?
			Under the terms of the Selonis
			Convention, Captain Picard must --
			The Selonis Convention applies to
			prisoners of war... which means
			you would have to acknowledge that
			he was captured during a mission
			authorized by the Federation. Do
			you wish to make such an
			admission?
			No.
			Then he will be treated as a
			terrorist.
			That is not my concern.
			There is, of course, an
			alternative.
			I'm listening.
			If the Federation agreed to a
			complete and immediate withdrawal
			from this sector... we would be
			disposed to release Captain Picard
			and forget about this...
			incident.
			I'll have to discuss this with my
			superiors.
			Of course.
			You have seven hours.
			I'll send a message to Admiral
			Necheyev... recommend that she
			reject Lemec's proposal... and
			deploy more starships along the
			border.
			And what about Captain Picard?
			I'm not suggesting that we trade
			entire star systems for one man's
			life... but we can at least
			acknowledge the fact that he was
			acting under Federation orders...
			that he is a prisoner of war.
			No.
			It would give him the protections
			of the Seldonis Convention --
			It would play right into Gul
			Lemec's hand. He's just waiting
			for some sign of weakness in our
			position before he starts making
			more demands.
			I can't believe you're going to
			sacrifice the Captain's life for
			a negotiating tactic.
			Wil, Captain... I think we're all
			concerned about --
			Are you questioning my judgment,
			Commander?
			As First Officer it's my
			responsibility to point out what
			may be mistakes in the actions of
			the commanding officer. Sir.
			Then maybe it's time you found
			other responsibilities.
			You're relieved.
			Don't make me confine you to
			quarters as well.
			Sir.
			I have every confidence that you
			will make an outstanding first
			officer.
			Thank you, sir.
			But I do not believe that I am
			more qualified than Commander
			Riker.
			I admire loyalty in an officer.
			But don't let it blind you to more
			pressing concerns.
			Yes?
			I have the report on Doctor
			Crusher's tricorder readings from
			Celtris Three.
			Give me the short version.
			Nothing.
			Not quite that short.
			There's nothing out of the
			ordinary on any of the tricorder
			logs. Just normal scans of the
			caverns on Celtris Three and a few
			tactical scans of armed
			Cardassians.
			They went to a lot of trouble to
			lure a Federation team to that
			planet... why?
			It is possible that the
			Cardassians were interested in
			specifically capturing Captain
			Picard.
			What makes you say that?
			The metagenic weapon which they
			were supposedly developing used a
			theta-band subspace delivery
			system. Captain Picard is one of
			only three Starfleet Captains with
			extensive experience in testing
			theta-band devices. The other two
			are no longer in Starfleet.
			So they tailored a fake weapon to
			lure Picard. But why? They
			must've known we'd change all his
			access codes and security
			protocols.
			Maybe they're more interested in
			something he did in the past...
			something that happened while he
			was Captain of the Enterprise.
			Or maybe something that he was
			going to do in the future.
			In case of a Cardassian attack,
			the Enterprise will be assigned as
			the command ship for this sector.
			If the Cardassians got wind of
			that...
			They might have assumed Captain
			Picard would know those defense
			plans.
			If our theory is correct, it would
			mean the Cardassians are preparing
			for an attack somewhere in this
			sector.
			The question is, where?
			Geordi, I want you to conduct a
			discreet scan of Gul Lemec's ship.
			Look for anything unusual...
			anything that might indicate where
			they've been lately.
			Aye, sir.
			If Captain Picard is aware of our
			defense plans for this sector, we
			could be at a serious tactical
			disadvantage.
			Admiral Nechayev just transmitted
			the plans to me this afternoon.
			Picard never saw them.
			In that case, he may be tortured
			for information that he does not
			have.
			I want you to be very careful with
			your wompat from now on, Jil Orra.
			Now that she's separated from her
			mother, she depends on you.
			I will, father.
			Do humans have mothers and
			fathers?
			Yes, but... human mothers and
			fathers don't love their children
			as we do... they're... not the
			same as we are.
			Will you read to me tonight?
			Yes, of course I will.
			I'll see you later.
			Your daughter... is lovely...
			Yes... I think so. And unusually
			bright.
			Amazing, isn't it... the way
			they're able to sneak into your
			heart... I must admit, I was
			completely unprepared for the
			power she had over me... from the
			moment she was born.
			I'm surprised... that you'd let
			her come in here...
			Why?
			To let a child be exposed to
			this... to someone who is injured
			and suffering... to see that you
			inflict that suffering...
			From the time Jil Orra could crawl
			she has been taught about the
			enemies of the Cardassians. And
			that enemies deserve their fate.
			Be careful, Madred. When children
			learn to devalue others... they
			can devalue anyone. Even their
			parents.
			To her, I am a hero. I am the
			most powerful man she knows... she
			adores me...
			Now, perhaps. What will happen
			when she's fifteen? Twenty? Are
			you prepared for the time when she
			might look at you and see you for
			what you are -- and despise you
			for it?
			What a blind, narrow view you
			have. What an arrogant man you
			are.
			What do you know of Cardassian
			history?
			I know that once you were a
			peaceful people, that you had a
			rich spiritual life --
			And what did peace and
			spirituality get us? People
			starved by the millions. Bodies
			went unburied -- disease was
			rampant. The suffering was
			unimaginable.
			Since the military took over
			hundreds of thousands more have
			died --
			But we -- are -- feeding -- the --
			people.
			We acquired territory during the
			wars... we developed new
			resources... we initiated a
			rebuilding program... we have
			mandated agricultural programs.
			That is what the military has done
			for Cardassia.
			Because of that... my daughter
			will never have to worry about
			going hungry.
			Her belly may be full... but her
			spirit will be empty.
			Be careful... you're showing
			weakness...
			Shall we begin again? How many
			lights are there?
			What lights?
			The answer is no, Gul Lemec. We
			won't be frightened away from a
			system which is legitimately ours.
			A brave stand.
			But I think you have an
			expression... something about
			discretion often being the better
			part of valor.
			Good-bye, Captain.
			The Reklar has gone to warp...
			they are returning to Cardassian
			space.
			At least for the moment...
			Captain, I think we've got
			something.
			It looks like there was some minor
			hull degradation along their warp
			nacelles. The distribution
			pattern indicates a recent
			exposure to a molecular dispersion
			field.
			Where could they have run into a
			dispersion field?
			They're found in certain types of
			quasars... proto-stellar
			nebulae... some dark matter
			clouds...
			Isn't there a proto-stellar nebula
			near the border?
			The McAllister C-Five Nebula is
			located just over the border...
			approximately seven light years
			from Federation space.
			Could there be Cardassian ships
			inside the McAllister Nebula?
			It's possible... but they couldn't
			stay in there very long. The
			particle flux in the nebula would
			begin to degrade a ship's hull
			after about seventy- two hours.
			Is there a Federation system near
			the McAllister Nebula that might
			interest the Cardassians?
			Minos Korva is only eleven light
			years from the Nebula... and the
			Cardassians tried to annex it
			during the war...
			Data, I want to be at Minos Korva
			in one hour.
			Aye, sir.
			Set course three five zero mark
			two one five and engage at warp
			eight point five.
			... le pont d'Avignon... on y
			danse... on y danse... sur le pont
			d'Avignon...
			On y danse surtout...
			Wake up.
			Where were you?
			At home... Sunday dinner... we
			would sing, afterward...
			What a charming picture. The
			Picard family... voices raised in
			song...
			Is this what's kept you from
			breaking? Images of happier
			times? Memories of home and
			hearth?
			There is a refuge in the mind...
			a place where even you can't
			intrude...
			I must congratulate you. You're
			remarkably strong willed. I see
			no point in holding you further.
			You may go...
			Someone will give you clean
			clothing before we return you to
			your ship.
			We will get what we need from the
			human female.
			What female are you referring to?
			The human who was part of your
			abortive assault team, of course --
			Doctor Beverly Crusher.
			What have you done with her?
			Not a thing. She's quite safe.
			I wanted to finish my interviews
			with you before I interrogated
			her. I had thought it might not
			be necessary.
			What about Lieutenant Worf?
			He left us few options. We had to
			kill him.
			I'm more optimistic about getting
			what we need from the woman.
			Doctor Crusher has no information
			about any of Starfleet's plans.
			She is a medical officer.
			You may be right. I'll have to
			determine that for myself.
			Are you... choosing to stay with
			me?
			Excellent! I can't tell you how
			pleased that makes me.
			Starfleet now believes the
			Cardassians are preparing to
			invade Minos Korva.
			That will not be allowed to
			happen. The Sutherland, the
			Berlin, and the Aries have been
			dispatched to this sector. But
			they're still three days away.
			Until they arrive, it's up to us.
			I'm convinced that their invasion
			fleet is hiding in the McAllister
			Nebula. I intend to hit them
			before they leave it.
			I thought the nebula was in
			Cardassian territory.
			That's right.
			I was just part of an undercover
			mission into Cardassian
			territory... I felt it was
			justified in order to destroy a
			weapon that was potentially
			catastrophic.
			But you're talking about a first
			strike. An act of war. I can't
			believe that Starfleet would
			condone it.
			Admiral Necheyev knows my plan...
			and has given me full
			discretionary powers to act as I
			see fit.
			What if you're wrong, Captain?
			What if the Cardassians are in
			that nebula for scientific
			research?
			You'd have to have pretty good
			evidence to convince me of that.
			You're still gambling with
			hundreds of lives.
			But there are two million
			colonists on Minos Korva. If we
			wait until the Cardassians
			attack... tens of thousands of
			innocent people could be killed.
			This discussion is moot. The plan
			has been approved and we're going
			ahead. Mister Data, by your
			calculations, how long could the
			Cardassian ships stay in the
			nebula?
			In another seventeen hours, their
			hull degradation will reach
			dangerous levels.
			They will have to leave before
			that.
			All right... Worf, prepare a
			series of five hundred anti-matter
			mines with magnetic targeting
			capabilities. Geordi, we're going
			to need a shuttle specially
			outfitted to operate in the nebula
			by fourteen hundred hours.
			Beverly, you'll need to --
			Have Sickbay ready for the
			casualties you're about to send
			me.
			That's right.
			Dismissed.
			Ah. You're awake.
			Please... have something to eat.
			I insist.
			Here... boiled taspar egg... a
			delicacy I'm happy to share with
			you.
			Wonderful! Wonderful! I like
			you, human... most people become
			ill at the sight of live taspar...
			I remember the first time I ate
			live taspar... I was four years
			old and living on the streets of
			Lakat... there was a band of
			children, four, five, six years
			old... some even smaller...
			desperately trying to survive...
			We were thin, scrawny little
			animals... constantly hungry,
			always cold... we slept together
			in doorways, like packs of wild
			gettles, for warmth...
			Once I found a nest... taspars had
			mated and built a nest in the eave
			of a burnt-out building... and I
			found three eggs in it.
			It was like finding treasure. I
			cracked one open on the spot and
			ate it... very much as you just
			did. I planned to save the other
			two... they would keep me alive
			for another week... but of course
			an older boy saw them and wanted
			them.
			He had to break my arm, but he got
			the eggs.
			I see...
			Unlike you, I had no pleasant
			refuge in my mind... gentle
			memories of family gatherings...
			No... I'm sure you didn't.
			How rewarding it must be now to
			repay others for all those years
			of misery.
			What do you mean?
			Torture has never been a reliable
			means of extracting information...
			it is ultimately self-defeating as
			a means of control... and so one
			wonders why it is still practiced.
			The only possible reason must
			be... pleasure.
			I fail to see where this analysis
			is leading.
			Madred, when I look at you now, I
			won't see a powerful Cardassian
			officer... but a small boy weeping
			because he was powerless to
			protect himself.
			Be quiet --
			In spite of what you have done to
			me... I find you a pitiable man --
			Picard -- stop it or I will turn
			this on and leave you here in
			agony all night --
			You called me "Picard"...
			What are the Federation's defense
			plans for Minos Korva?
			There are four lights.
			There are five lights. How many
			do you see now?
			You are four years old... weak and
			helpless... you cannot harm me...
			How many?
			Sur le pont... d'Avignon... on y
			danse... on y danse...
			Report.
			Each container holds a hundred
			anti-matter mines with magnetic
			targeting capabilites. When the
			mines are ejected from the
			containers, they will attach
			themselves to the hulls of the
			Cardassian ships.
			Good. The nebula's going to play
			hell with subspace
			communications... will we still be
			able to detonate the mines on
			command?
			We are modifying the receiver
			assemblies on each unit.
			Excellent.
			How are we doing?
			Almost done, sir. I've shielded
			the engine nacelles and the
			transporter system so they won't
			be affected by the nebula's
			particle flux.
			Good.
			Been awhile since I flew one of
			these... you're a pilot yourself,
			aren't you Geordi?
			Yes, sir.
			Began my career as a shuttle pilot --
			on the Jovian Run. Jupiter to
			Saturn and back... once a day,
			every day.
			I was on that run for a while.
			Then you must've done Titan's
			Turn.
			Oh, yeah... set a course directly
			for Titan... hold it until you're
			just brushing the atmosphere...
			then throw the helm hard over and
			whip around the moon at point
			seven c.
			And pray like hell nobody saw you.
			Well... this trip into the
			nebula's going to need someone who
			can do Titan's Turn in their
			sleep.
			The mines will have to be laid
			within two kilometers of the
			Cardassian ships. But the
			particle flux from the nebula will
			blind all the sensors except for
			the proximity-detector. You're
			going to need quite a pilot to
			bring that off.
			And is that you?
			No sir, it's not. The man you
			want... is Commander Riker.
			He's the best there is.
			Come in.
			Am I disturbing you?
			Not at all.
			Musician?
			That's right.
			Classical? Contemporary?
			Jazz.
			Ah.
			Is there something I can do for
			you, Captain?
			Are you aware of our plans to
			attack the Cardassian invasion
			fleet?
			Yes, sir. And I understand you've
			been talking to every shuttle
			pilot on board.
			I don't settle for second best.
			In anything.
			Yes, sir.
			Let's drop the ranks for a moment.
			I don't like you. I think you're
			insubordinate. Arrogant.
			willful. I don't think you were
			a particularly good first officer.
			But... you're also the best pilot
			on the ship.
			As long as the ranks are down,
			Captain, let me say that I don't
			like you, either. You're arrogant
			and closed-minded. You have to
			control everything and everyone.
			You don't provide an atmosphere of
			trust, you don't inspire the crew
			to want to go out of their way for
			you, and you get everybody wound
			up so tight there's no joy in
			anything. I don't think you're a
			particularly good Captain.
			I won't order you to fly this
			mission. I'm here to ask.
			Then ask.
			Will you pilot the shuttle,
			Commander?
			Yes.
			You're welcome.
			The shuttle is about to enter the
			nebula.
			Yellow Alert. Raise shields and
			charge all defensive systems.
			Helm, bring us to ten thousand
			kilometers from the nebula's
			perimeter.
			All defensive systems are powered
			and ready.
			The shuttle has entered the
			nebula.
			We've lost primary navigation...
			switching to secondary systems...
			Inertial dampers compensating...
			Sensors inoperative.
			Right on schedule.
			The proximity detector is
			working... we should pick up their
			ships at a distance of... five
			hundred meters.
			Don't make this too easy...
			Hang on!
			Do I want to know how close that
			was?
			No.
			Get ready to deploy the mines.
			Captain -- the shuttlecraft is
			emerging from the nebula.
			Enterprise to shuttle -- were you
			successful, Commander?
			Aye, sir. The mines are laid.
			Very well.
			Red Alert. Stand by to detonate
			the mines on my command.
			Standing by.
			Open a channel to the Reklar.
			This is Cardassian territory,
			Captain. Your presence here is
			another deliberate provocation to --
			I'm not going to argue with you,
			Gul Lemec. Every one of your
			ships has a mine on its belly, my
			finger's on the button, and you're
			in a very bad position.
			You can't intimidate us.
			Mister Worf... set off Alpha-four
			two..
			Aye, sir.
			That was just a baby... the big
			boys are sitting on your hull...
			waiting for me to say the word.
			What are... your terms?
			Your ships will leave the nebula
			one by one. Each ship will eject
			its primary phaser coil before
			setting course for the nearest
			Cardassian base.
			That will leave us defenseless.
			Mister Worf, prepare to detonate --
			I will agree to your terms.
			Excellent.
			Oh... one more thing. I believe
			you're holding a Starfleet officer
			named Jean-Luc Picard. I expect
			him returned. Immediately.
			That won't help. I have many
			others.
			...still... felt good...
			Enjoy your good feelings when you
			can. There may not be many more
			of them.
			I've just received word. There's
			been a battle. The Enterprise is
			burning in space. The invasion of
			Minos Korva has been successful.
			...don't... believe you...
			There is no further need for
			information from you... our troops
			were successful in spite of your
			refusal to help me.
			You might have saved yourself a
			great deal of torment by yielding
			at the beginning.
			I... want to see... neutral
			representative...
			There is no such person.
			The word will be that you perished
			with your crew. No one will ever
			know that you are here with us.
			As you will be, for a long, long
			time.
			You do, however, have a choice.
			You can live out your life in
			misery... held here, subject to my
			whims...
			Or you can live in comfort, with
			good food and warm clothing...
			women as you desire them...
			allowed to pursue your studies of
			philosophy and history.
			I would enjoy debating with you.
			You have a keen mind.
			It's up to you. A life of ease...
			of reflection and intellectual
			challenge...
			Or this.
			What... must I... do... ?
			Nothing, really.
			Tell me how many lights you see.
			How many? How many lights?
			This is your last chance... the
			guards are coming... don't be a
			stubborn fool...
			How many?
			You told me he would be ready to
			go.
			We had some unfinished business.
			Get him cleaned up. A ship is
			waiting to take him back to the
			Enterprise.
			Captain Picard... if you will go
			with the guards, they'll take care
			of you.
			There are four lights.
			Captain on the Bridge.
			Welcome home, Jean-Luc.
			Thank you.
			Just the way you left it. Maybe
			a little better.
			Computer transfer all command
			codes to Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			Voice authorization: Jellico-alpha-three-one.
			Transfer complete. USS Enterprise
			now under command of Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			I relieve you, sir.
			I stand relieved.
			It's been an honor serving with
			you.
			You have the Bridge, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			I don't know where to begin,
			Counselor. It was... quite an
			experience.
			I read your report.
			One thing I didn't put in my
			report... at the very end, he
			offered me a choice... between a
			life of comfort... or more
			torture... all I had to do was say
			there were five lights.
			You didn't say it...
			No... but I was going to. I was
			ready to tell him anything he
			wanted... anything at all. But
			more than that, I was beginning to
			believe there were five lights.
