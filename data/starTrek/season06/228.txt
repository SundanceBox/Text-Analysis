			Captain's Log, Stardate 46041.1.
			We have located the U.S.S.
			Yosemite, a Starfleet science
			vessel sent to the Igo Sector to
			observe a remote plamsa streamer.
			The ship has not been heard from
			in several days.
			Magnify.
			The last report we have says they
			were observing the streamer at
			medium range. Maybe they went
			in for a closer look... got more
			than they bargained for.
			Hail them.
			No response.
			Life signs?
			Our scanners cannot penetrate the
			plasma streamer's distortion
			field.
			Can we tractor the vessel out?
			No, sir -- the ionic interference
			is too heavy.
			I'll take a shuttle.
			Too risky -- you could be pulled
			in, too.
			Bridge to Engineering -- Geordi,
			can we beam an Away Team onto the
			science ship?
			We can beam them over there,
			Captain -- but with all this
			interference, we might not get
			a positive lock to bring them
			back.
			Commander... what if we bridged
			our Transporter system with
			theirs? It might be enough to
			cut through the ionic field.
			To do that, we'd have to activate
			the Yosemite's Transporters by
			remote...
			No problem, sir. I can
			reconfigure their controller to
			accept commands from here.
			Good idea, Reg.
			Captain, I think we can do it.
			We're gonna bridge the two
			Transporter systems.
			Acknowledged. Meet Commander
			Riker in Transporter Room Three.
			Aye sir.
			Barclay -- I'll need a systems'
			engineer on this Away Team.
			I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you.
			I meant you, Barclay.
			Shouldn't I stay here and set up
			the remote link?
			Dern can handle that. Let's go.
			Status, Mister O'Brien?
			You're in for a bumpy ride,
			Commander.
			I'll have to send you over one
			at a time... because of band-width
			limitations. And the transport
			cycle will take a bit longer.
			How much longer?
			Four, five seconds... about twice
			the normal time.
			What do you... what exactly do
			you mean by a bumpy ride?
			There may be a small amount of
			static charge accumulation.
			You'll feel a bit of tingling --
			nothing to worry about.
			Let's do it.
			Engaging system interlock...
			Pattern buffers synchronized...
			Phase transition coils at
			stand-by...
			Energizing.
			He's there.
			Engaging interlock...
			Buffers synched...
			Energizing.
			I'll go next.
			Engaging interlock...
			Buffers synched...
			Whoa, wait a minute...
			I'm reading an ionic fluctuation
			in the matter stream... No
			problem.
			Okay... Energizing.
			Barclay.
			Aye sir...
			Engaging interlock...
			Buffers in synch...
			Phase coils...
			I'm sorry -- I can't do this.
			You were faced with a difficult
			transport, Reg. Anyone would have
			been apprehensive in that
			situation.
			Tell that to Commander La Forge
			and the rest of the Away Team...
			I'm sure they understand. As soon
			as you feel up to it, you can
			probably still join them --
			No.
			Reg... is there something you're
			not telling me?
			Actually, this isn't the first
			time I've been... apprehensive.
			Every single time I've had to do
			it, I've had a certain feeling
			of... I guess you could call it...
			... mortal terror.
			I see. How long have you had this
			fear of transporting?
			Why have you kept it a secret?
			Why? My career in Starfleet would
			be over, that's why.
			I doubt that.
			I usually manage to avoid it
			somehow. You wouldn't believe
			how many hours I've logged on
			shuttlecrafts...
			The thought of being deconstructed
			molecule by molecule. It's more
			than I can stand...
			Ever since I was a child, I've
			been scared to death that if I
			ever dematerialized... I wouldn't
			come back whole again.
			I know it sounds crazy.
			There's nothing crazy about it,
			Reg -- you are being taken apart
			molecule by molecule. You're not
			the first person to have anxiety
			about transporting.
			We can desensitize you to this
			type of fear. It's a slow and
			gradual process... but it works.
			It does... how?
			Well... the first step might
			be a relaxation technique. Like
			Plexing.
			Plexing?
			It's a Betazoid method. The next
			time you feel nervous about
			transporting, you would stimulate
			a neural pressure point -- like
			this...
			There's a nerve cluster just
			behind the carotid artery -- it
			stimulates the part of the brain
			that releases natural endorphins.
			Plexing... sounds easy enough...
			You know, I feel better already.
			I can do this.
			Reg... there's no need to rush...
			No, no, no. We've talked before
			about confronting my fears. "The
			best way out is through." You
			said that once, remember?
			I suppose I did...
			I'm going to beam over there.
			I can do it.
			No sign of survivors. No sign
			of a anyone.
			Maybe they abandoned ship.
			Unlikely. Both escape pods are
			still on board.
			Well, there was an explosion in
			here. We know that much.
			Any idea what caused it?
			I've ruled out a reactor core
			failure... and there's no sign
			of a systems overload.
			Blast analysis indicates the
			explosion originated...
			...here. In the center of this
			transport chamber.
			How is that possible? The
			Transporter is still functional.
			Could someone have beamed an
			explosive device aboard?
			Commander Riker...
			Lieutenant Joshua Kelly -- he
			was the ship's engineer.
			How did he die?
			There's evidence of burns... but
			they don't look serious enough
			to have killed him... I'm going
			to have to take him back for an
			autopsy.
			You're sure about this, sir?
			I'm sure. Please proceed.
			This'll only take a minute...
			Should be a smooth ride over, sir.
			Good... good...
			I know how you feel about this,
			sir.
			You... you're afraid of
			transporting?
			No -- of arachnids.
			Spiders. Sickening, crawly little
			things, don't you think? All
			those legs...
			They've never bothered me.
			A few years back, I was called
			in to re-route an emitter array
			at a Starbase on Zayra Four.
			Turns out the entire system was
			infested with Talarian hook
			spiders.
			Ever see a Talarian hook spider?
			Their legs are half a meter long.
			Anyway, I had a choice. Do I walk
			away and let the emitter blow
			itself to hell... or do I crawl
			into a Jeffries Tube with twenty
			hook spiders?
			What happened?
			It was the hardest thing I ever
			did. But I got through it. After
			that, I was never quite as afraid
			of spiders.
			Thanks...
			Energizing.
			Welcome aboard, Reg. Ready to
			work?
			Yes, sir.
			Good. Start by downloading the
			ship's science logs. Over
			there...
			Aye sir.
			Still four members of the crew
			unaccounted for. You come up with
			anything?
			I don't know how these fit in,
			but... I found them near the
			Transporter platform.
			What are they?
			They look like pieces of a
			standard sample container.
			Take them back to the ship. We'll
			analyze them later.
			Glad you could join us, Mister
			Barclay.
			Me too, sir.
			The Ferengi are claiming two of
			their freighters were destroyed
			by a Cardassian warship in your
			sector.
			Is there any evidence to support
			this?
			Although I'm loathe to believe
			the Ferengi about anything...
			there was evidence of Cardassian
			weapons.
			If the Cardassians also attacked the
			Yosemite... it could indicate
			a large-scale movement into this
			sector.
			I have an Away Team aboard the
			ship now. Their initial report
			indicates an explosion on board.
			But we're not sure if it was from
			an attack...
			How long until you'll know?
			A few hours. If it does look like
			the Cardassians, I'll contact you
			immediately.
			Very well.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Mister Data?
			The Away Team is returning to the
			Enterprise.
			Acknowledged. Have Commander
			Riker join me in my Ready Room
			as soon as he's on board.
			Aye sir.
			La Forge to Transporter Room
			Three.
			I'm ready to go.
			Stand by, Commander.
			Barclay to Enterprise...
			One to beam back.
			Stand by, sir.
			You see, sir? That wasn't so bad,
			was it?
			Captain's Log, supplemental. Our
			investigation has revealed there
			was an explosion aboard the
			Yosemite -- possibly the result
			of an attack. We are still
			analyzing data obtained by the
			Away Team.
			Mission logs... science logs...
			medical logs -- they're all
			completely scrambled. It looks
			like the blast wiped out the
			ship's core memory.
			We could try to reconstitute the
			data stream.
			It's worth a try.
			Commander... has anything...
			strange ever happened to you
			during transport?
			Like what?
			I don't know... anything out of
			the ordinary...
			Not really...
			This looks hopeless -- we're not
			gonna get anything from the
			logs...
			Maybe this broken sample
			container I found can tell us
			something...
			Right...
			Let's try to get this thing back
			in one piece...
			I mean -- have you ever seen
			anything?
			Where?
			In the... during transport.
			Sometimes my VISOR picks up
			resonance patterns from the
			matter-energy conversion. It's
			actually kind of pretty.
			Why?
			Just wondering...
			Reg -- what are you getting at?
			Do you think you saw something
			during transport?
			When I was returning to the
			Enterprise... I could've sworn
			I saw something... in the matter
			stream.
			Something?
			There was phased matter all
			around... at first I thought it
			was some kind of energy discharge.
			But then it flew toward me... and
			touched my arm...
			But how could anything be in
			there... the molecules flying
			apart... half-phased... it's...
			It's... impossible, isn't it?
			We'd better check it out. When
			we're done here, let's run a full
			Transporter diagnostic. Alright?
			Alright.
			The confinement beam subsystems
			check out. So do the phase
			transition coils.
			The pattern buffer's fine.
			Emitter pad... targeting scanner
			-- they're all running normally.
			This system's clean... so is the
			science vessel's.
			There's a lot of energy floating
			around in the beam. Maybe you
			saw a surge in the matter stream.
			Yeah...
			I'll run a scan on the Heisenberg
			compensators...
			No... you've done more than enough
			already, Chief...
			No problem at all. Why don't you
			give me a hand?
			Maybe ignorance really is bliss...
			Sir?
			If I didn't know so much about
			these things... maybe they
			wouldn't scare me so much...
			I can still remember the day in
			Doctor Olafson's class on
			Transporter Theory when he talked
			about the body being converted
			into billions of kiloquads of
			data... zipping through
			subspace... and I realized,
			there's no margin for error. One
			atom out of place and poof! You
			never come back...
			It's amazing people don't get lost
			all the time.
			With all due respect sir -- I've
			been doing this for twenty-two
			years, and I haven't lost anybody
			yet.
			Yes, but... you realize if these
			imaging scanners are off by even
			a thousandth of a percent --
			That's why each pad has four
			redundant scanners. If any one
			scanner fails, the other three
			take over.
			How many Transporter accidents
			have there been in the last ten
			years, Reg? Two... three? What
			about the millions of people who
			transport every day without a
			problem?
			I've... I've heard about
			problems... what about...
			Transporter Psychosis?
			Transporter Psychosis -- there
			hasn't been a case of that in over
			fifty years. Not since they
			perfected multiplex pattern
			buffers.
			Transporting really is the safest
			way to travel, Reg.
			I want to take a closer look at
			those burns.
			Take a tissue sample.
			Yes, Doctor.
			Damage to the epidermis only...
			Initiate a circulatory probe.
			Doctor Crusher...
			His heart is beating.
			Cardio-stimulator -- now.
			It's gone.
			Neuro-electrical activity in the
			cerebral cortex.
			Nothing.
			Now the respiratory system's
			active. What the hell's going
			on...
			Endocrine system's functioning...
			now the lymphatic system...
			the pancreas...
			Just water, please.
			Thanks.
			Water, ten degrees celsius.
			Computer... access Starfleet
			Medical Data Base. Tell me
			about... describe the disorder
			known as... Transporter Psychosis.
			Transporter Psychosis was
			diagnosed in the year
			twenty-two-oh-nine by researchers
			on Delinia Two --
			No, no... stop. All I need is
			the... what causes it?
			It is caused by a breakdown of
			neuro-chemical molecules during
			transport, affecting the body's
			motor functions, autonomic
			systems, and the brain's higher
			reasoning centers.
			What are the symptoms?
			Victims suffer from paranoid
			delusions... multi-infarct
			dementia... hallucinations...
			Hallucinations? What kind of
			hallucinations?
			Victims experience somatic,
			tactile and visual hallucinations,
			accompanied by psychogenic
			hysteria.
			Peripheral symptoms include
			sleeplessness... accelerated
			heart-rate...
			Diminished eyesight, leading to
			acute myopia... painful spasms
			in the extremities...
			And in most cases, dehydration.
			Computer... what is the treatment
			for Transporter Psychosis?
			There is no known treatment.
			The autopsy showed residual
			ionization in every one of
			Lieutenant Kelly's systems.
			I think that's what caused
			the muscular and systemic
			contractions.
			Where did this ionization come
			from?
			There's evidence of electrical
			burns on the victim's body...
			as if she were exposed to ionized
			gas... or high energy plasma.
			Plasma? There's no way they
			could've been exposed... unless
			it was matter from the streamer...
			Is there any evidence of a hull
			breach... could plasma from the
			streamer have found its way into
			the ship?
			No...
			Data, what's the report on that
			broken sample container?
			The analysis of the fragments is
			not yet complete.
			Captain -- if there's evidence
			of similar ionization in those
			fragments... it could mean they
			tried to beam aboard material from
			the streamer...
			And if the plasma exploded... that
			would explain a few things.
			Let me know when the analysis
			is complete.
			Aye sir.
			From the looks of these fracture
			patterns, I'd say the explosive
			force came from within the
			container.
			The container does show evidence
			of residual ionization.
			I believe your hypothesis was
			correct. It was being used to
			store high energy plasma.
			So they were collecting samples
			from the plasma streamer...
			But they were using the proper
			container. How could it have
			exploded?
			Perhaps we should try to recreate
			their experiment to see what
			happens when matter is beamed
			aboard under similar conditions.
			Good idea. Let's prepare a new
			container.
			Reg, I don't want to take any
			chances -- start setting up a
			level five containment field here
			in Engineering.
			Aye sir...
			Are you having trouble with your
			eyesight, Mister Barclay?
			No... thank you.
			May I have a word with you,
			Geordi? It concerns Lieutenant
			Barclay.
			What is it?
			He appears to be inordinately
			preoccupied with his physiological
			condition. I have seen him check
			his pulse rate, as well as his
			visual acuity several times in
			the last twenty minutes.
			Reg...
			Yessir?
			Are you alright?
			Just fine, sir.
			You look a little pale.
			I do?
			It's been a long couple of days,
			Reg. Why don't you get some rest.
			We've got everything under control
			here.
			I'll do that, sir. Thank you.
			La Forge to Counselor Troi.
			Go ahead, Commander.
			Counselor... do you have a minute?
			Lieutenant Barclay, I've been
			calling you, why haven't you
			responded --
			Reg, what are you doing?
			Walking.
			I can see that. Where are you
			going?
			Nowhere. I just don't get to
			these decks very often.
			There's Stellar Cartography --
			I thought that was on Deck Eleven.
			Mister Barclay...
			I was... I was having trouble
			sleeping. I'm just trying to wear
			myself out. That's a perfectly
			normal thing to be doing, isn't
			it?
			Commander La Forge said you seemed
			very nervous this morning.
			I'm always nervous. Everyone
			knows that.
			He also mentioned that you said
			you saw something in the
			Transporter beam.
			I was wrong. They checked the
			Transporter and there wasn't...
			there was nothing there. I
			imagined the whole thing.
			You don't sound very convinced
			of that...
			Counselor, I appreciate your
			concern... but I'd rather not
			continue this conversation.
			I'm... I'm feeling perfectly fine.
			Mister Barclay, you are exhausted
			and highly agitated.
			And I cannot allow a member of
			this crew to endanger himself and
			others. I think --
			I'm not endangering anyone and
			I wish you would --
			I think it's in your best interest
			to take a leave of absence.
			Reg -- I'm temporarily relieving
			you of duty.
			Fine... fine... do what you have
			to do, Counselor...
			Computer... more birds.
			End stress reduction program.
			Water.
			Specify temperature.
			I don't care -- just give me
			water!
			Calm... stay calm...
			Computer -- let's try music...
			something soothing.
			Barclay to Chief O'Brien.
			O'Brien here.
			I need your help. Would you
			meet me in Transporter Room
			Three... ?
			Sir, begging your pardon -- but
			couldn't this wait til morning?
			No...
			Chief... I've just... I've been
			reviewing the transport logs...
			What are these... energy
			variations that keep appearing?
			There was one when I transported
			to the science ship... see?
			They're just ionic fluctuations,
			sir. A result of our interlock
			with the Yosemite's transporter
			system.
			A fluctuation occurred while I
			was inside the matter stream... ?
			It's nothing to worry about, sir.
			I need you to transport me to the
			science ship... and directly back
			again. And while I'm in the
			beam... can you recreate one of
			those ionic fluctuations... ?
			I guess so... but if you don't
			mind my asking, sir... what for?
			I need to... Commander La Forge
			wants some tricorder readings of
			those fluctuations.
			We can do it from right here.
			No, I... the Transporter sensors
			may not be sensitive enough...
			I'm giving you an order, Mister
			O'Brien.
			Aye sir.
			If you don't mind my making an
			observation...
			You forgot to bring a tricorder.
			Either there's something in
			there... or I'm going crazy.
			I've got to know.
			You can understand that, can't
			you?
			Yes sir, I can.
			Stand by, sir...
			I want you to wake the senior
			staff.
			Then I saw it again -- just twenty
			minutes ago. The same exact thing
			moving around in the Transporter
			beam.
			Let me get this straight -- you
			think it was alive?
			It was dark and distorted... and
			it had what looked like... a
			mouth...
			A mouth?
			I don't see anything wrong with
			his arm.
			Reg -- why did you wait so long
			to tell anybody about your arm?
			Well... I thought I was
			hallucinating. I thought it
			was... that I had... Transporter
			Psychosis...
			But now I know I don't. I know
			what I saw in there... was real.
			I was the only one to experience
			an ionic fluctuation during
			transport... maybe that explains
			why that's why no one else saw
			it.
			We ran a full diagnostic on the
			Transporter system yesterday,
			Captain. It checked out fine.
			Number One?
			We've been conducting intensive
			scans of the entire binary star
			system. No sign of any life
			forms.
			Mister Barclay, I understand
			you've been under a considerable
			amount of strain the past couple
			of days. Isn't it possible you
			simply imagined --
			I know what you're going to say,
			sir. And I realize... I know I've
			been acting strangely. But you've
			got to believe me. I wouldn't
			have called you in here if I
			weren't absolutely certain.
			Commander La Forge, get Chief
			O'Brien -- take the Transporter
			system apart piece by piece if
			you have to.
			Mister Worf -- maintain a level
			three security alert until further
			notice.
			Aye, sir.
			I'll run a micro-cellular scan
			on Mister Barclay's arm. It'll
			take some time -- but if there's
			something wrong, I'll find it.
			Keep me apprised. Dismissed.
			I'm reading minute levels of
			residual ionization in the
			sub-dermal tissue of his left arm.
			The patterns correspond exactly
			to the ones we measured in
			Lieutenant Kelly's body... and
			in the sample container from the
			science ship.
			There's no question -- you've been
			exposed to the same high energy
			plasma they were.
			So... something did happen to me
			in the Transporter beam?
			It's too early to draw
			conclusions... you might've been
			exposed to something on the
			science ship. But you did say
			something touched your left arm
			during transport... and that's
			where the ionization is
			focused...
			Does this ionization pose a threat
			to Mister Barclay?
			It might. I'll need to run a
			base-pair correlation to look for
			signs of DNA break-down.
			Sir... Commander La Forge and I
			were planning to recreate the
			circumstances of the explosion
			on the Yosemite... that might
			give us some answers. Permission
			to continue with the experiment?
			Granted. Tell Chief O'Brien to
			take all primary Transporters
			off-line. I don't want to risk
			any further... contaminations.
			And make sure you take the
			necessary safety precautions.
			Aye sir.
			I want you to wear this
			monitoring-device. It'll signal
			me at the slightest sign of
			increased ionization.
			Yes, Doctor.
			Structural reinforcement is at
			two hundred forty percent.
			Activating containment field...
			That should do it.
			Okay, Reg -- we've locked onto
			the coordinates of the plasma
			streamer. You can beam aboard
			a sample.
			Aye sir.
			Okay... what would they have done
			first?
			A standard analysis begins with
			a resonance frequency scan.
			Sounds like a good place to start.
			Let's do it.
			Initiating resonance sweep.
			Frequency range at --
			Check the containment field.
			Field is at maximum limits, sir.
			But it is holding.
			My VISOR's picking up bio-magnetic
			energy... highly complex
			patterns...
			I think these things are alive.
			Reg...
			Reg?
			Reg!
			Life forms?
			That is correct. They appear to
			be quasi-energy microbes that
			exist within the distortion field
			of the plasma streamer -- which
			made them undetectable to our
			sensors.
			They didn't come out until we
			tried to run the resonance
			frequency scan. Apparently, they
			didn't like it too much. They
			reacted by shattering the sample
			container.
			Which caused a plasma explosion
			similar to the one on the science
			ship...
			Exactly.
			We think one or more of the
			microbes may have gotten into the
			Transporter system -- and are
			still caught inside the buffer.
			It probably explains what you saw
			in there...
			But... what I saw was much larger
			than a microbe...
			Normal spatial relationships, such
			as size, are often distorted
			within the matter stream.
			Some of these microbes are also
			in your body, Reg.
			Inside me?
			They were in Lieutenant Kelly's
			body as well... that's what caused
			the contractions during the
			autopsy.
			Is that what killed him?
			Yes...
			But now that we've identified the
			microbes, we can start trying to
			eliminate them. I'm going to run
			a full spectrum antigen series...
			if that doesn't work, I'll try
			an imaging probe...
			But... isn't there a way to...
			to... to force these things out
			of me?
			The bio-filter should've screened
			them out... but it didn't...
			The microbes exist simultaneously
			as both matter and energy. The
			bio-filters cannot distinguish
			them from the matter stream.
			Right... but -- if we held Barclay
			suspended in mid-transport... at
			the point where matter starts to
			lose molecular cohesion...
			The molecules would begin to emit
			nucleonic particles. We might
			be able to derive a pattern the
			computer could recognize...
			... and reprogram the bio-filters
			to screen out the microbes.
			Reg, I think this'll work.
			Suspend me... I don't like the
			sound of that...
			We'd have to hold you in there
			for a while...
			How long?
			Thirty or forty seconds... it's
			hard to tell. But I think it
			would be safe...
			But... if I'm in the matter stream
			too long...
			Your pattern would degrade to the
			point where your signal would be
			permanently lost.
			Your pattern might degrade to the
			point where your signal would be
			permanently lost.
			This has been the thing I've been
			afraid of all my life... that I'd
			go in and not come back...
			But I guess... if I'm ever going
			to confront my fear, it might
			as well be now...
			After fifteen seconds or so in
			the beam, you may start to feel
			lightheaded. Try to stay calm...
			and it's important you don't
			move around too much.
			Right.
			Initializing the back-up pattern
			buffer. Holding at stand by...
			You ready, Reg?
			Energize.
			Molecular resolution at sixty
			percent... engaging static
			mode... his pattern is locked and
			holding...
			Starting bio-filter scan...
			Signal's holding...
			The imaging scanners still aren't
			isolating the microbes...
			I'll try increasing molecular
			dispersion...
			But -- his signal resolution's
			dropped to fifty-five percent...
			Don't worry -- I can hold him
			together...
			His signal resolution's down to
			fifty percent... we need to bring
			him back...
			I know, I know... just give me
			one more second...
			We need more dispersion...
			increase phase-transition
			frequency...
			Aye, sir...
			The imaging scanners are
			actuating...
			Got it... pattern acquisition...
			Positive.
			Programming bio-filter...
			This won't hurt a bit, Reg...
			I'm reading a ninety-two percent
			increase in mass, sir!
			Something's in the beam with
			him...
			Security to Transporter Room
			Three!
			I'm setting up a force field
			around the chamber...
			Drop the force field.
			There are more of them in the
			beam... you have to grab them
			and hold on...
			Reg, what happened?
			When I saw there was more than
			one of them... I thought... maybe
			the other crew was trying the
			same thing we were...
			We were infected with
			something... Lieutenant Kelly...
			tried to reprogram the
			bio-filter...
			It looks like he increased
			molecular dispersion past the
			integrity point... your patterns
			were lost in the beam.
			The residual energy from the
			plasma streamer... it must've
			amplified the charge in the
			buffer... enough to keep your
			patterns from degrading...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46043.6.
			The reprogrammed bio-filter was
			effective in removing the alien
			microbes from Mister Barclay and
			the four crewmembers. The
			microbes have been returned to
			the plasma streamer.
			Chief...
			Lieutenant -- glad you could make
			it.
			You know, I think this is the
			first time we've ever talked,
			outside the Transporter Room.
			Well... to be honest, I always
			avoided you.
			Why?
			Because... you run the
			Transporters, and I hate
			transporters...
			At least... I used to...
			So what's in the box?
			I thought you might like to meet
			Christina.
			Christina -- Lieutenant Barclay.
			Your... pet spider.
			Lycosa tarantula. Don't worry,
			she won't bite.
			It's... she's... very... large.
			I found her on Titus Four...
			almost stepped on her by accident.
			I'll get us a couple of drinks.
			Keep an eye on her, will you?
			Sure...
			Um... Chief...
