			Captain's Log, Stardate 46271.5.
			The Enterprise has entered orbit
			of Deinonychus Seven. But our
			scheduled rendezvous with the
			supply ship Biko has been delayed
			for another forty-eight hours.
			In the meantime, many members of
			the crew are taking advantage of
			the delay to pursue their own
			projects... myself included.
			Computer -- stop playback.
			Change the clarinet to an oboe.
			Continue recording.
			Pause program.
			Come.
			Captain -- we'd like permission
			to take the Engineering computer
			off-line for a couple of hours.
			We've been working on a new
			interface that'll allow Data to
			act as an emergency back-up in
			case of a ship-wide systems
			failure.
			In theory, my neural network
			should be able to sustain key
			systems until primary control is
			restored.
			It sounds like an intriguing
			experiment. I'll be very
			interested to see the results.
			Permission granted.
			It's possible we may even be able
			to run secondary systems through
			Data. Weapons control... sensor
			arrays...
			Yes. I get the idea, Mister La
			Forge. Thank you. Please
			proceed.
			Computer -- record again from the
			first measure.
			Computer -- pause program.
			Come.
			Jean-Luc, I need to talk with you
			about "Something for Breakfast."
			The play.
			Ah... yes... a very intriguing
			drama. But I really don't have
			the time it would take to learn
			a part. And anyway, I'm not much
			of an actor...
			That's no problem. You wouldn't
			be playing one of the leads.
			Oh.
			It's a very small part. Only two
			lines in the whole play.
			Really.
			You play the butler.
			Let me read the play again...
			and I'll let you know.
			You'll be wonderful, Jean-Luc.
			Rehearsal's at one thirty this
			afternoon.
			Computer -- continue recording.
			Enter.
			Captain, I am sorry to interrupt,
			but I wanted to consult you
			regarding the duty roster.
			Proceed.
			I was hoping we could take
			advantage of the Biko's delay by
			staging shipwide security drills.
			I have planned a tentative
			schedule...
			Very impressive, Mister Worf.
			But we'll be taking on new
			personnel at Starbase One-Eighteen
			in a few weeks. Surely the drills
			can wait until then.
			In that case, I will use the time
			to perform maintenance checks on
			the forward phaser array.
			Mister Worf... is there some
			reason you're trying to give
			yourself more work?
			No sir. I simply wished to use
			the extra time to...
			... Enjoy yourself. You have some
			free time. Use it.
			Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
			Computer, once more from the top.
			What did he say?
			The Captain saw fit to release
			me from my duties.
			You mean, you can go?
			I can go.
			Saddle up, Father!
			Where are we?
			Deadwood, South Dakota...
			nineteenth century Earth.
			The Ancient West.
			What is our function here?
			You're the Sheriff... and I'm your
			deputy.
			We are in charge of law
			enforcement?
			Right.
			You wrote this Holodeck program
			yourself?
			Well... Mister Barclay helped a
			little.
			I must talk with Mister Barclay...
			Geordi... I have noticed that you
			have not shaved in several days.
			Are you attempting to grow another
			beard?
			As a matter of fact, I am...
			What do you think?
			As is the case with many natural
			growth processes, it is difficult
			to envision the end product based
			on an intermediate stage.
			You're right -- give it a few more
			days.
			Okay... I'll need to access your
			auxiliary inputs...
			One moment.
			I have to admit, Data... I never
			get used to seeing you like
			this...
			I do not understand. You are
			constantly working on similar
			electronic systems, yet their
			appearances do not disturb you.
			Yeah, well... you're not just
			another electronic system.
			Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you
			just another biological organism.
			That should do it. Are you ready?
			Yes.
			I am establishing computer
			link-up...
			Interface complete.
			Alright... let's see what you can
			do...
			If I ever find the varmint who
			drew this... he'll be sorry he
			ever put pen to paper.
			I'm ten times uglier than that,
			ain't I?
			Shut up.
			You laugh so much, it's a wonder
			flies don't live in your mouth...
			You are a very funny man, Senor
			Eli...
			That's the bad guy. His name's
			Eli Hollander -- they call him
			"The Butcher of Bozeman." He's
			killed twenty-three men.
			He's the meanest, toughest
			gunslinger in the West. You have
			to watch him... He's fast...
			So I am here to apprehend him?
			If you can.
			You are under arrest.
			Is that so --
			You will come with me.
			No, no, no...
			Computer -- freeze program.
			What is wrong?
			That was too easy. It's gotta
			be harder to beat the bad guys.
			Otherwise, it's no fun.
			Oh.
			Computer -- increase program
			difficulty to Level Four. Go back
			to where my father and I first
			walked into the saloon.
			Come on, Father...
			If I ever find the varmint who
			drew this... he'll be sorry he
			ever put pen to paper.
			I'm ten times uglier than that,
			ain't I?
			Shut up.
			You laugh so much, it's a wonder
			flies don't take up residence in
			your mouth...
			You are a very funny man, Senor
			Eli...
			Where are they going?
			They don't want to get hit by the
			bullets.
			You are under arrest --
			He's getting ready to draw.
			Well... looks like Sheriff Worf
			is here to arrest me. Don't sound
			like a very bright idea... does
			it?
			You have been accused of
			committing a homicide.
			If you mean murder, then I guess
			I'm guilty.
			I've killed twenty-three men,
			Sheriff... one more ain't gonna
			make that much of a difference.
			'Course... shootin someone as ugly
			as you... could hardly be
			considered a crime.
			Were you just born that way...
			or did your momma marry an
			armadillo?
			I am beginning to see the appeal
			of this program...
			Sheriff, look out!
			Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff...
			'Less you want a shave.
			Okay, boys... time to saddle up.
			But first... get their money and
			jewelry.
			You are a murderer... and a thief.
			A man's gotta make a livin.
			I suggest you find a new line of
			work.
			I asked Counselor Troi to join
			us. She loves Western stories.
			You'll regret this, stranger.
			I am now attempting to access the
			long range sensor array...
			Forward sensor array coming
			online... we're getting a clear
			scan...
			I will perform a routine
			maintenance check on the starboard
			inertial damping system...
			Dampers on-line... maintanence
			check in progress... Data, I think
			we're on to something here...
			Let's see what you can do with
			secondary systems. Try
			gravitational control...
			Initiating gravitational --
			Data, what's wrong?
			There appears to be an energy
			fluctuation in my neural net.
			I am disconnecting my interface
			to the computer.
			Interface deactivated.
			You alright?
			I have experienced a brief power
			surge in my positronic
			subprocessor.
			But I am fine.
			Maybe the interface coding is less
			stable than we thought...
			Looks like we've got a few hours
			of systems analysis before we can
			try this again.
			Let's check the interface
			programming...
			What are his rights in this
			century? Will there be a trial...
			or shall I execute him?
			We're supposed to hold him until
			the U.S. Marshal comes. Then
			he'll take him to Rapid City for
			a trial.
			Frankly, I don't think I'll be
			around that long. Not after my
			old man hears about this.
			To what "old man" do you refer?
			My pa. When he comes to break
			me outta this tin can... the
			gravedigger'll be working
			overtime...
			Your pa's no match for Sheriff
			Worf.
			If your father comes, we will be
			ready for him.
			He's right.
			You're no match for the
			Hollanders.
			I am sure the three of us can
			handle any problems.
			Hold on. I was just passing
			through town... saw a little
			trouble... thought I'd lend a
			hand...
			But I'm not one of your deputies,
			Sheriff.
			Counselor... I would appreciate
			your support in this matter.
			Durango...
			I'm called Durango.
			Oh... well... Counselor Durango...
			perhaps you would consider
			becoming a temporary deputy?
			For a price....
			Five hundred dollars.
			Alexander -- we require large
			amounts of currency.
			Yes sir. I'll go to the bank and
			make a withdrawal.
			Deanna... how do you know so much
			about this period in Earth's
			history?
			My father used to read me stories
			about the Ancient West when I was
			a little girl.
			I must admit... I've always wanted
			to play the part of the
			"Mysterious Stranger."
			You are just so brave... facing
			down that evil man like you did.
			Thank you. Ms... ?
			Annie, you big galoot.
			You best not forget that
			tonight...
			I'm gonna cook you up a beef
			steak... and gooseberry cobbler
			for dessert.
			Sounds delicious.
			I bought special candles for the
			table setting... pure beeswax.
			I will not have time this evening.
			I have a prisoner.
			I'll watch him for you, Sheriff.
			You two go have a good time.
			That is very considerate of you.
			But I would be negligent in my
			duties if I did not stay.
			I am sorry... Ms. Annie.
			It's another woman, ain't it?
			That floosie down at Miss
			Langford's House of Pleasure...
			Who... where?
			You sure got a way with women,
			Sheriff.
			Computer -- activate Picard
			Mozart trio, Program One.
			Play back tracks one, two and
			three. Tempo allegro.
			Computer -- stop playback!
			Computer -- identify musical
			composition.
			Picard Mozart trio, Program
			One.
			Let's read through Act Two. From
			the beginning...
			"Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature
			An endothermic quadraped, carnivorous... "
			Hold it... Wil, what are you
			reading?
			My lines. Why?
			That's not the right dialogue...
			Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses
			Contribute to your hunting skill and... "
			Wait a second... I recognize
			this... It's Data's poetry.
			The play's gone. I just keep
			getting more poetry...
			Well.. the PADDs are functioning
			normally...
			It seems to be a problem with the
			information retrieval net. For
			some reason, when you tried to
			bring up your play, the computer
			accessed Data's literary files.
			Geordi, perhaps this problem is
			related to our interface
			experiment.
			We'd better run a Level Two
			diagnostic on the computer. See
			if the problem has spread to any
			other systems...
			And I will perform a
			self-diagnostic.
			Good idea.
			You'll let me know if you find
			the play?
			Yeah... Don't worry, it's in here
			somewhere.
			We got him...
			Where's my boy?
			I'm not supposed to be kidnapped
			now...
			Computer -- freeze program!
			Hey!
			Computer -- freeze program!
			You want us to kill him, Senor
			Frank?
			No...
			He's more valuable to us alive.
			Feline supplement, one hundred
			twenty-seven.
			Spot, I have formulated a new
			mixture of foods specifically
			tailored to your highly selective
			tastes.
			Puzzling. I find it extremely
			difficult to predict what you will
			find acceptable.
			Perhaps hunger will compel you
			to try it again.
			Spot, you are disrupting my
			ability to work.
			You lil' varmint.
			The most important thing about
			the quick draw is, you've got to
			hold your arm loose... like
			this...
			Now... you try it.
			Hell to blazes... I better warn
			my pa. We got a regular sharp
			shooter here!
			Silence.
			Worf... Alexander has been gone
			for over half an hour. Shouldn't
			he be back by now?
			Yes... I will go find him.
			Watch the prisoner.
			So, Mister Hollander... I
			understand you've lived a life
			of violent crime.
			Would you like to discuss your
			feelings about it?
			What'll it be?
			I am looking for my deputy.
			Perhaps you have seen him.
			Nope.
			What'll you have?
			Klingon Firewine.
			This ain't Kansas City. We don't
			got none of that fancy European
			stuff here.
			Maybe I should bring you a sherry.
			That is what they serve over at
			Miss Langford's, ain't it?
			Howdy, Sheriff.
			Commander ... what are you doing
			here?
			The name is Frank Hollander.
			Oh... I see...
			What are you smiling at?
			Nothing. Nothing at all...
			"Mister Hollander."
			What is it you want?
			My boy.
			That is not possible. Your son
			is to stand trial for murder.
			Well then... maybe we can work
			it out. Is there something
			you want... in exchange for
			my boy?
			You have nothing I want.
			What about... your deputy?
			What about him?
			Where is he?
			I do not negotiate with criminals.
			Your son will stand trial.
			Not so fast...
			Commander... what are you doing?
			I ain't in the mood for games,
			Sheriff.
			Data... ?
			Computer -- freeze program.
			Your move, Sheriff.
			I wouldn't walk out that door,
			Sheriff...
			Worf, what's going on?
			The Holodeck safeguards are not
			functioning. Alexander is in
			danger.
			My God -- you've been shot.
			Computer -- end program.
			Troi to Captain Picard.
			Troi to Security.
			There is a new character in the
			program -- Hollander's father.
			He looks like Commander Data...
			Data?
			But it is not Data... I cannot
			explain.
			I believe he has taken Alexander.
			Now ain't that a shame... the poor
			Sheriff's been injured...
			What's wrong... was my pa a little
			too rough on you?
			Data... ?
			What?
			Why would the computer create
			Holodeck characters that look like
			Data?
			Where have they taken my son?
			Where is he?
			Temper, temper, Sheriff. Pa
			wouldn't be too pleased if I came
			back all bruised...
			Worf, wait...
			We've got to remember... the
			Holodeck safeguards may be off,
			but this is still a program...
			If we can get to the end of this
			story... the way it was designed
			to play out... the program should
			automatically terminate.
			You are right...
			I will begin by speaking to the
			people of this town. Perhaps
			someone witnessed Alexander's
			abduction.
			We think our interface experiment
			may have caused one of the
			computer's core subroutines to
			be altered.
			When the interface malfunction
			occurred, subroutine C-forty-seven
			was replaced by elements of my
			personal programming.
			What does C-forty-seven control?
			Library computer access...
			replicator selection...
			recreational programming... No
			critical systems.
			That would explain why your music
			composition program began playing
			"The Slavonic Dances." I have
			been analyzing the collected works
			of Anton Dvorak.
			The same with Doctor Crusher's
			play... and with the food
			replicators...
			The replicators on Decks Four
			through Nine have started
			producing nothing but cat food.
			Cat food?
			I have been formulating
			nutritional supplements for Spot.
			When can you have the problem
			corrected?
			We are currently attempting to
			isolate the corrupted circuit
			pathways.
			I reckon the process should take
			less then two hours.
			What did you say?
			I said the process would take less
			than two hours.
			No -- you said "I reckon... "
			According to my memory log, I did
			not use those words.
			Ya'll must be mistaken.
			There, Data, You did it again.
			Did whut?
			Mister La Forge -- perhaps you
			should take Mister Data to
			Engineering. See if you can find
			the problem.
			Aye sir.
			Can I help you with somethin?
			I spoke to several witnesses.
			One saw Alexander being abducted
			as he was leaving the bank... by
			Hollander's men.
			We will begin a systematic search
			of the town...
			Worf... we've got another
			problem. I saw Eli shuffling his
			cards. He was doing it the way
			Data does when he plays poker...
			He doesn't just look like Data...
			he has Data's abilities. And
			his father probably does, as
			well...
			Howdy, Sheriff.
			I came to see my boy.
			Remove your weapon.
			Take a good look at that gun,
			Sheriff... you might see it again
			real soon.
			Eli?
			Pa!
			How have they been treating you,
			son?
			Real bad, Pa. They ain't fed me
			since I got here... and the
			Sheriff's been roughin me up
			somethin fierce.
			Don't you worry. The Sheriff will
			pay for this.
			Who's the stranger?
			Don't know... she ain't said her
			name. But she's in cahoots with
			the Sheriff... and she's mighty
			mean with a Winchester.
			Sit tight, boy. I'll have you
			home in time for supper.
			I'll give you one more opportunity
			to avoid an ugly situation,
			Sheriff. Release my boy.
			I have... reconsidered your offer.
			I will release your son... in
			exchange for my deputy.
			I thought you might have a change
			of heart...
			Meet me in two hours. You be
			in front of the saloon... I'll
			be in front of the livery station.
			Agreed.
			Strangers ain't invited.
			In every Western I've ever read,
			the villains break their word.
			We can't trust him.
			But we have made an honorable
			agreement.
			They're not concerned with honor,
			Worf. This is the Ancient West.
			There's a gunfighter out there
			who can shoot with the speed and
			accuracy of an android...
			And in two hours, he's going to
			try to kill you.
			Howdy, Commander.
			Mister La Forge... what have you
			found?
			Well... we figure parts of my
			memory structure...
			... have been replaced with
			information from the computer's
			recreational data-base.
			Specifically, files relating to
			the nineteenth century American
			West.
			That explains the accent...
			That's right, partner.
			Is this another result of the
			interface experiment?
			I'm afraid so. But we've
			initiated a progressive memory
			purge to restore Data's programming
			to its original state.
			He should be back to normal in
			a few hours.
			What about the computer's
			recreational data-base?
			We've started a memory purge
			there, as well. It'll take
			another hour... maybe two.
			You just sit tight, Commander.
			We'll have it fixed up in time
			for supper.
			Good.
			I will be positioned here, at the
			Eastern end of the street...
			Frank Hollander says he will
			approach from this end...
			Once he gets to this point, he
			will be within range.
			Understood.
			What about Alexander?
			There is a rain barrel in front
			of the saloon. It should be
			enough to stop the bullets.
			You wouldn't believe what I went
			through to talk Old Man Newsome
			out of his telegraph machine...
			Excellent.
			Lord knows why I keep riskin my
			life for you, Sheriff...
			Thank you, Ms. Annie. I am...
			in your debt.
			How long will the field last?
			It is highly unstable. No more
			than fifteen seconds.
			Let's hope that's enough.
			Eli -- down!
			Alexander!
			Senor Frank!
			Don't even think about it.
			Go ahead and shoot me.
			Do not show your face in this
			town again.
			Father!
			Are you alright?
			Yes.
			Computer -- end program.
			I don't understand this. The
			story should be over... what's
			left?
			Sheriff... Sheriff!
			You're as handy with a
			shootin'-iron as you are with a
			lady's heart!
			Computer -- end program!
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46278.3.
			Both Commander Data and the ship's
			computer have been restored to
			normal operation. Our rendezvous
			with the supply ship Biko has
			proceeded as planned.
			Father...
			After what happened... I guess
			you'll never want to go back to
			the Ancient West...
			The town of Deadwood may face
			danger again, Alexander. If they
			do... they'll need a Sheriff...
			and a deputy.
