			Captain's log, Stardate 46682.4.
			The Enterprise is docked at the
			Remmler Array, where it will
			undergo a routine procedure to
			eliminate accumulated baryon
			particles. In preparation for the
			sweep, we are evacuating the ship.
			Captain... we're still behind
			schedule on decks seven and eight.
			Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll
			be a delay?
			No. Open up the Transporters in
			Cargo Bay Two and divert everyone
			from deck seven there. That
			should get us back on track.
			Right.
			Captain... Arkaria Base does not
			have the medical storage units I
			requested. I have seven living
			tissue samples that won't survive
			the baryon sweep anymore than you
			or I would. I've tried to reason
			with them, but --
			Have Mister LaForge transport a
			stasis unit from the astrophysics
			lab. You should be able to
			convert it to store tissue
			samples.
			Thank you.
			Captain... I was just heading for
			deck seven. I've put the auto-shutdown
			sequence on hold until we
			get back on schedule.
			I think we can resume the
			sequence. Counselor Troi is
			taking care of the situation on
			deck seven.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain.
			Mister Data.
			Bridge.
			It has been quite a day, has it
			not?
			Yes it has.
			However, a change of routine is
			often invigorating and can be a
			welcome diversion after a long
			assignment.
			Exactly.
			I understand that Arkaria has some
			very interesting weather patterns.
			Data -- are you alright?
			Yes, sir. I was attempting to
			fill a silent moment with non-relevant
			conversation.
			Small talk?
			Yes, sir. I have found that
			humans often make "small talk"
			during awkward moments.
			Therefore, I have written a new
			subroutine designed for that
			purpose. How did I do?
			Perhaps it was a little too... non-relevant.
			However, if you're
			interested in small talk keep your
			eye on Commander Hutchinson during
			the reception this afternoon...
			... he's a master.
			Thank you sir, I will.
			After you...
			No sir. I believe you spoke
			first.
			We're running out of time,
			gentlemen. Mister Worf?
			The computer needs your
			authorization to disable command
			functions during the baryon sweep.
			Are we ready, Mister La Forge?
			Almost. I've requested some
			additional field diverters for the
			computer core and the Bridge and
			they haven't been installed yet.
			Additional units?
			We've logged more warp hours in
			five years than most ships do in
			ten, so our baryon particle levels
			are pretty high. I'm a little
			worried that when the Remmler
			Array starts sweeping the ship it
			might have to use a stronger beam
			than normal to clear out all the
			radiation.
			And that might overload the field
			diverters protecting our key
			systems. How long until the new
			ones are in place?
			I'd say another twenty minutes.
			Very well.
			Computer, disable all command
			functions in thirty minutes.
			Authorization: Picard gamma-six-zero-seven-three.
			Authorization acknowledged.
			Incoming message, Captain. It's
			the station administrator, Mister
			Orton.
			In my Ready Room.
			Sir. Request permission to be
			excused from Commander
			Hutchinson's... reception.
			Permission granted. I only wish
			I could excuse myself as well.
			Captain, permission to --
			Sorry, Mister LaForge... I can't
			excuse the entire senior staff.
			Worf beat you to it.
			Go ahead, Mister Orton.
			Captain, if you're on schedule,
			I'd like to confirm that we'll
			begin the baryon sweep at fifteen
			hundred hours -- approximately one
			hour from now.
			Confirmed.
			Commander Hutchinson also wanted
			me to make sure that you'll be
			able to attend his reception this
			afternoon.
			Tell him... I'm looking forward to
			it.
			He'll be delighted to hear that.
			Arkaria Base out.
			Tell Arkaria base that we're
			almost finished here...
			We're going to need two more
			conduits...
			I need to run a diagnostic on the
			diverter...
			Get the diverter aligned so that
			we can begin the isolation
			procedure.
			Where's the ODN interface?
			Beverly!
			Lovely as ever... how do you
			manage it?
			It's good to see you again.
			It's been far too long -- what is
			it, four years? Now I want to
			hear all about what happened after
			you left Starfleet Medical. And
			I have so much to tell you.
			Oh, that must be Commander Riker.
			Excuse me, won't you?
			Of course.
			You must be Wil Riker.
			I guess I must.
			Calvin Hutchinson -- call me
			Hutch. Calvin -- awful name, I've
			never forgiven my parents. As
			soon as I saw you, I knew you had
			to be the Enterprise's first
			officer.
			Oh?
			Of course. Your reputation
			proceeds you -- flashing blue
			eyes, square jaw... quite the
			ladies man I hear. Now don't be
			modest, Wil -- may I call you Wil?
			Uh, sure.
			I've also heard that you're a
			musician. I hope you'll play
			something for us. It's not often
			that I get a chance to entertain
			the command crew of the
			flagship... and speaking of
			command, hello Captain Picard.
			Commander.
			I was just telling your first
			officer what a real pleasure it is
			to have you all...
			It is very good to see you both
			again. May I call you Beverly? --
			Beverly, do you find the mean
			temperature here on Arkaria to be
			slightly above normal for human
			comfort levels?
			I have found that most humans
			prefer a temperature of twenty-one
			degrees C in order to operate most
			efficiently. However, there are
			some cultures which actually...
			... I tell you, you've never seen
			anything like it. There were
			thousands of these creatures...
			the whole northern sky turned
			dark.
			Geordi! Deanna! I don't believe
			you've met our host.
			Allow me to introduce Commander
			Geordi La Forge, Counselor Deanna
			Troi. This is Commander
			Hutchinson.
			Hutch.
			Hello.
			Hello.
			I was just telling your captain
			about some of the fascinating
			sights here on Arkaria. Is either
			of you interested in ornithology?
			Uh... well...
			The mating habits of the Arkarian
			horn fowl are quite interesting.
			If the weather were better, we
			could take horses to the southern
			promontory and visit the nesting
			grounds.
			Horses?
			Yes... there's a network of trails
			through the plains.
			Unfortunately, they aren't very
			pleasant right now... muddy, cold.
			Not a soul for kilometers.
			That sounds... perfect.
			How long until the baryon sweep
			begins on the Enterprise?
			At least twenty-five minutes.
			Then I'll have time to get my
			saddle.
			Your... saddle?
			Yes.
			A saddle is a very personal thing.
			It has to be broken in... worn...
			cared for...
			You keep a saddle... on the
			Enterprise?
			Yes.
			I've had it since the Academy.
			I never know when I'll have the
			opportunity to ride.
			I see.
			It's perfectly normal. Most
			serious riders have their own
			saddles.
			Of course.
			Yes, sir.
			Absolutely.
			If you'll excuse me.
			An amazing man. He reminds me of
			another officer I knew many years
			ago... a Captain Edwell. Now he
			was fascinating... born on Gaspra
			Seven but you wouldn't know it
			from the way he looked...
			Auto-shutdown sequence in
			progress. Defensive systems off-line.
			Baryon sweep begins in
			eight minutes.
			What are you doing?
			Somone left this ODN junction box
			open.
			I thought your crew was supposed
			to leave the ship once the field
			diverters were in place.
			The diverters have to be
			synchronized.
			I was laser-bonding a backup link.
			I see. Well, I suppose I'd better
			let you finish up so you can get
			off the ship.
			Wait a minute --
			Auto shut-down sequence in
			progress. Inertial dampers off-line.
			Baryon sweep begins in six
			minutes.
			Auto shut-down sequence in
			progress. Life support off-line.
			Baryon sweep begins in three
			minutes.
			We still have to by-pass the
			magnetic containment conduit.
			That should be down on deck
			thirty.
			Get Pomet started on it right
			away.
			Auto shut-down sequence in
			progress. Primary power off-line
			in one minute.
			Primary power off-line in thirty
			seconds.
			Final warning. Primary power off-line
			in ten seconds...
			I find it fascinating that your
			family chose to drop the prefix
			"Pel" from your surname. It was
			my understanding that "Pel Orton"
			would be considered a more noble
			appellation on Arkaria than simply
			Orton.
			Yes.
			Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend
			toward a more egalitarian society
			is partly responsible.
			Perhaps.
			The crew of the Magellan actually
			put on a talent show here.
			Captain Conklin did a poetry
			reading, if you can imagine that.
			I'm trying to.
			Did I ever tell you how I came to
			be stationed here? It's a
			fascinating story.
			You see, I was serving on Admiral
			Mitchell's staff on Starbase
			ninety-seven -- awful place, by
			the way --
			Hutch. Have you met our Commander
			Data?
			Why no, I don't think so.
			... there are several cultures in
			this sector with remarkably
			similar etymological histories --
			Data, allow me to introduce our
			host. This is Commander
			Hutchinson -- call him Hutch.
			This is our second officer,
			Commander Data.
			A pleasure.
			The pleasure is mine. I have been
			meaning to compliment you on your
			choice of colors here.
			You really think so? It wasn't
			easy to make the final decision,
			let me tell you.
			I am sure of that. The light in
			this room makes color selection
			exceptionally problematic.
			Precisely.
			Thank you.
			You're welcome.
			I'm not sure which one to feel
			sorry for.
			Mister Orton?
			If you'll excuse me, Commander.
			Geordi... what happened to the
			Captain?
			He went back to the ship to get
			his saddle.
			His saddle?
			Any serious rider would have his
			own saddle.
			Oh.
			He probably went right to the
			stables. I bet he's ten
			kilometers from here already.
			Lucky him.
			Kelsey to Devor.
			Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply.
			Devor, do you read me?
			Kelsey to Kiros.
			This is Kiros.
			Devor isn't responding. There
			must be too much interference from
			the baryon sweep. Go find him and
			see if he finished by-passing the
			regulator on deck seven, then meet
			us in Main Engineering.
			Understood.
			Who are you? What are you doing
			on my ship.
			The baryon sweep uses a high-frequency
			plasma field. That
			phaser won't work.
			You're probably right.
			But I'm willing to bet that this
			will.
			What's going on in Main
			Engineering?
			I suggest you cooperate.
			You're Starfleet... you won't kill
			me.
			Are you sure?
			I guess you're right.
			... yes, but Tyrellian laser-art
			is very similar in form and
			composition.
			Oh, of course. Funny you should
			mention that. I used to be
			stationed on Tyrellia.
			Really? There are five Tyrellians
			currently serving aboard the
			Enterprise.
			Fascinating. Not many people know
			this, but Tyrellia is one of only
			three known inhabited worlds
			without a magnetic pole.
			I was aware of that. Are you
			aware that Tyrellia is also one of
			seven known planets...
			Are they still at it?
			Non-stop. I have to admit it has
			a sort of strange fascination...
			I mean, how long can two people
			talk about... nothing?
			Is something wrong?
			Uh... I don't know. I'm getting
			a weird energy reading from your
			table.
			I'm sure it's nothing serious.
			Perhaps the heating element under
			the tray is malfunctioning.
			Maybe I should take a look at it.
			I'm sure we can handle this,
			whatever it is, Commander.
			There's no need to concern
			yourself.
			I really think I should look at
			that heating element. If it
			overloads under --
			It's all right.
			What's that all about?
			We'll look into it. You don't
			have to concern yourself.
			Orton, now!
			Stay right where you are.
			Reduce the plasma pressure to zero
			point six percent nominal.
			Zero point six.
			How does the conduit look?
			It's clear.
			All right. The main plasma flow
			is shunted to the aft conduit.
			We're ready up here.
			Okay.
			That should do it. I think.
			Be sure, Neil.
			Uh... yes... yes, that does it.
			All right... transfer five hundred
			milligrams from the reserve system
			to the engine core.
			Perfect.
			Adequate. Disable the containment
			overrides and get the interlocks
			off the magnetic seal.
			Right.
			Pomet, prepare the transport
			assembly.
			Keep watching the power flow, it
			might...
			Keep working.
			Where did he come from?
			I found him on deck seven.
			Who are you?
			My name is Mott. I'm... the
			barber.
			The barber? What the hell are you
			doing here? Everyone was supposed
			to be evacuated to the surface.
			I... I know. But, I wanted to go
			riding and I didn't have my
			saddle, so I came back --
			Your saddle?
			That's right. I left it in the
			corridor on deck seven. When the
			power went off, I got lost and
			didn't know where to go so --
			All right, shut up.
			Any sign of Devor?
			No.
			If he's off looting at a time like
			this...
			All right, go find him and make
			sure nothing's wrong.
			Salter. Get over here and keep an
			eye on our... barber.
			Sit down.
			Sure, okay. You don't need to
			point that at me.
			Just do what I tell you, and you
			won't have to worry.
			How long until you're ready?
			Forty, maybe fifty minutes.
			The baryon sweep hits this
			compartment in thirty minutes.
			The field diverter will protect
			us.
			It's not us I'm worried about,
			it's that storage unit. I want
			the trilithium resin...
			... in there and secured before the
			sweep gets here. I don't want to
			take any chances.
			Understood.
			They haven't tried to communicate
			with the outside.
			No demands, no political
			statements, no theft... they must
			want something.
			Orton is not as calm as he looks.
			He's very agitated and nervous...
			as if something's gone wrong.
			It is possible that Geordi upset
			their timetable when he saw the
			hidden weapons.
			Orton could be improvising...
			maybe he didn't plan to take us
			hostage this early... so now he
			doesn't know what to do...
			If they do not have a plan for
			this contingency, we may have the
			initiative.
			Maybe, but we have to think of a
			way to use it...
			How's Geordi?
			There's no permanent damage. I've
			adjusted the optical transducer in
			his VISOR to block some of the
			pain receptors in his brain, but
			it's only partially effective.
			What about Hutchinson?
			There was nothing I could do for
			him.
			I still need to get Geordi to a
			medical facility.
			I doubt he'll agree to that.
			If we told him Geordi was dying he
			might give us access to a medical
			kit... maybe we could make a
			weapon from some of the tools...
			Perhaps we can use the VISOR as a
			weapon. If the optical transducer
			were modified, it may be possible
			to generate a hypersonic pulse.
			A hypersonic pulse would overload
			the audio receptors of everyone in
			the room. It would cause
			immediate unconsciousness.
			Can you make the adjustments to
			the VISOR by yourself? It's going
			to look suspicious if both of you
			go over there.
			I'll try... Geordi may have to
			help me through some of it.
			All right... try to keep it
			casual. Let us know when you're
			ready.
			Ready.
			Begin draining the trilithium at
			one hundred milligrams per minute.
			Neil, what's going on!?
			The primary inducer is completely
			fused. There's no way to fix it.
			Without the diverter, we don't
			have any protection from the
			baryon sweep.
			I know that. How long until the
			baryon sweep hits this section?
			About twelve minutes. We should
			go to Ten Forward, it's the last
			place on the ship that'll be swept
			by the baryon field.
			All right, we're leaving. But
			we're taking the trilithium with
			us.
			What? The storage unit wasn't
			designed to be portable. We can't
			just start hauling it through the
			ship --
			I'll... I'll try to make some
			modifications.
			Satler's dead... he ran into the
			baryon sweep.
			And what about Mott?
			I don't know. But I don't think
			he's a barber. I found this in
			the Jefferies Tube.
			Kelsey to Kiros.
			This is Kiros.
			We have a problem. There's a
			Starfleet officer still aboard.
			He killed Satler and he may have
			killed Devor.
			He also destroyed the diverter in
			Engineering so we have to leave
			here before the baryon sweep
			enters this section.
			What about the trilithium resin?
			We're taking it with us to Ten
			Forward.
			There should be enough time before --
			Kelsey. Don't be a fool. You
			know better than to try moving
			that resin.
			Mister Mott... or should I call
			you Lieutenant... Lieutenant
			Commander perhaps?
			You may call me whatever you wish,
			but moving trilithium resin
			requires very specific equipment.
			You can't simply improvise
			something.
			I wouldn't need to improvise if
			you hadn't damaged our field
			diverter.
			But if you're so concerned about
			the trilithium, I suggest you stop
			interfering with us -- before you
			set off an explosion that would
			destroy the Enterprise... and you.
			I would rather destroy this ship
			than allow that material to fall
			into the hands of terrorists.
			What makes you think I'm a
			terrorist?
			Trilithium resin is a highly toxic
			waste material produced by our
			engines. There's no possible use
			for it except as a weapon.
			You might be right, Mister Mott.
			But we've been planning this for
			a long time, and I doubt that
			you'll really be able to stop
			us... or even slow us down.
			That's it... three hundred
			milligrams of trilithium.
			I'm using a dynamic stabilizer to
			act as a control rod...
			There. That should keep the resin
			stable enough for transport.
			Don't look so tense, Neil. If
			something goes wrong, you won't
			have time to worry about it.
			Let's go.
			How much further?
			Three more decks... then we take
			corridor fifteen-B all the way to
			Ten Forward.
			What's wrong?
			We have to find another way up.
			That wasn't very clever, Mister
			Mott.
			If you knew where we were, you
			should've attacked us. Now we'll
			just take another route... one you
			might not be able to predict.
			There are only so many ways to Ten
			Forward... and Ten Forward is the
			only logical place to go if you
			want to stay ahead of the Baryon
			sweep.
			That sweep is just as big a threat
			to you as it is to us. In fact,
			if I were you, Mister Mott, I'd be
			trying to find a way off this
			ship.
			I plan on leaving the same way you
			do... on your ship.
			What ship?
			Come on, Kelsey. If you've been
			planning this for so long, you
			must have a way to get off the
			Enterprise and leave this system.
			I think there's a ship coming for
			you. And I plan to be on it.
			It's a small ship, Mott... I don't
			think there's going to be room for
			both of us.
			I'm sorry to hear that... I'll
			send your regrets.
			How is he, Doctor?
			He's in a lot of pain, but he
			should be fine. He needs some
			water.
			We're almost ready. But when we
			set the VISOR to emit the
			hypersonic pulse, there'll be a
			short burst of light. We need a
			distraction.
			They need a distraction.
			How long?
			A few seconds.
			I think I can keep Orton busy for
			a few seconds.
			I don't think Orton's in a talking
			mood, Wil.
			You just have to know how to talk
			to him.
			Orton, I think we should discuss
			this situation.
			There's nothing to discuss. Sit
			down.
			I think there's a lot to discuss.
			Can't we be reasonable here?
			I'm not interested in hearing your
			hostage negotiation tactics,
			Commander.
			It won't hurt you to listen, will
			it?
			All right.
			Thank you. Now the first thing I
			think we should discuss is this...
			Well, Commander... Here's my
			response.
			Put your weapon down... slowly.
			Kelsey, this is Kiros. I'm on
			deck ten. I have Mott.
			Is he alive?
			Yes.
			Good. Meet us at intersection
			forty-one.
			Understood.
			Move.
			Give me the trilithium.
			How... how much farther do we have
			to go?
			Not far.
			With all the modifications you
			made to this unit, will we have
			any trouble removing the
			trilithium?
			No... you just remove the control
			rod and then drain the unit...
			there shouldn't be any problem.
			That's all I wanted to know.
			Well... not as clever as you
			thought. Where's Pomet?
			He shot him with some kind of
			arrow.
			He's not dead.
			Well, he will be soon. The baryon
			sweep's nearly here and we don't
			have time to go back for him.
			What about Neil?
			The sweep got him. Let's go.
			And you can lead, Mister Mott.
			That way if we come to any more of
			your little surprises, you'll be
			sure to let us know.
			I thought you were going to talk
			with him.
			I did. He just didn't like what
			I had to say.
			That was a perimeter warning from
			the Remmler Array. A small ship
			is approaching.
			I believe Mister Orton has just
			dropped the defense shields.
			This has to be what they've been
			waiting for.
			Data, you're going to be the only
			one unaffected by the hypersonic
			burst. As soon as everyone's
			unconscious, you've got to get to
			the computer panel and stop that
			ship somehow.
			I will try, sir.
			Kelsey -- perhaps we can work out
			a deal.
			You're the only one who needs a
			deal, Mott.
			My name's not Mott. It's Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			Captain Picard... this is all
			beginning to make sense...
			Leave the trilithium here and take
			me with you. You can use me as a
			hostage instead of threatening --
			I'm not a terrorist Captain, and
			I don't have a political agenda...
			But I know some people who do have
			agendas... and who are very
			interested in this little
			container.
			Profit. This is all about profit.
			I prefer to think of it as
			commerce.
			Open the door.
			Now go through... slowly.
			I guess, I'll be the one to send
			your regrets.
			Arkaria base, this is Captain
			Picard. Deactivate the baryon
			sweep.
			This is Captain Picard on the
			Enterprise. Deactivate the baryon
			sweep immediately.
			Data to Captain Picard... do you
			read me Captain?
			Picard here.
			Are you all right, Captain?
			Yes.
			Sir, an unidentified scout ship
			has just beamed someone off the
			Enterprise. Do you know anything
			about it?
			I know they won't get very far.
			Hold still... you've got a nasty
			cut here...
			Any luck?
			I'm sorry, Captain. I don't know
			what could've happened to it.
			I've had three security teams
			search deck seven and they
			couldn't find anything.
			Hold still. I can't heal this
			cleanly if you keep fidgeting.
			I found it, Captain. Someone put
			it in a maintenance locker.
			Thank you.
			You keep a saddle on board?
			Worf, I'm surprised at you...
			Any experienced rider would
			naturally have his own saddle.
			It's perfectly normal.
			Of course.
			It came in very handy.
			I just wish I'd had a chance to
			use it on a horse.
