			Captain's Log, Stardate 46578.4.
			The Enterprise has arrived at
			Station Deep Space Nine, where we
			will assist in the reconstruction
			of the Bajoran aqueduct systems
			damaged during the Cardassian
			occupation.
			I should be finished with the
			water contaminant analysis in a
			few hours. Then I'm going to try
			one of the Holosuites.
			I hear they've got a relaxation
			program here from Alture Seven.
			First you get bathed in a protein
			bath... and then a cloud of
			chromal vapor carries you into a
			meditation chamber... You should
			try it.
			I'm afraid I won't have the time.
			I'll be too busy discussing the
			finer points of water management
			with ten Bajoran bureaucrats.
			And they won't be carrying me on
			chromal vapor...
			What is this?
			Pasta al fiorella -- you'll love
			it.
			I'd like to take a look at those
			Ktarian antiques... I hear there's
			a twenty-first century plasma coil --
			in perfect condition.
			First we eat... then we shop.
			Commander -- I am reading a minor
			power drain in the Starboard EPS
			conduits.
			What's causing it?
			The problem is originating in
			Sickbay. There has been an
			unauthorized access into the
			computer's bio-imaging systems.
			You'd better check it out.
			Aye sir.
			Excuse me. Do you have
			authorization to work in this
			area?
			Come here... come here... I need
			a hand with this field
			generator...
			See if you can boost the power
			output to sixty-five percent.
			I am sorry. Use of Sickbay
			equipment is limited to the ship's
			medical personnel.
			Doctor Julian Bashir -- Chief
			Medical officer, Deep Space Nine.
			And you are Commander... ?
			Data.
			Commander Data... the synthetic
			lifeform?
			Yes.
			An honor to meet you, sir. I've
			heard so much about you...
			You must have a fascinating
			perspective on bio-cybernetic
			research. I'd be delighted if we
			could discuss the subject
			sometime...
			I would be happy to do so.
			However, I must ask you to stop
			your experiment.
			Yes, of course... you're right.
			I realize I should have asked
			before using your Sickbay.
			It would've taken me days to
			analyze this device with the
			computer I have on DS Nine...
			What type of device is it?
			It was discovered in the Gamma
			Quadrant. I think it may be some
			kind of medical instrument.
			It appears to employ beam inputs.
			I'm hoping it's a medical scanner.
			I want to use your computers to
			find out how it works.
			I suggest we go to Engineering and
			begin with a full circuit pathway
			diagnostic.
			Splendid.
			I must admit, Commander... I
			didn't think you'd be so...
			personable.
			I'll have to talk to Chief O'Brien
			about the replicators.
			I don't know how you can keep
			eating it...
			It tastes like... liquid polymer.
			Delicious.
			I think I'll try the kiosk on the
			other side of the Promenade. It
			looked like they've got real food.
			Klingon... you are the Starfleet
			Klingon.
			Yes... I am Lieutenant Worf.
			Worf... son of Mogh?
			What of it?
			I am Jaglom Shrek. A man with
			information to sell.
			You have no information I could
			want.
			I wouldn't be so sure...
			It is about your father... Mogh.
			My father died twenty-five years
			ago at Khitomer.
			That is what you believe...
			What if I told you... he is still
			alive?
			My father is dead.
			He's not. I know where he is.
			How is that possible?
			I expect to be paid for my
			information. Perhaps we can
			negotiate an exchange. The
			location of your father, for fifty
			bars of --
			Tell me what you know.
			Not all of the Klingons at
			Khitomer were killed during the
			massacre. Many were captured by
			the Romulans... and placed in a
			prison camp on a remote planet...
			Your father was among them.
			Where is this planet?
			Not far from here... I can give
			you the location... for a price.
			A Klingon would rather die than be
			taken prisoner. I should kill you
			for spreading lies about my
			family.
			My father was killed defending
			Khitomer.
			Ensign Lopez.
			This duty roster is unacceptable.
			The assignments must be listed in
			order of priority. Prepare it
			again.
			I will expect it no later than oh
			nine hundred hours. Understood?
			Worf, I'll need that rendezvous
			schedule sent over to Commander
			Rudman on the Merrimac as soon as
			you --
			I am aware of your request,
			Commander.
			Lieutenant... are you alright?
			I am... fine, sir.
			I will send the schedule... Excuse
			me, sir...
			Enter.
			Did the table do something wrong?
			No...
			I'm glad you weren't that hard on
			Ensign Lopez.
			He made a mistake. The duty
			roster was inaccurate.
			Would you like to talk about
			what's bothering you... or would
			you like to break some more
			furniture?
			Today on the Promenade... I was
			approached by a Yridian. He knew
			who I was... and tried to sell me
			information about... Mogh.
			Your father?
			He claimed that my father is
			alive... being held in a Romulan
			prison camp.
			My god... could it be true?
			A Klingon would never allow
			himself to be captured. A warrior
			fights to the death.
			If my father were alive... it
			would dishonor his sons and their
			sons for three generations...
			Even Alexander would bear the
			burden of guilt.
			So you're willing to ignore the
			possibility... because you're
			concerned about dishonor?
			My father is dead -- the Yridian
			is selling lies!
			If you're so sure of that... why
			are you still upset?
			Worf... you can't deny the
			possibility just because you don't
			want it to be true.
			If you want to talk about this...
			you know where to find me.
			If we transfer twenty megajoules
			of energy from the dilithium
			chamber into the plasma inputs, it
			should be enough to activate the
			device.
			Sounds like it's worth a try.
			You two can start by connecting
			the coil to the chamber. I'll
			configure the energy transfer...
			Right.
			Data... may I ask you a personal
			question?
			Certainly.
			Does your hair grow?
			I can control the rate of my
			follicle replenishment. However,
			I have not yet had a reason to
			modify the length of my hair.
			Why do you ask?
			Just curious...
			Power conduits ready...
			Is there something wrong, Doctor?
			You're breathing...
			Yes. I do have a functional
			respiration system. However, its
			purpose is to maintain the thermal
			control of my internal systems.
			I am, in fact, capable of
			functioning for extended periods
			in a vacuum.
			And you have a pulse...
			My circulatory system not only
			produces bio-chemical lubricants,
			but regulates micro-hydraulic
			power.
			Most people are usually interested
			in my extraordinary abilities.
			How fast I can compute, my memory
			capacity, how long I will live.
			But no one has ever asked me if my
			hair can grow, or noticed that I
			can breathe.
			Your creator went to a lot of
			trouble to make you seem human...
			I find that fascinating.
			We're ready to begin the transfer.
			The power connections are
			complete.
			I'll monitor the coil's saturation
			rate. Will you keep an eye on the
			transient power response?
			Of course.
			We are ready, Geordi.
			Initiating energy transfer...
			Power levels are holding steady...
			Transient response is normal.
			Hold on... I'm picking up a power
			surge...
			Reduce the transfer rate...
			Reducing rate by... twenty
			percent.
			Geordi -- shut it down!
			His net's been overloaded --
			Data, are you alright?
			I believe so.
			What happened?
			A plasma shock overloaded your
			positronic net. You were down for
			a good thirty seconds.
			That cannot be correct.
			I have a memory record for that
			period of time. I can recall a
			series of images.
			I saw Doctor Soong... my father.
			I can't find anything wrong with
			your positronic sub-processors...
			or with your controllers...
			No sign of a residual energy
			fluctuation... cascade
			overload...
			My internal diagnostic indicates
			that my memory systems are
			functioning within normal
			parameters.
			For the forty-seven seconds that
			I was inactive, there is no record
			of any cognitive activity.
			There's no doubt about it, Data --
			you were completely shut down.
			Maybe you had some kind of random
			power fluctuation... and it
			accessed one of your memory files.
			That is not possible. The image
			I saw was of Doctor Soong as a
			young man. I encountered him only
			much later in his life.
			There does not appear to be a
			rational explanation for my
			experience.
			I'll take a look at the diagnostic
			log again...
			In the meantime, we'd better
			disconnect that medical device...
			Maybe we're going about this the
			wrong way...
			What do you mean?
			Maybe you had a dream... or a
			hallucination...
			I am not capable of either of
			those functions.
			But you can't account for what
			happened today... can you?
			At present, I cannot.
			Maybe you should approach this
			from a more... human standpoint.
			You're right that machines can't
			have hallucinations...
			But then again... most machines
			can't grow hair.
			Wait.
			What is it, Commander?
			I am sorry to bother you. But I
			have a question of a personal
			nature. Do you have a moment?
			A moment.
			I have heard you mention that you
			once experienced a vision.
			Yes... when I was young... my
			adoptive parents arranged for me
			to partake in the Rite of MajQa.
			I understand it involves deep
			meditation inside the lava caves
			of No'Mat. Prolonged exposure to
			the heat induces a hallucinatory
			effect.
			I spent six days in the lava
			caves. For five days I saw
			nothing. Then, on the sixth day,
			as I was preparing to leave the
			caves... Kahless came to me.
			Kahless. The entity you invoke
			during the Klingon Death Ritual?
			When he appeared before me... he
			told me that I would do what no
			Klingon had ever done.
			You did become the first Klingon
			in Starfleet.
			Yes. It is as he said.
			Why are you asking me about this?
			I have recently had an unexplained
			experience, which might be
			described as a "vision".
			What happened?
			An accident in Engineering shut
			down my cognitive functions for a
			short period of time. And yet, I
			seemed to remain conscious.
			I saw my father.
			You are fortunate. That is a
			powerful vision.
			If it was a vision, I am not sure
			how to proceed.
			You must find its meaning.
			If it has anything to do with your
			father, you must learn all you can
			about it.
			In the Klingon MajQa ritual, there
			is nothing more important than
			receiving a revelation about your
			father.
			Your father is part of you...
			always. Learning about him tells
			you about yourself...
			That is why, no matter where he
			is... or what he's done... you
			must find him.
			But I am not looking for my
			father.
			Yes, of course...
			Do not stop until you have the
			answer.
			Thank you, Worf.
			Lieutenant Worf... you have
			reconsidered...
			Yes. I wish to go to the Romulan
			prison camp.
			Excellent. I can provide you with
			the coordinates...
			No. You will take me there.
			That is impossible. I have no
			means of transportation --
			I checked the station records.
			You have a vessel capable of warp
			speed.
			I do not... have the time... I
			have other business...
			What is the real reason you do not
			want to take me? Is it because
			what you have said is not true?
			The camp is located on the edge of
			Romulan space. It is a dangerous
			journey...
			Dangerous...
			It would be more dangerous for you
			to refuse.
			Very well... But I will require
			full payment in advance...
			I will pay you after.
			But --
			Yes... yes, of course. After.
			And if you are lying... if there
			is no prison camp...
			I will kill you.
			The Romulan guards have a
			detection perimeter. It will be
			necessary to transport you to the
			surface thirty kilometers from the
			prison camp.
			The foliage is very dense. It
			will take me approximately twelve
			hours to reach the camp.
			I will have to travel during the
			night.
			That would be unwise. This is not
			an empty jungle. There are many
			predators.
			I am prepared.
			Very well. But I would recommend
			that you look up from time to
			time. The arboreal needle snake
			likes to attack from above.
			I will provide you with a map of
			the camp...
			How did you learn of this camp?
			That is not important for you to
			know.
			Why have you not informed the
			Klingon government of this place?
			I sell information... I do not
			give it away.
			You withhold this information...
			for profit.
			I have my reasons, Mister Worf.
			What reason could you have for
			letting these people suffer?
			We will arrive in the Carraya
			Sector in approximately three
			hours. I suggest you get some
			rest.
			Come.
			Yes, Mister Data?
			I am sorry to disturb you, sir.
			Not at all. I'm just studying the
			intricacies of Bajoran aqueduct
			management...
			I could use an interruption about
			now. Please, sit down.
			I require your advice. I have
			come to an impasse regarding my
			recent unexplained experience.
			Oh yes... of course... your
			"vision" of Doctor Soong. How's
			your investigation coming along?
			I have analyzed over four thousand
			different religious and
			philosophical systems, as well as
			over two hundred psychological
			schools of thought in an effort to
			understand what happened.
			What have you found?
			I have been unable to find a
			single interpretation of the
			images I saw during the time I was
			shut down.
			The image of a hammer, for
			instance, could have many
			different meanings. Klingon
			culture views the hammer as a
			symbol of power. However, the
			Taqua tribe of Nagor views it as
			an icon of hearth and home. The
			Feregni see it as a sign of sexual
			prowess.
			I'm curious. Why are you looking
			at all these other cultures?
			The interpretation of visions and
			other metaphysical experiences are
			almost always culturally derived.
			And I have no culture of my own.
			Yes you do. You are a culture of
			one. And that's no less valid
			than a culture of one billion.
			Perhaps the key to understanding
			your experience is to stop looking
			into other sources for meaning...
			You wouldn't look at
			Michaelangelo's David... or
			Symnay's Tomb... and ask "what
			does this mean to other people?"
			The real question is, "what does
			it mean to you?"
			Explore the image, Data. Let it
			capture your imagination. Focus
			on it... spend some time with
			it... and see where it takes you.
			Let it inspire you.
			I believe I understand, sir.
			Thank you.
			Good luck, Data.
			The camp is in a Southeasterly
			direction. After approximately
			ten kilometers, you will reach the
			edge of the sulfur canyons. Look
			for a riverbank -- follow it
			until you reach the camp.
			This is a homing device. It will
			allow you to find my ship when I
			return. I will not be landing in
			the same location.
			When will you be back?
			Fifty hours.
			Do not be late.
			Who's there?
			Toq... is that you?
			I can see you...
			I hope you're enjoying yourself.
			Toq, I swear I will hang you by
			your...
			Stop, please...
			Who are you?
			I have come to help you...
			Help me... ?
			Yes...
			How did you get out of the camp?
			Does anyone know you are gone?
			Yes... I come here often...
			You must lead me to the camp.
			You are Klingon... Where have you
			come from?
			That does not matter. I am here
			to take you home.
			Home... this is my home...
			It is important that you tell no
			one you saw me.
			Enter.
			Data, where have you been? We
			were supposed to...
			Data... what are you doing?
			I am painting.
			I can see that...
			How long have you been at this?
			I have created twenty-three
			individual illustrations over the
			past six hours, twenty-seven
			minutes.
			I believe you could say -- I have
			been "inspired."
			I'll say...
			I have done as Captain Picard
			suggested: I have tried to explore
			the images.
			Has it helped?
			I am not sure.
			I began by painting the image of
			the blacksmith. Then the anvil.
			The hammer. Doctor Soong's face.
			The thought then occurred to me
			that I should paint -- smoke.
			Smoke... why smoke?
			I cannot explain it. It was not
			an image I saw during my vision.
			Well... you have the smoke coming
			out of a bucket of water.
			Blacksmiths sometimes used water
			to cool the metal. Maybe that's
			why you painted it...
			Perhaps.
			After I painted smoke, it occurred
			to me to paint -- a bird's wing.
			I then drew an entire bird. A
			flock of birds flying in
			formation. An individual feather.
			If the image of a bird is related
			to my vision, I do not understand
			how.
			I am left with more of a mystery
			than ever.
			Geordi, I would like to recreate
			the experiment which caused my
			initial shut down.
			What for?
			I do not know how much longer my
			vision would have continued, had
			I not been reactivated.
			Your neural net was almost fused
			by that plasma shock. I don't
			think it's such a good idea to try
			it again...
			I am aware of the risks involved.
			But I can see no other way to
			investigate my experience.
			Will you help me?
			Okay... I'll get Doctor Bashir.
			And I will prepare the power
			transfer.
			We're going to monitor every subsystem
			in your positronic net. If
			I see any neural pathways overload
			beyond sixty-five percent... I'm
			shutting down the experiment.
			Agreed.
			We're ready.
			Initiating energy transfer...
			Get ready, Data...
			Power levels are rising...
			Should be any second now...
			That bird did not appear in my
			original experience. This vision
			is different.
			Of course it's different.
			It's never the same. Always
			changing. Unpredictable. It
			doesn't make sense...
			Father, what is happening?
			I don't know, Data. What is
			happening?
			We are on the Bridge of the
			Enterprise. My cat is present,
			and my potted plant, and my
			paintings.
			A wonderful beginning. Still a
			little grounded in the mundane,
			but showing promise...
			I do not understand.
			You're not supposed to. No man
			should know where his dreams come
			from. It spoils the mystery...
			the fun.
			I'm proud of you, son. I wasn't
			sure you'd ever develop the
			cognitive abilities to make it
			this far...
			But if you're here... if you can
			see me... it means you've crossed
			the threshold from being a
			collection of circuits and
			subprocessors... and have started
			a wonderful journey.
			What type of journey?
			Think of it as an empty sky.
			I do not understand.
			Shhh.... just dream, Data...
			dream...
			You are the bird.
			The images I saw during the time
			I was shut down were generated by
			a series of previously dormant
			circuits in my neural net.
			I believe Doctor Soong
			incorporated those circuits into
			my base programming, intending
			them to be activated when I
			reached a certain level of
			development.
			But the plasma shock activated
			them prematurely...
			That is correct.
			I'm curious... now that those
			circuits are active... what do you
			intend to do with them?
			I plan to shut down my cognitive
			functions for a brief period of
			time each day.
			I hope to generate new internal
			visions.
			It sounds like you're talking
			about dreaming...
			An accurate analogy.
			Remarkable... This is just the
			kind of thing that could get me
			published in the Starfleet
			Cybernetics Journal...
			Would you mind if I authored a
			paper about all this?
			Of course not.
			Thank you, Data.
			And... sweet dreams.

			ghIH yot quelI'Pa qevas HoH Qa... "
			"teblaw'nghu mughato'Du ylja'Qo'
			ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo'... "
			Quiet! I am a friend.
			Who... who are you?
			I am Worf... son of Mogh.
			Why have you come here?
			I have come to find my father. Is
			he alive? Is he here?
			Your father... fell at Khitomer.
			Did he... die in battle?
			He was fortunate.
			You were captured...
			During the battle, many Klingons
			were taken prisoner. We fought
			our captors... but we failed...
			The Romulans robbed you of your
			right to die with honor.
			There is little time. How many
			Klingons are being held here?
			Seventy-three...
			How many Romulans guard the camp?
			Worf... there are... things you do
			not understand...
			What do you mean?
			I must... speak with the Elders.
			ghoS! (Come!)
			I knew your father well, Worf...
			And I remember you... a boy...
			barely able to lift a Bat'telth...
			Once... your father insisted we
			take you on the ritual hunt. You
			were so eager, you tried to take
			the beast with your bare hands...
			it mauled your arm...
			Yes... I still have the scar...
			I remember you now...
			You should not have come here,
			Worf.
			I do not understand.
			You should not have come.
			Who is this?
			I am Worf... son of Mogh. I have
			come to help you escape.
			He does not know.
			He must leave at once...
			No. It is too late for that. He
			would bring others...
			vang ghaH! (Take him!)
			We are not leaving here. And
			neither are you.
