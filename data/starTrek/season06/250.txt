			Captain's Log, Stardate 46915.2.
			The Enterprise is orbiting Nervala
			Four, waiting for an opportunity
			to retrieve scientific data left
			there by Starfleet researchers
			when they were forced to evacuate
			eight years ago.
			Thank you... thank you very much.
			Any requests tonight?
			Night Bird.
			Anyone?
			Night Bird!
			Ladies and Gentlemen... Night
			Bird.
			What was that all about?
			Wil's been trying to get this
			piece right for ten years now.
			He's never made it through the
			solo.
			Remember that dance recital I told
			you I was doing?
			Next week.
			You're dis-invited.
			Here it comes.
			Data to Commander Riker.
			Riker, here.
			Commander, you are needed on the
			Bridge.
			On my way.
			Saved by the bell...
			You wanted to see me, Data?
			Yes, sir. It appears that we will
			be able to transport to the
			surface sooner than we
			anticipated.
			Is the planet's distortion field
			de-phasing sooner than you
			predicted?
			No, sir. But using the Potemkin's
			transport logs from the original
			evacuation, Commander La Forge and
			I were able to modify the
			Transporters.
			So we can beam through higher
			distortion levels.
			The Transporters are now
			considerably more efficient than
			those used on the Potemkin eight
			years ago.
			Glad to hear it. I almost didn't
			make it off the surface that day.
			When can we get started?
			Ninety-seven minutes.
			How long will the transport window
			last?
			Twenty-six minutes. After that,
			the distortion field will re-phase.
			That doesn't give us much time to
			retrieve the database.
			The planet's proximity to its sun
			will create two additional
			transport windows in the next
			three days.
			Let's hope that's enough.
			It will have to be. The next
			transport window will not occur
			for another eight years, when the
			planet's orbit brings it close
			enough to the sun to de-phase the
			distortion field.
			Notify the Away Team we're going
			in ahead of schedule; I'll tell
			the Captain.
			How long until the transport
			window opens?
			Fourteen seconds.
			Let's get in position.
			Whenever you're ready, Commander.
			Energize.
			This isn't how I remember it; the
			place was a mess when we left.
			Commander...
			Someone's been here...
			A vessel could have gotten caught
			in the distortion field and
			crashed. The survivors may have
			taken shelter here.
			Commander, someone is
			approaching... a humanoid. Forty
			meters due east and closing.
			Who are you?
			Who are you?
			Commander William Riker of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise.
			That's not possible. I'm Wil
			Riker.
			May I ask how you got here?
			Eight years ago, I led a team to
			evacuate this station.
			What ship were you on?
			The Potemkin.
			Why did you not return to the
			Potemkin with the others?
			I was the last one out. The
			distortion field must have
			interfered with the transport;
			they lost their signal lock on me.
			When I tried to contact the ship,
			I couldn't get through the
			interference.
			Check with Starfleet; I'm sure
			they recorded me lost that day.
			That's not what happened. I was
			the last one out... but I made it
			back to the Potemkin.
			You don't believe me.
			It's not that we don't believe
			you; it's just hard to see how
			both our stories could be true.
			Would you be willing to let our
			Doctor check you out?
			Of course.
			Lieutenant Worf, take him to
			Sickbay. Notify the Captain as
			soon as you're aboard.
			Worf to Enterprise. Two to beam
			up.
			Let's get to work.
			Looks like you fractured your arm
			a few years ago.
			I was underneath the station
			making repairs when an earthquake
			hit -- I got caught in a
			rockslide. I had to set it
			myself.
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			Lieutenant Wil Riker, sir.
			If you are Wil Riker, if there are
			two of you... then something
			extraordinary has occurred. I
			hope you understand our need to
			verify your claim.
			Yes, sir.
			Genetically, he's
			indistinguishable from Commander
			Riker.
			Could some sort of cloning be
			involved?
			I don't think so, there's no
			genetic drift.
			But that isn't conclusive.
			That's why I compared their brain
			scans. Brain organization
			patterns are as unique as...
			fingerprints. Except for some
			minor differences, theirs are
			identical.
			Can't brain patterns be cloned?
			No. They're determined by
			experience, mostly in early
			childhood.
			How could two men have shared the
			same childhood experiences? It
			doesn't make any sense.
			Sir, I am Wil Riker. I don't know
			who or what made it back to the
			Potemkin that day, but it wasn't
			me.
			Lieutenant -- my Chief Engineer is
			checking over the transport logs
			from the Potemkin. They may shed
			some light on what happened.
			Yes, sir.
			Don't worry, we'll get to the
			bottom of this.
			In the meantime you'll be taken to
			quarters. Make yourself
			comfortable.
			I will, sir. The replicators on
			the station stopped working a long
			time ago. It's been a while since
			I had a decent meal.
			Doctor...
			... apparently there was a massive
			energy surge in the distortion
			field around the planet just at
			the moment you tried to beam out.
			The Transporter Chief tried to
			compensate by initiating a second
			containment beam.
			An interesting approach. He must
			have been planning to reintegrate
			the two patterns in the transport
			buffer.
			Turns out he didn't have to.
			Commander Riker's pattern
			maintained its integrity with just
			the one containment beam -- he
			made it back to the ship just
			fine.
			What happened to the second beam?
			The Transporter Chief shut it
			down, but somehow... it was
			reflected back to the surface.
			And another Wil Riker materialized
			there.
			How could the second pattern have
			maintained its integrity?
			The containment beam must have had
			the exact same phase differential
			as the distortion field.
			Which one of us is... real?
			Both. You were both re-materialized
			from a complete
			pattern.
			Up to that moment, you were the
			same person.
			But over the last eight years, you
			and...
			-- Lieutenant Riker have lived
			very different lives. You're
			different people now.
			For us, it's a little like meeting
			a close friend's twin. You can't
			help feeling that you know them...
			but of course you don't.
			No matter how strange it may seem
			to us... there are now two Wil
			Rikers aboard this vessel.
			Getting used to the idea may take
			a while... especially for you,
			Wil.
			I'll be all right, sir.
			Lieutenant Riker will be here for
			a few days at least. We should do
			everything we can to make him feel
			comfortable and welcome.
			That still leaves us with the
			problem of how to retrieve the
			database. The station's computer
			is only partially operational.
			Many of its components have been
			removed. Apparently Lieutenant
			Riker used them to keep the
			station's radiation shield
			operational.
			Can we repair it, at least enough
			to access the database?
			Without knowing what he did, it'll
			be tough.
			Maybe he could help?
			He was alone down there a long
			time. I'm hesitant to send him
			back until he's been evaluated.
			I'll talk to him.
			Thank you, Counselor.
			Come in.
			Hello, Wil.
			Imzadi...
			Wil...
			I thought I'd never see you
			again...
			We need to talk.
			You're here... on this ship...
			because of him.
			No.
			Commander Riker and I are friends,
			close friends; nothing more.
			Wil -- why don't we sit down?
			Do you remember the last time we
			saw each other?
			Like yesterday. We spent the day
			at the Janaran falls, on Betazed.
			It was the day before you started
			your tour on the Potemkin.
			We were going to meet six weeks
			later, on Risa.
			We never did.
			I know.
			What I mean is... Commander Riker
			and I never did.
			You see... he earned a promotion
			very quickly.
			I know.
			For exceptional valor during the
			evacuation of the research station
			on Nervala Four.
			I looked over his service record.
			He chose to make his career a
			priority. There wasn't time for
			much of anything else.
			We kept in touch... but we didn't
			see each other again until we were
			both posted to the Enterprise two
			years later.
			By then, our feelings for each
			other had changed. We've served
			together for six years now...
			things never went back to the way
			they used to be.
			I had a lot of time on my hands
			down there. There were days I
			felt so alone I thought I might
			lose my mind.
			Do you know what got me through?
			Thinking that if I could hang on,
			one more day, maybe I'd be
			rescued... and I'd see you again.
			Well... I guess things don't
			always turn out quite the way you
			expect them to.
			I know this isn't what you were
			hoping for, but that doesn't mean
			you can't make a future for
			yourself.
			For now, I think I'll just take
			things one day at a time.
			Captain Picard wanted me to find
			out if you'd be willing to help us
			retrieve the station's database.
			I reconfigured that computer
			system so many times they probably
			can't make heads or tails of it.
			I'd be happy to help.
			Do you feel up to it?
			Absolutely.
			I'll tell the Captain.
			Well... I have to go.
			Deanna... I know it's been a long
			time since we were together; I
			know your feelings have changed.
			But...
			Mine haven't. I can't just give
			up and accept that it's over... I
			want to be with you again.
			Good night, Wil...
			Phase distortion is dropping --
			the second transport window will
			open in forty-two seconds.
			How long will we have?
			Thirty-six minutes, sir.
			We are losing time. Lieutenant
			Riker should be here.
			Computer, where is Lieutenant --
			Cancel inquiry.
			You were supposed to report here
			at eight hundred hours.
			I'm sorry, I was --
			I guess it's been a while since
			you had to punch a clock.
			Let's go.
			Energize.
			I shut down most of the consoles
			to save power. I re-routed just
			about everything through here.
			Check out the primary EPS
			coupling, see if you can get some
			power to the rest of these
			consoles.
			I shunted the database to the main
			core underneath the station.
			Can we access it from here?
			There's been a lot of seismic
			activity over the years; if the
			servo-links were damaged, we may
			not be able to.
			I'll try to tap into the command
			pathways. See if you can disable
			the file server.
			I was thinking... we should
			probably let Dad know what's
			happened.
			I'm sure he'll be thrilled to hear
			there are two of us now.
			I don't know. He and I patched up
			a few things.
			I've gotten by without talking to
			him for a long time. I'm not
			about to start now.
			What made you contact him?
			I didn't. He came to the
			Enterprise to brief me when I was
			offered the Aries.
			What did he say when you turned
			down the chance to command your
			own ship?
			He couldn't understand why I did
			it.
			For once he and I agree on
			something.
			The primary EPS coupling is fused.
			It will have to be replaced.
			I've accessed the command
			pathways.
			Let's see if that does the trick.
			It's not working. The servo-link
			must be damaged. We're going to
			have to go under the station and
			access the core directly.
			We have less than three minutes
			left.
			Leave me here. If I start now,
			I'll be finished by the time the
			third window opens.
			It's too dangerous. Our scans
			show the caverns are unstable.
			I've been down there dozens of
			times; I know my way around.
			We'll come back during the third
			window with a new EPS coupling and
			try to access the core from
			another console up here.
			Riker to Enterprise.
			Enterprise, here.
			We're ready to beam up.
			You go ahead; I'll be finished by
			the time you get back.
			Hold it --
			I gave you an order, Lieutenant.
			Computer -- valerian root tea,
			hot.
			Meet me in Transporter Room Three
			at nineteen hundred hours. It's
			important.
			It pulses unendingly
			All through the night;
			Seek out the crystal
			That powers our flight.
			Can I help you with something,
			Counselor?
			No -- thanks, anyway.
			What the future holds
			No one can know
			But forward we look
			And Forward you go...
			The Janaran falls...
			I remember. Where did you get
			this?
			I made it... a few years ago, down
			on the station.
			You made this?
			You should have seen the first
			two. It took me a while to get a
			fine enough beam from the phaser.
			It's lovely. Thank you.
			Do you have time to sit and talk
			for a while?
			I wanted to remember... our last
			night together.
			How does it feel being with people
			again?
			Great...
			A little strange...
			For a long time, I did whatever I
			wanted, whenever I wanted; it's
			hard to get used to taking orders
			again.
			I can imagine.
			I guess I'm going to have to if I
			want to get my career going.
			Is that what you've decided to do?
			Don't you remember? How I wanted
			to make Captain by the time I was
			thirty-five?
			I'm a little behind schedule, I'll
			admit.
			It's good that you don't feel...
			set back.
			I do. But I promised myself that
			if I ever got out of there, I'd
			make up for lost time.
			Things are a little more
			complicated than I thought they'd
			be... but I'm not going to let
			anything stop me from getting what
			I want.
			Thanks.
			I can't tell you how many times I
			thought about you... about us.
			The first few weeks after the
			evacuation, I was sure they'd find
			a way to get through the
			distortion field and come back for
			me.
			I even thought we'd meet on Risa
			like we planned.
			But the days kept going by and
			nobody came. Then I realized why.
			They thought I'd been killed in
			the beam out. As far as anyone
			knew, there was no one to come
			back for.
			I figured they probably held a
			memorial service for me.
			Somehow... it made me feel
			better.
			I can understand that.
			You were there... all in black.
			Very flattering on you, by the
			way.
			I'm sure I looked terrible -- my
			eyes all red and swollen from
			crying.
			Sometimes I'd look up into the sky
			and think that maybe, if I tried
			hard enough, I could somehow make
			you... feel my presence. I
			thought that if I could let you
			know I was still alive... maybe
			you'd wait for me.
			I know it's crazy, but there were
			a few times that... that I
			could've sworn --
			What am I talking about?
			The other day, when I told you how
			Commander Riker and I didn't meet
			on Risa... what I didn't say was
			how disappointed I was.
			You didn't have to. I knew.
			I started hearing from him less
			and less... I knew his career was
			taking him away from me, but I
			didn't want to believe it was
			over. I spent a lot of time
			thinking about him, wondering
			where he was, what he was doing.
			Sometimes I'd look up into the
			sky... and imagine that he knew,
			that he could sense me thinking
			about him.
			Who knows? Maybe one night... you
			and I were both looking up at the
			same star. You were thinking
			about me... and in a way, I was
			thinking about you.
			You wanted to see me, Sir?
			Yes, Number One. Come in.
			Lieutenant Riker came to see me
			about the away mission.
			He believes the only way to
			retrieve the database is by
			directly accessing the main core
			underneath the station.
			Seismic activity has made the
			caverns very unstable. In my
			opinion, it's too risky.
			He said he'd been down there quite
			recently; he seems confident it
			can be done safely.
			There's a good chance we can
			retrieve the database from one of
			the consoles inside the station.
			But if that doesn't work, it'll be
			eight years before we get another
			chance.
			Lieutenant Riker's plan is more
			dangerous, but I'll admit, it has
			a better chance of succeeding.
			Given the importance of this data,
			I think it's worth the risk.
			I'll look over the schematics and
			draw up a mission plan.
			I'm sure Lieutenant Riker would be
			happy to help you with that.
			I'll talk to him.
			Lieutenant.
			Sir.
			I just spoke with the Captain
			about your mission recommendation.
			I'd appreciate it if next time you
			came to me first.
			I tried to, yesterday on the
			station. You wouldn't hear me
			out.
			I heard you, Lieutenant. And I
			rejected your plan.
			May I ask what the Captain
			decided?
			He's going with your
			recommendation, but that's not the
			point.
			Isn't it?
			If you think I'm coming down on
			you because the Captain overruled
			me, think again. I happen to
			disagree with his decision, but
			he's my commanding officer and I
			follow his orders. Just so
			there's no confusion, I'm your
			commanding officer and I expect
			you to do the same. If you can't,
			then you don't have a place on my
			Away Team.
			Yes, sir.
			We're meeting in the Observation
			lounge at fourteen hundred hours
			to draw up a mission plan.
			... we stayed in Ten Forward
			talking for hours.
			What happened then?
			He walked me to my quarters.
			What happened then?
			Beverly --
			I'm just asking.
			It's been over between Wil and me
			for a long time.
			He's not Wil. He is, but -- you
			know what I mean.
			I do. But... it's hard for me to
			separate my feelings for them.
			Deanna... just because things
			turned out the way they did
			between you and Commander Riker...
			that doesn't mean you shouldn't
			let things with Lieutenant Riker
			take their own course.
			I should have known you'd
			encourage me.
			Isn't that why you brought it up?
			Well... I think I'll call it a
			day.
			Beverly.
			Bye.
			Is that some form of tai-chi-chuan?
			They're Klingon exercises,
			actually. Lieutenant Worf has
			been teaching a class.
			The forms are very similar.
			Do that last move again.
			You just did the KoH-man-ara.
			In tai-chi-chuan, it's called the
			crane block.
			I had no idea they were so
			similar.
			Let's try something else.
			Very nice. Worf's a good teacher.
			Hello, Wil.
			Deanna...
			I wanted to talk to you about
			something.
			If you want to be with him... you
			don't have to ask my permission.
			There's a certain look in your
			eyes. I know... you used to have
			it for me.
			We've both had relationships with
			other people before; but this is
			different.
			I didn't know how you would feel
			about it.
			Flattered.
			Sort of.
			It must be very strange for you.
			I know it is for me.
			Ever since he came aboard... I
			keep finding myself thinking
			about... the choices you and I
			made.
			Me too.
			Just do one thing for me... be
			careful.
			Wil... I know you and he have had
			some problems --
			We have. But that's not what I'm
			talking about.
			If he'd made it off that planet
			instead of me... don't you think
			he would have made the same
			choices I did?
			I just don't want you to get
			hurt... again.
			Two pair.
			Three of a kind.
			I'd like to thank you both for
			your very generous contributions.
			Come in.
			I thought -- you'd be alone.
			Excuse me.
			Why don't you join us?
			Why not?
			The game is five card draw, no
			limit.
			Lieutenant?
			Three.
			Mister Worf?
			Four.
			None for me.
			The dealer will take two.
			You control the bet.
			Fifty.
			Fold.
			I'm in.
			You didn't take any cards -- you
			must be holding something. Why
			not make it sweeter?
			No thanks.
			Playing it safe?
			You in?
			I will see your fifty and call.
			Staying in will cost you another
			hundred.
			The dealer folds.
			I spent too much time practicing
			in the mirror to be fooled by that
			face. You're bluffing.
			If there's one thing I thought
			would be clear by now, it's that
			you and I play things a little
			differently.
			We'll see who comes out on top.
			I thought you didn't mind settling
			for second. Commander.
			I've never settled for anything in
			my life. I've made choices that
			some people may not understand,
			but I know what I want -- and I
			know what I've got. You'd be
			lucky to do as well.
			Lieutenant.
			I'll see your hundred and call.
			Three hundred.
			Now I know you're bluffing.
			Are you in or not?
			Why don't we just get this over
			with? I'll match your three, and
			raise you whatever you have left.
			Well?
			Take it. You win.
			You were dealt the better hand,
			Commander... all the way around.
			Come in.
			I'm sorry to just drop by like
			this... but there's something
			important I need to talk to you
			about.
			Captain Picard made some inquiries --
			he helped me find a posting on the
			Gandhi.
			Considering how long I've been out
			of commission, it's an amazing
			opportunity.
			When would you leave?
			About a week.
			I see.
			Deanna...
			After I've served on the ship for
			six months, I'll be eligible to
			bring family aboard.
			If we got married...
			You said those exact words to me
			once before... when you first went
			to serve on the Potemkin.
			I remember.
			I got held up for a while.
			But if you hadn't... what would
			have happened between us?
			I wouldn't've made the mistake of
			letting you go. I know that much.
			I don't know if I can believe
			that.
			It took me a long time to get over
			what happened between Commander
			Riker and me. I don't know if I
			want to put myself in that
			position again.
			I would never hurt you, Deanna.
			It's not just that... I've worked
			hard to make a life for myself on
			the Enterprise. I'm happy here.
			If the situation were different,
			I'd stay here. But I can't... not
			while he's aboard.
			I know.
			Are you saying it's over?
			No.
			I just don't know if I'm ready to
			give up my life here.
			Maybe we both need time to think.
			Good night.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. The
			third transport window has opened
			and the Away Team is making their
			final attempt at retrieving the
			database.
			Once we restore the servo-link,
			you can shunt the database up to
			this console.
			Ready, Commander?
			You're with me, Lieutenant.
			I thought Commander Data's
			expertise in --
			It doesn't take that much
			expertise to repair a servo-link.
			You and I can handle it.
			I am curious about something,
			Lieutenant. If you met a double
			of yourself, would you find it
			difficult to interact with him?
			I think so.
			Why?
			I am not... easy to get along
			with.
			But Commander Riker and Lieutenant
			Riker are. Yet they seem to have
			trouble getting along with each
			another.
			I have found that humans value
			their uniqueness, their sense that
			they are different from every one
			else. The existence of a double
			would preclude that feeling.
			Could that be the source of
			friction?
			Perhaps it is more a matter of
			seeing something in your double...
			something you don't like about
			yourself.
			There's the core over there.
			Are you waiting for something?
			Your order. Sir.
			How would you like me to get
			there?
			You've been down here "dozens" of
			times -- I'm sure you know the
			best way.
			Yes, sir. I do.
			It's leaking ion radiation.
			Why didn't you report this?
			It wasn't there before; it must
			have happened recently.
			If we have to repair this conduit,
			we won't have time to access the
			computer core.
			Scan it now.
			It worked. Radiation levels are
			dropping to normal levels.
			Next time don't give up so easily.
			I'm being pulled in --
			Let go.
			Let go.
			One of us has to make it out of
			here --
			Take my hand --
			No --
			Take it!
			Climb --
			They have restored the servo-link
			to the core. We can begin
			downloading the database.
			Initiating data transfer.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 46920.1.
			We have retrieved the database
			from Nervala station and are
			headed for our rendezvous with the
			Gandhi.
			Come in.
			I understand the Gandhi is going
			on a terraforming mission to the
			Lagana Sector.
			It'll take four months just to get
			there.
			I won't be going with you.
			I guess I'm not surprised.
			I'm not ready to give up my life
			here.
			Not yet.
			Come in.
			I'm sorry --
			It's all right.
			I wanted to give you something...
			My quarters are full of things
			that used to be yours. I figured
			you should at least have this.
			Thanks.
			Good luck, Wil.
			Actually... I was thinking of
			going with the name Thomas.
			Your middle name.
			I guess we are different. I never
			really cared for it.
			I've always kind of liked it.
			Well... I better get going.
			Take care of her.
			I waited a long time. I can wait
			a little longer.
