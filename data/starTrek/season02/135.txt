			Captain's log, stardate 42523.7.
			We are in route to newly
			established Starbase one-seven-three for port
			call. Crew rotation is scheduled,
			and we will offload experiment
			modules.
			Hold it, that's my chair. My luck
			is always lousy unless I start
			on the dealer's left.
			That would seem to be rank
			superstition.
			Bitter experience has taught me
			it's a fundamental truth.
			The game is five card stud,
			nothing's wild.
			This game is exceedingly simple.
			With only fifty-two cards,
			seventeen of which I will see,
			and four players there are a
			limited number of possible winning
			combinations.
			There's more to it than just the
			cards.
			The bets will give an indication
			of the relative strengths of each
			hand.
			Time to pluck a pigeon.
			I think I'm in trouble.
			I'll raise five.
			Too rich for me.
			I will raise you three.
			Your three and five more.
			Is this what is known as the poker
			face?
			Are you playing or not?
			I will fold.
			You had nothing.
			He bluffed you, Data.
			It makes very little sense to bet
			when you cannot win.
			But I did win. I was gambling
			that you wouldn't call.
			But how can you tell?
			Instinct, Data, instinct.
			The game is seven card high/low
			with a buy on the last card. And
			just to make it interesting the
			man with the axe takes all.
			My God, if it isn't Phillipa
			Louvois, back in uniform.
			Don't gloat, Picard. It's almost
			more irritating then when you're
			being self-righteous.
			Unbelievable, after all this time,
			and we're picking up the threads
			of old fights as if we'd never
			been apart.
			Ain't love wonderful.
			What are you doing out here?
			I'm in charge of the Sector
			twenty-three JAG office. I'll
			be making some good law.
			And maybe do a little good along
			the way, too. What do you think?
			Anything is possible. You
			returned to Starfleet.
			I had to, it's the most exciting
			and worthwhile place to be.
			You didn't have to leave.
			They forced me out.
			No. That was your own damn
			stubborn pride.
			When I prosecuted you in the
			Stargazer court-martial I was
			doing my job.
			No, you went way beyond doing the
			job. You enjoyed it.
			Not true! A court-martial is
			standard when a ship has been
			lost. I had a duty as an officer
			in the Judge Advocate General.
			Flummery, you've always enjoyed
			the adversarial process more than
			arriving at the truth.
			Well, I hope you've learned a
			little wisdom.
			Watch it, you're doing it again.
			I'm not being self-righteous.
			Merely right.
			A distinction, I would submit,
			without a difference.
			Come and sit down.
			I can't stay long. I'm meeting
			someone for dinner.
			But he hasn't arrived yet.
			What makes you think it's a man?
			Past experience.
			Cute. Try to remember that you're
			an officer and a gentleman.
			You know, I never thought I would
			say this, but it is good to see
			you again. You're still a damn
			sexy man, Picard.
			So buy me dinner.
			I thought you were meeting
			someone?
			Once again you're always right,
			Jean-Luc.
			Admiral.
			Captain Louvois. You're
			acquainted with Captain Picard?
			Yes, we're old... friends.
			Captain, good to see you again.
			May I present Commander Bruce
			Maddox. He has an interesting
			proposal for you.
			But that can wait until later.
			I'm eager to see the Enterprise.
			Admiral, Commander Maddox, allow
			me to introduce my first officer,
			Commander William Riker.
			Pleasure, Commander.
			How long has it been since we've
			seen each other?
			You'd just been assigned as an
			ensign aboard the old Reliant.
			Oh yes, and I seem to remember
			a certain young lieutenant who
			had harsh words about snap
			inspections, and the admirals who
			pulled them.
			The situation changes when you've
			got the admiral's stripes.
			There isn't an officer in
			Starfleet who wouldn't give his
			right leg to be where you are -- Captain
			of the Starship
			Enterprise. I'm no different.
			I just have the power to get
			aboard.
			Happy to have you, Admiral.
			Bridge. Congratulations on your
			appointment. Command of a
			Starbase.
			Thank you, but I miss a ship.
			A bit of advice, Captain. Don't
			ever become an admiral. They make
			you an administrator.
			Admiral on the bridge.
			I was a little surprised at the
			decision to put a base in force
			this close to the Neutral Zone.
			As you know, we've had disturbing
			news from both sides of the zone.
			We're here to respond as needed.
			And it won't hurt to have the
			Romulans know we're nearby.
			Well, Captain, I thank you for
			this opportunity. For five
			hundred years ships who've borne
			the name Enterprise have been a
			legend. This one is no different.
			Admiral.
			Oh yes, Captain. Commander Maddox
			is here to do some work on your
			android. Please take care of him.
			Lieutenant Worf.
			How have you been, Data?
			My condition does not alter with
			the passage of time, Commander.
			The two of you are acquainted?
			Yes, I evaluated Data when it
			first applied to the Academy.
			And were the sole member of the
			committee to oppose my entrance
			on the grounds that I was not a
			sentient being.
			What exactly will this work
			entail?
			I'm going to disassemble Data.
			I think we will remove this
			discussion to the lounge.
			Explain this procedure.
			Ever since I first saw Data at
			its entrance evaluation at
			Starfleet Academy, I've wanted
			to understand it. I became a
			student of the works of Doctor
			Noonien Soong -- Data's creator.
			I've tried to continue his work,
			and I believe I am very close to
			the breakthrough which will enable
			me to duplicate Soong's work and
			replicate this.
			But as a first step I must
			disassemble and study it. Data
			is going to be my guide.
			Data?
			It sounds intriguing.
			How will you proceed?
			I'll run a full diagnostic on
			Data, evaluating the condition
			of its software. I'll then dump
			its core memory into the starbase
			mainframe computer and begin a
			detailed analysis of its
			construction.
			You have constructed a positronic
			brain?
			Yes.
			Have you determined how the
			electron resistance across the
			neural filaments is to be
			resolved?
			Not precisely.
			That would seem to be a necessary
			first step.
			I'm confident that I'll have the
			answer once I've examine the
			filament links in your anterior
			cortex.
			But if the answer is not
			forthcoming, your model will not
			function.
			I don't anticipate a problem.
			You seem a little vague on the
			specifics. What are the risks
			to Commander Data?
			Negligible.
			His basic research lacks the
			specifics necessary to support
			an experiment of this magnitude.
			Data is a valued member of my
			bridge crew. Based on what I've
			heard I cannot allow him to submit
			to your experiment.
			I thought this might be your
			attitude, Captain.
			Here are Starfleet's transfer
			orders separating Commander Data
			from the Enterprise, and
			reassigning it to Starbase one-seven-three
			under my command. Data, I'll
			expect you in my office at nine
			hundred hours tomorrow.
			Look, it's a transfer, like any
			other transfer.
			No, it's not. This is one of my
			key officers, and he's been
			removed without consulting me.
			I'm sorry about that, but
			Commander Maddox's work in
			robotics is considered critical
			by Starfleet Command. Think
			what's at stake here. If
			Commander Maddox can succeed in
			duplicating Noonien Soong's work
			other captains on other ships
			would have the advantage you now
			enjoy: a Data on every bridge.
			You don't want Data transferred,
			fine. There's an easy solution.
			Have him work with Commander
			Maddox. Nakamura out.
			Come.
			You sent for me, sir?
			Please, sit down. We've got a
			problem.
			I find myself in agreement with
			that assessment of the situation,
			sir.
			Your service to this ship has been
			exemplary. I don't want to lose
			you.
			I am pleased to hear you say so.
			Thank you.
			There is a solution which presents
			itself.
			Yes, sir?
			Undergo the procedure, then the
			transfer order becomes moot.
			I will not submit to this
			procedure.
			Data, I understand your objections
			to this procedure, but I also have
			to consider Starfleet's interests.
			If Commander Maddox is correct
			there is a possibility that many
			more beings such as yourself could
			be constructed.
			True, but possibility is a word
			which can encompass any number
			of outcomes -- good and bad.
			But if he's right, Starfleet would
			be immeasurably enriched.
			Captain, I am a Starfleet
			officer. Can they force me to
			do this?
			It's precisely because you are
			a Starfleet officer that they can.
			We take an oath to serve. In this
			case this is the form your service
			is taking.
			Sir, Lieutenant La Forge's eyes
			are far superior to human
			biological eyes, true?
			Yes.
			Then why are not all human
			officers required to have their
			eyes replaced with cybernetic
			implants?
			I see. It is precisely because
			I am not human.
			That will be all, Mister Data.
			Computer. Pull all relevant
			Starfleet regulations concerning
			officer transfers.
			Working.
			My God, twice in as many days.
			I need your help.
			An historic moment.
			I've been trying to make heads
			or tails of this gibberish, and
			it's finally defeated me. My
			android officer has been
			transferred so he can undergo a
			highly dangerous procedure. I
			want to stop it.
			He can refuse to undergo this
			procedure, but we can't stop the
			transfer.
			Once Maddox has Data under his
			control anything could happen.
			I don't trust that man.
			We agree to certain risks when
			we join Starfleet.
			Acceptable risks, justified risks,
			yes, but I can't accept this.
			It's unfair and unjust. What
			about his rights...
			All this passion over a machine.
			Don't start. Is there an option?
			There's always an option. He can
			resign.
			So you came to me for help.
			Yes, I came to you. You're the
			JAG officer in this sector. I had
			to come to you.
			Wait! I didn't mean it that way.
			I'm... I'm glad that you thought
			you could... well, come to me.
			Trust is too painful a word.
			I wish things were different for
			us.
			"When in disgrace with fortune
			I all alone beweep my outcast
			Is it just words to you, or do
			you fathom the meaning?
			It is customary to request
			permission before entering an
			individual's quarters.
			I thought we could talk this out,
			that I could try to reassure you.
			Your memories and knowledge will
			remain intact.
			Reduced to mere sterile facts
			of the events. The substance,
			the flavor of the moment could
			be lost. Take games of chance...
			Games of chance?
			Yes, I had read and absorbed every
			treatise and textbook upon the
			subject, and felt myself tolerably
			well prepared for the experience.
			Yet, when I finally played poker,
			I discovered that the reality bore
			little resemblance to the rules.
			The point being?
			That while I believe that you can
			download the information contained
			in the positronic brain, I do not
			think you have acquired the
			expertise necessary to preserve
			the heart of those experiences.
			There is an ineffable quality to
			memory that I do not believe can
			survive the shutdown of my core.
			Ineffable quality. I would
			rather that we had done this
			together, but one way or the other
			we are doing it. You're under
			my command.
			No, sir, I am not under your nor
			anyone else's command. I have
			resigned from Starfleet.
			Resigned. You can't.
			I regret the decision, but I must.
			I am the culmination of one man's
			dream. This is not ego or vanity,
			but when Doctor Soong created me
			he added to the substance of the
			universe. If by your experiments
			I am destroyed, something unique
			and wonderful will be lost. I
			cannot permit that, I must protect
			the dream.
			And so must I. Keep packing,
			you will be reporting.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Commander Bruce Maddox, having
			been thwarted by Data's abrupt
			resignation from Starfleet is now
			seeking a legal remedy for his
			woes. Captain Louvois has
			requested my presence at those
			discussions.
			Your response is emotional and
			irrational. You're endowing Data
			with human characteristics because
			it looks human. But it's not.
			If it were a box on wheels I
			wouldn't be facing this
			opposition.
			Overt sentimentalism is not one
			of Captain Picard's failings.
			Trust me, I know.
			Data is a valued member of my
			crew, an outstanding bridge
			officer, a --
			If I'm permitted to make this
			experiment the horizons for human
			achievement become boundless.
			Consider, every ship in the
			Federation with a Data on board.
			Utilizing their tremendous
			capabilities. Acting as our hands
			and eyes in dangerous situations.
			That is worth a little
			inconvenience.
			Look, you're preaching to the
			choir here.
			So why don't you get to the point?
			Data must not be permitted to
			resign.
			He's an officer in Starfleet.
			He has certain rights...
			Rights! Rights! I'm sick to
			death of hearing about rights!
			What about my right not to have
			my life work subverted by blind
			ignorance?
			We have rule of law in this
			Federation. You can't simply
			seize people, and experiment with
			them to prove your pet theories.
			Now you're doing it. Data is an
			extraordinary piece of
			engineering, but it is a machine.
			If you permit it to resign it will
			destroy years of work in robotics.
			Starfleet doesn't have to allow
			the resignation --
			Starfleet is not an organization
			that ignores its own regulations
			when they become inconvenient.
			Whether you like it or not, Data
			does... have... rights.
			Let me put it another way. Would
			you permit the computer on the
			Enterprise to refuse a refit?
			An interesting point, but the
			Enterprise computer is property.
			Is Data?
			Of course.
			There might be law to support that
			position.
			A decision with such broad-ranging
			implications must be supported
			by an official ruling.
			And I trust you will apply the
			same zeal to your research that
			you used during the Stargazer
			court-martial.
			You're supposed to rip the
			wrapping off a present.
			But with the application of a
			little care, Wes, the paper can
			be utilized again.
			You're missing the point.
			The Dream of the Fire, by K'Ratak.
			Thank you, Worf.
			It was in the hands of the
			Klingons that the novel attained
			its full stature.
			I couldn't disagree more, but
			we'll save that argument for
			another day. Now listen
			carefully. I didn't get you a
			present --
			That is quite all right. None
			was expected...
			Instead I'm going to give you
			something far more valuable -- my
			advice. You've spent years
			in the womb of Starfleet. Now
			you're about to start a new life.
			You'd be wise to consider the
			experiences offered by
			groundside living.
			Thank you. I will take that under
			advisement.
			Excuse me, please.
			Is something wrong?
			Of course there is. You're going
			away.
			No one regrets the necessity more
			than I, but you do understand my
			reasons?
			Oh yeah, I understand. I just
			don't like your being forced out.
			It's not fair.
			Doctor Pulaski would, at this
			juncture, no doubt remind us that
			life is rarely fair.
			Sorry, but that doesn't make it
			any easier.
			I shall... miss you.
			Me too.
			You take care, Data.
			Deanna... does Data have...
			do you feel anything from him?
			I can't sense anything from Data.
			But that proves nothing. There
			are many minds from which I can
			read no meaning.
			There's got to be more to him than
			software, nets and chips.
			It is possible that Commander
			Maddox is correct and we are
			anthropomorphizing Data.
			Assigning to him emotions and
			responses which he may not have.
			I'm not sure I see that as a
			problem.
			A little farewell celebration?
			Yes, to which I don't recall
			inviting you.
			I couldn't miss this. I can't
			wait to hear Data's plans.
			They are currently somewhat
			indefinite, but my programming
			offers a number of alternatives.
			I am considering teaching. I have
			had some success with my star
			pupil.
			I have a better idea. Carnival
			work. They could bill you as the
			walking encyclopedia. Ask him
			any question --
			Number One, Captain Louvois has
			called. We're expected in her
			office. Meet me in Transporter
			Room Five.
			On my way.
			I know you're just leaving. I'll
			escort you.
			I have completed my research,
			and based on the Acts of Gould
			passed in the early twenty-first
			century, Data is the property of
			Starfleet. He cannot resign and
			he cannot refuse to cooperate with
			Commander Maddox.
			And if I challenge this ruling?
			I will be required to hold a
			hearing.
			Then I so challenge. Convene your
			hearing.
			Captain, that would be exceedingly
			difficult. This is a new base.
			I have no staff --
			Surely there are regulations to
			cover this eventuality.
			There are. I can use serving
			officers as legal counsel. You
			as senior officer would defend.
			Very well.
			And who gets the unenviable task
			of prosecuting this case?
			You do. The next most senior
			officer aboard defendant's ship.
			I can't. I won't. Data's my
			friend, my comrade. We've served
			together and I not only respect
			him, I have affection for him.
			This isn't about friendship. This
			is about duty, and how we search
			for truth.
			A system that pits people against
			each other can't be the answer.
			When people of good conscience
			have an honest dispute we
			sometimes must resort to this kind
			of adversarial system.
			You want me to try and prove that
			Data's a mere machine. I can't.
			I don't believe it. I know he's
			more than that. I'm neither
			qualified nor willing to do this.
			You're going to have to find
			someone else.
			Then I'll rule summarily based
			upon my findings. Data's a
			toaster. Have him report to
			Commander Maddox immediately for
			experimental refit.
			I see I have no choice but to
			agree.
			Good. But you better do your duty
			in that courtroom. If I think
			for one minute that you're not
			giving me your best effort I'll
			end this right then and there.
			You don't have to remind us of
			our duty. Just remember yours.
			I've never forgotten it. Not
			then, and certainly not now.
			Captain Louvois has issued a
			ruling that you are the property
			of Starfleet Command. You can't
			resign.
			I see... from limitless options
			I am reduced to none, or rather
			one. I can only hope that
			Commander Maddox is more capable
			than it would appear.
			No, you're not going to submit.
			We're going to fight this.
			Captain Louvois may be overly
			attached to the letter of the law,
			but she has not forgotten its
			spirit. She's convening a hearing
			and we are going to lay the
			question of your legal status to
			rest once and for all.
			I have been asked to represent
			you, but if there is some other
			officer with whom you would feel
			more comfortable --
			Captain, I have complete
			confidence in your ability to
			represent my interests.
			Care to try your hand, Number
			One?
			Another time. It's too close to
			our real contest.
			This isn't about you and me.
			Isn't it? Data may be the issue,
			but our performances are what will
			be judged.
			That's the nature of the
			adversarial process.
			Which can only work when the
			opponents are of equal ability.
			Are you suggesting that we are
			not evenly matched?
			No, but for Data's sake it has
			to be said. I've been forced into
			this, and I have only one option.
			To give this my best effort.
			I see.
			Then... you are here...
			to warn me...
			that you are going to do...
			Everything within your power and
			within the boundaries of the
			law...
			to win!
			Yes.
			So am I.
			All right, I'm going to need to
			know everything about you.
			Sir, all of that information is
			stored in the Enterprise computer
			banks.
			I want to hear it from you.
			Very good, sir. Activation
			occurred twenty-seven years ago
			on Omicron Theta. I entered the
			Academy in '44, and graduated in
			'48 with honors in probability
			mechanics and exobiology. First
			posting...
			Data, Data, Data, whoa, stop.
			I could get this from the
			computer.
			I believe I indicated that
			earlier, sir.
			I need to know how you think,
			what you want, how you feel. What
			drives you, motivates you.
			Drives? Motivates? Sir, may I
			inquire as to the purpose of this
			line of questioning?
			We have to prove that you're a
			sentient life-form.
			But I am not. I am a machine.
			That's not what I need to hear.
			How can we deny the obvious?
			We're searching for an argument
			which will legally deny that
			obvious fact.
			But if it is a fact how can
			argument alter --
			Data!
			Sir?
			Stop babbling.
			The law recognizes many things
			as people that aren't possessed
			of flesh and blood. It's a little
			legal fiction, you see.
			I am beginning to understand why
			Shakespeare wrote, let us kill
			all the lawyers.

			Advocate General has rendered a

			Your honor, there is only one
			issue in this case and one
			relevant piece of evidence. I

			Objection, your honor, I want it

			Sustained.
			... Gallantry, Medal of Honor with
			clusters, Legion of Honor, the
			Star Cross.
			Commander Data, what are you?
			An android.
			Which is?
			Webster's Twenty-Third Century
			Dictionary, Fifth Edition, defines
			Android as an automaton made to
			resemble a human being.
			An automaton. Made. Made by
			whom?
			Sir?
			Who built you, Data?
			Doctor Noonien Soong.
			And he was?
			The foremost authority in
			cybernetics.
			More basic than that. What was
			he?
			A human?
			Thank you. Data, what is the
			capacity of your memory, and how
			fast can you process information?
			I have an ultimate storage
			capacity of eight hundred
			quadrillion bits. My total linear
			computational speed has been rated
			at sixty trillion operations per
			second.
			Your honor, I offer into evidence
			prosecution's exhibit A. A bar
			of plasteel with a tensile
			strength of forty kilo-bars.
			Commander Data, would you please
			bend that.
			Objection, your honor. Many races
			possess meta-human strength. It's
			not relevant to the issue before
			this court.
			I'm afraid I can't agree, Captain.
			Proceed with the demonstration,
			Commander Riker.
			Drawing on the log record of the
			construction of the prototype
			android Lore, also constructed
			by Noonien Soong, I request that
			I be allowed to remove Commander
			Data's hand for your inspection.
			Objection! What is the point of
			all this?
			The issue before this court is
			whether Data is machine, and by
			extension property. I'd say this
			is pretty damn relevant.
			I'm sorry.
			Data is a physical representation
			of a dream, an idea conceived of
			by the mind of a man. His
			purpose? To serve human needs
			and interests. He is a collection
			of neural nets and heuristic
			algorithms. His responses are
			dictated by an elaborate software
			program written by a man. The
			hardware
			was built by a man.
			And this man has turned him off.
			Pinocchio is broken, the strings
			are cut.
			I request a recess.
			Granted.
			You should get some sleep.
			I've lost, and I'm not even sure
			I mind. Data is a machine. But
			there is something bothering me.
			Something I'm missing. Or is it
			just wounded pride that I've lost
			and in front of her.
			What is it that lies between you?
			Ancient history.
			Unfortunately the past always
			resonates in the present, and
			decisions made today reach into
			the future.
			The Stargazer court-martial. It
			should have been a routine
			hearing. Yes, I had lost my ship,
			but my actions were entirely
			justified.
			Phillipa was assistant to the
			prosecution. She dug up every
			obscure case and citation and the
			panel hammered at me for three
			days. It damn near ended my
			career. It did end us. She's
			enjoying this situation. She
			knows I disapprove of the
			adversarial system. Now she's
			forced me into active
			participation, and she's both
			pleased and angered to see me fail.
			Emotions. They're such slippery,
			contradictory things. It's a
			wonder any of us ever crawled out
			of the oceans, or swung down out
			of the trees.
			Well, there's only one thing to
			do. I go to her in the morning,
			and we discuss a deal.
			I had heard a lot about you before
			I joined the Enterprise. About
			how Picard was a man who never
			knew when to lie down and admit
			he was beat.
			I have to salvage at least some
			of Data's rights. If Data agrees
			to undergo Commander Maddox's
			procedure we can get out of this
			hearing before he's declared the
			property of Starfleet command.
			If Commander Maddox is successful
			in disassembling and reassembling
			Data, what has he gained?
			The ability to build another.
			A hundred others, a thousand.
			To do what?
			Explore for us. Enter the
			dangerous situations.
			All those future Datas risking
			their lives for the people who
			created them.
			You said something earlier about
			decisions today.
			Having implications for the
			future.
			Precedent! This case will set
			the precedent for all the future
			Datas. It will determine their
			status, and they'll all be
			property.
			There is an ancient word for it -- slavery.
			Not a word we want back in our
			vocabulary.
			Good luck, sir.
			Commander Riker has dramatically
			demonstrated to this court that
			Lieutenant Commander Data is a
			machine. Do we deny that? No.
			But how is this relevant? We too
			are machines, just machines of
			a different type. Commander Riker
			has continually reminded us that
			Data was built by a human. We
			do not deny that fact. But again
			how is it relevant? Does
			construction imply ownership?
			Children are created from the
			building blocks of their parents'
			DNA. Are they property? We have
			a chance in this hearing to
			severely limit the boundaries
			of freedom. And I think we
			better be pretty damn careful
			before we take so arrogant a step.
			I call Lieutenant Commander Data
			to the stand.
			What are these, please?
			My medals.
			Why pack them? What logical
			purpose do they serve?
			I... I do not know, sir. None
			I suppose. I just wanted them.
			Is that vanity?
			And this?
			It was a gift from you, sir.
			You value it?
			Yes, sir.
			Why?
			It is a reminder of friendship
			and service.
			And this? You have no portraits
			of any other of your crewmates.
			Why this person?
			I would prefer not to answer that
			question, sir. I gave my word.
			Mister Data, may I remind you, that
			you are under oath.
			And under the circumstances, I
			don't think Tasha would mind.
			She was important to me... we
			were... intimate.
			I have no further questions of
			this witness.
			Commander Riker, do you wish to
			cross?
			I have no questions, your honor.
			I call to the stand Commander
			Bruce Maddox as a hostile witness.
			Verify, Maddox, Bruce, Commander.
			Current assignment, Chair of
			Robotics, Federation Institute
			of Technology. Major papers...
			Enough. Suffice it to say, he's
			an expert.
			Commander Maddox, it is your
			contention that Data is not a
			sentient being and therefore not
			entitled to those rights reserved
			for all other life-forms in this
			Federation?
			Data is not sentient, no.
			Why, Commander?
			Because Data is a piece of
			outstanding engineering and
			programming.
			What is required for sentience?
			Intelligence, self awareness,
			consciousness.
			Do you know what sentience is,
			Commander?
			Of course.
			Excellent. Then you can enlighten
			the rest of us.
			Prove to this court that I'm
			sentient.
			This is absurd!
			Why? Because you can't do it?
			No, it's just pointless. We all
			know you're sentient.
			So I'm sentient, but Data isn't?
			That's right.
			Why?
			Well... well, you're self aware.
			Ah, the second ingredient. But
			let's deal with the first
			requirement. Is Data
			intelligent?
			Yes.
			Why?
			It has the ability to learn and
			understand, and to cope with new
			situations.
			Like this hearing. What about
			self awareness. What does that
			mean? Why am I self aware?
			Because you are conscious of your
			existence and actions. You're
			aware of yourself and your own
			ego.
			Data, what are you doing now?
			I am taking part in a legal
			hearing to determine my rights
			and status. Am I property or
			person?
			And what's at stake?
			My right to choose. Perhaps my
			very life.
			My rights. My status. My right
			to choose. My life. He seems
			pretty damn self aware to me.
			Well, Commander Maddox, I'm
			waiting.
			This is exceedingly difficult...
			Do you like Data?
			I don't know it well enough to
			like or dislike it.
			But you admire him?
			Oh yes, it's an outstanding --
			Piece of engineering and
			programming. Yes, you've said
			that. You've devoted your life
			to the study of cybernetics in
			general?
			Yes.
			And Data in particular?
			Yes.
			And now you're proposing to
			dismantle him.
			So I can rebuild him and construct
			more!
			How many more?
			Hundreds, thousands. There's no
			limit.
			And do what with them?
			Use them.
			How?
			As effective units on Federation
			ships. As replacements for
			humans in dangerous situations.
			So much is closed to us because
			of our fragility. But they...
			Are expendable.
			It sounds harsh but to some
			extent, yes.
			Are you expendable, Commander
			Maddox? Never mind. A single
			Data is a curiosity, a wonder,
			but a thousand Datas, doesn't that
			become a new race? And aren't
			we going to be judged as a species
			about how we treat these
			creations? If they're expendable,
			disposable, aren't we? What is
			Data?
			What? I don't understand.
			What... is... he?
			A machine!
			Is he? Are you sure?
			Yes!
			But he's met two of your three
			criteria for sentience, and we
			haven't addressed the third. So
			we might find him meeting your
			third criterion, and then what
			is he?
			I don't know. I don't know!
			He doesn't know.
			Do you? That's the decision
			you're facing. Your honor, a
			courtroom is a crucible. In it
			we burn away the egos, the selfish
			desires, the half-truths, until
			we're left with the pure product
			-- a truth -- for all time.
			Sooner or later it's going to
			happen. This man or others like
			him are going to succeed in
			replicating Data. And then we
			have to decide -- what are they?
			And how will we treat these
			creations of our genius? The
			decision you reach here today
			stretches far beyond this android
			and this courtroom. It will
			reveal the kind of a people we
			are. And what
			... they are going to be. Do you
			condemn then to slavery?
			Starfleet was founded to seek out
			new life.
			Well, there he sits, your honor,
			waiting on our decision. You have
			a chance to make law. Well, let's
			make a good one. Let us be wise.
			This case touches on metaphysics,
			and that's the province of
			philosophers and poets. Not
			confused jurists who don't have
			the answers. But sometimes we
			have to make a stab in the dark,
			and speak to the future. Is Data
			a machine? Absolutely. Is he
			our property? No... (this will
			be rewritten with additions).
			You see, sometimes it works.
			Continue your work, Commander,
			and when you are ready I will
			still be here.
			You'd be willing after what I've
			put you through?
			Yes, it would be a less lonely
			universe if there were more of
			my kind.
			He's remarkable.
			You didn't call him "it."
			Sir, there is a celebration on
			the Holodeck.
			I have no right to be there.
			Because you failed in your task?
			No, God, no. Data, I came this
			close to winning.
			Yes, sir.
			I could have cost you your life!
			Yes, that is true, but
			Commander... Will, I have learned
			from your experience.
			What could you have possibly
			learned from this kind of ordeal?
			That at times one must deny their
			nature, sacrifice their own
			personal beliefs to protect
			another. Is it not true that had
			you refused to prosecute, Captain
			Louvois would have ruled summarily
			against me?
			Yes.
			That action injured you, and saved
			me. I will not forget.
			You're a wise man, my friend.
			Not yet sir, but with your help
			I am learning.
