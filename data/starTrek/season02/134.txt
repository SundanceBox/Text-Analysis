			We are approaching Starbase
			one-seven-nine.
			Half impulse, Mister Crusher.
			Going to half impulse.
			Captain, this is the bridge. We
			have arrived at Starbase
			one-seven-nine.
			Acknowledged, Number One.
			Establish position -- zero-nine-zero mark
			three-seven-five -- at
			twenty-seven thousand
			kilometers.
			Aye, sir.
			Open hailing frequencies,
			Lieutenant.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Starbase one-seven-nine, this is
			the USS Enterprise.
			Enterprise, this is Starbase
			one-seven-nine. We are ready for
			transfer on your mark.
			Thank you.
			Commander Data, you have the
			bridge. Ensign Crusher, you will
			accompany me.
			Starbase one-seven-nine. We are
			ready to commence transfer.
			Acknowledge Enterprise. Begin
			transfer.
			This is my last chance to say that
			it has been a pleasure to serve
			with you and to wish you luck on
			your new assignment. You have
			served the Enterprise well.
			No tears, please.
			Energize.
			Enterprise ready. Beam aboard.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
			I'm Commander William Riker, your
			first officer. Those of you who
			are here as replacements will step
			outside and Lieutenant Lewis will
			assign you to crew quarters.
			Ensign, you are here on the
			exchange program, you'll follow
			Mister Crusher.
			Mordoc, what are you doing here?
			You couldn't have graduated from
			the Academy already.
			I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon.
			Ensign Mendon of the planet
			Benzar.
			I'm sorry sir. I thought you were
			a friend... Mordoc...
			... You look just like him.
			We are from the same
			geostructure. Naturally we look
			alike.
			How do you tell each other apart?
			We just do.
			Well, nice to have you here
			Ensign. There will be a
			briefing and indoctrination
			session as soon as you settle in.
			I want to tell you how happy I
			am to be assigned to the
			Enterprise. It wasn't just luck.
			I requested it. I know I can
			be of great help to the ship.
			Yes, of course. Now if you'll
			just follow Ensign Crusher.
			Yes sir.
			Commander Riker, report to the
			Phaser Range, please...
			On the way.
			I was wondering if you had any
			feelings about the Officer
			Exchange Program that has been
			initiated by Starfleet Command.
			Just positive ones sir. I've
			already welcomed Ensign Mendon
			on board and he certainly seems
			eager to please.
			That's a Benzite trait.
			It's been suggested that one of
			the officers on the Enterprise
			might like to participate in this
			exchange program.
			Probably a good idea.
			There's a Klingon vessel in the
			vicinity.
			I don't recall ever hearing of
			a Federation officer serving on
			a Klingon vessel.
			Neither have I.
			It could be beneficial.
			Having Worf on board certainly
			has been.
			Yes sir, that's true.
			Who did you intend to send?
			I was going to ask for a
			volunteer.
			I wouldn't mind, sir.
			What was that, Number One?
			I said I wouldn't mind the
			assignment.
			Any particular reason?
			Because nobody has ever done it
			before.
			I'll notify starbase of your
			acceptance... They'll contact the
			Klingon vessel and make the
			arrangements.
			Captain's log, stardate 42606.5.
			I have informed the staff of
			Commander Riker's temporary duty
			assignment and we have departed
			from Starbase one-seven-nine and
			are headed for a rendezvous with
			the Klingon vessel, the Pagh.
			I have studied and know everything
			about my heritage.
			Then you are the one to fill me
			in on something that I'm not
			clear about.
			It's my understanding that one
			of the duties of the first officer
			on a Klingon ship is to
			assassinate the captain.
			Yes sir.
			Wouldn't that bring about chaos?
			Of course not. When and if the
			captain becomes weak and unable
			to perform, it is expected that
			his honorable retirement should
			be assisted by his "first."
			The second officer would
			assassinate you for the same
			reasons.
			This method of attrition could
			take a little getting used to.
			The Klingon system has operated
			successfully for centuries.
			It is different.
			Many things will be different.
			That's a wonderful method of
			maintaining a constant control
			factor over defensive shields,
			but I'm sure there's a way to
			improve response time.
			Oh, sorry, didn't mean to
			interrupt you... Just thought I
			could be of some help, however
			I am correct in what I said.
			That is superb designing,
			absolutely first rate.
			Yes it is. Would you care to
			be more specific?
			The input sampling. It's simple
			yet efficient enough. Of course
			a minor change of the helm
			readout would be much more
			helpful in emergency situations.
			We've never had any trouble with
			it. Have you seen it work?
			Not in a practical exercise, but
			in theory... my theory... it would
			be more than a marginal
			improvement. I'll have to mention
			this to the captain.
			You're going to advise Captain
			Picard?
			Captain Picard... I'll have to
			discuss these improvements with
			him.
			He is open to some astute
			observations, isn't he?
			Well, I've never heard Captain
			Picard refuse to listen to his
			officers.
			Outstanding! Pretty soon we'll
			get things running perfectly.
			What is this?
			A Klingon delicacy. That's heart
			of targ -- this is pipius claw.
			And this is stewed "gagh."
			"Gagh"?
			Serpent worms... would you like
			to know how they're prepared?
			No thanks. I've never heard of
			a Klingon starving to death on
			one of their own vessels, but you
			might.
			Not if I weaken first.
			I know all about that. Their
			beliefs may be somewhat brutal
			but usually what kills us, kills
			them.
			That's something to look forward
			to. Would you like a drink,
			Doctor?
			I'm abstaining in honor of your
			last hour on board.
			Your sacrifice will not go
			unnoticed.
			I understand the theory of the
			feast before the transfer. I've
			done the same thing dozens of
			times. However, I usually made
			more civil choices.
			These are the most civil choices.
			I see... Well, their food may be
			somewhat backward but the Klingons
			are efficient, loyal to their
			beliefs, and are regulated by a
			strict code of ethics.
			True enough. They tend to lean
			towards a Samurai civilization
			that is thousands of years old.
			But they are pure in that
			tradition.
			This is a great opportunity,
			Number One. We really know so
			little about them. We have so
			much to learn.
			I think I envy you, Will Riker.
			An emergency transponder?
			Slightly altered to transmit an
			omnidirectional signal and an
			emergency call.
			Are you sensing some trouble
			that I don't?
			Simply a security precaution.
			I want to insure your return to
			this ship.
			Sentiment, Lieutenant Worf?
			Efficiency, Commander.
			I understand. Thank you,
			Lieutenant.
			We have a Klingon vessel
			approaching.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			They are returning our hail in
			proper language. It is the Pagh.
			On viewscreen.
			I am Jean-Luc Picard, captain of
			the Enterprise.
			And I am Captain Kargan of the
			Pagh. Beam your first officer
			on board immediately.
			We are preparing to do so.
			You're getting a good man,
			Captain Kargan.
			Thank you for your opinion but
			I will judge that for myself.
			Screen off.
			Not very hospitable are they?
			That is not your concern. Observe
			your station, Ensign Mendon.
			Didn't mean to offend you.
			You didn't...
			... Yet.
			Transporter Room, prepare to beam
			Commander Riker aboard the Pagh.
			Ready, Captain.
			Good Luck, Commander.
			Thank you sir.
			On your command, Will.
			Energize.
			Viewscreen off. Resume course.
			Aye sir.
			Take over Commander Data, I'll
			be in my quarters.
			Yes sir.
			Sir, I'm Ensign Mendon. I just
			wanted to tell you how pleased
			I am to be aboard the Enterprise.
			Yes, of course. Nice to have you
			on board.
			If you have a few minutes I've
			noted a few procedural items that
			could speed up operations on the
			bridge.
			I pick things up very quickly.
			I'm sure you do Ensign, you
			have an excellent record.
			However, on the Enterprise we use
			the chain of command. You may
			report your observations to
			Lieutenant Worf.
			I didn't mean to challenge your
			authority...
			... I just wanted to impress upon
			you...
			No need to apologize Ensign...
			we should have explained it better
			during indoctrination.
			Ensign Mendon... You may impress
			me.
			Something wrong?
			No, Commander.
			It's just I have never seen anyone
			of your species before...
			I'm just your average everyday
			human who happens to be a
			commander. Now what are your
			orders?
			I am to escort you to the captain.
			Proceed.
			I am Commander William Riker of
			the Starship Enterprise.
			That is incorrect.
			I don't understand.
			You are Commander Riker, first
			officer of the Klingon Cruiser
			Pagh, or do you intend to
			disobey Federation orders?
			I have no such intentions,
			Captain.
			Exactly where are your loyalties,
			Commander?
			I'm afraid I still don't
			understand.
			This ship is equipped with our
			best weapons and our finest
			warriors. Although we are on a
			peaceful mission we are prepared
			to go into battle instantly. I
			know I can count on every Klingon
			warrior in this crew to serve and
			die in that battle. So I ask
			again Commander Riker,
			where are your loyalties?
			I have been assigned here to serve
			this ship and to obey your orders.
			I will do exactly that.
			Will you take an oath to that
			effect?
			I just did.
			yI-Har-Qo! nep-we' ghaH! (Do
			not believe him! He lies!)
			Hol-chaj yI-jatlh. (Speak in
			their language.)
			This is your second officer,
			Lieutenant Klag.
			Was there something you wanted
			to say to me, Lieutenant?
			Yes sir.
			I don't believe you.
			Then I take it you challenge my
			authority over you.
			Correct.
			And your position in this,
			Captain?
			I would call it your first command
			decision.
			My oath is between Captain Kargan
			and myself. Your only concern
			is how to obey my orders.
			Or do you prefer the rank of
			prisoner over that of lieutenant?
			I will take your orders.
			And you, Commander Riker, will
			obey my orders.
			Agreed, Captain Kargan.
			Sir, the automatic scan has
			registered some unknown substance
			on the aft quarter of the exterior
			skin of the dorsal fin.
			Zero in on that location and
			define.
			I've located it sir. The dorsal
			of the Engineering Section.
			On viewscreen. Focus on area.
			Magnification factor ten.
			Increase magnification to
			twenty.
			Analyze.
			The substance appears to be a rare
			form of subatomic "bacteria,"
			capable of doubling every fifteen
			minutes. It seems to be reacting
			with two of the compounds present
			in the Enterprise structure.
			Determine origin.
			I noticed it when I did an
			intensive scan of the Pagh,
			the Klingon ship.
			And you informed no one?
			I have not yet completed my full
			analysis.
			You are supposed to report
			whatever is out of the ordinary.
			This falls into that category.
			But sir, as I said I have not yet
			completed my analysis. It would
			be improper to report it until
			then.
			How did you come by that
			decision?
			It is a Benzite regulation. No
			officer on the deck of one of our
			ships would report an occurrence
			like this until he had a full
			analysis and a resolution.
			I have simply followed proper
			procedures.
			It is our procedure for you to
			bring to the attention of command
			any possibility of danger. You
			will not make those decisions.
			Is that clear, Ensign Mendon?
			Yes sir.
			Fine. Now I want you to complete
			the analysis and determine the
			danger not only to this ship but
			the Klingon vessel as well.
			Yes Captain... That will take a
			couple of hours.
			You'll remain at your station
			until it is complete, then report
			to me. Lieutenant Worf will
			supervise you.
			Yes sir.
			... and then I will instruct you
			in Enterprise etiquette.
			Commander's log, supplemental,
			Stardate 42607.8. I have been
			on the Pagh a short time but long
			enough to be impressed with the
			abilities and singlemindedness
			of the Klingons. I can now see
			why they have gained the respect
			of Captain Picard.
			You're not eating very much.
			Well, I'm not that hungry.
			Is the food all right, Commander?
			Fine. The "pipius" was excellent,
			and I also liked the "Bregit
			lungs."
			And the Rokeg blood pie?
			Excellent.
			Then you'll also like this.
			This is "gagh," isn't it?
			Very good. You did some research
			on our nutritional choices.
			Yes... but this is still moving.
			"Gagh" is always best when served
			live.
			Would you like something "easier"?
			Easier?
			If Klingon food is too strong for
			you, perhaps I could get one of
			the females to breast feed you.
			Don't tell me you're still
			concerned about my not
			weakening?
			Look around. You'll see that
			there are no old warriors.
			Of course, I'm sure they all died
			with honor.
			Exactly. You may live long enough
			to learn about us.
			He's not very attractive, but
			I will have him.
			They are inquisitive. They would
			like to know how you would endure.
			Endure what?
			Them.
			One or both?
			It is confirmed that the organisms
			feed on some of the compounds that
			make up the Enterprise hull.
			And the Klingon ship, the Pagh?
			They are much more susceptible.
			Their hull contains all of the
			compounds.
			Project your calculations.
			According to the rate of
			reproduction there should be a
			twelve centimeter hole in the
			Klingon hull at this time.
			Signal them at once and advise
			them. Change our course to
			attempt an intercept. We will
			make every attempt to cleanse the
			vessel and assist with repairs.
			It will take some time to locate
			them. They are on undesignated
			maneuvers in the Pheben solar
			system.
			Then start immediately. Alert
			Engineering of this situation.
			Ensign Crusher, adjust course
			toward the proper sector.
			Aye sir. Shall we prepare for
			warp speed?
			Yes...
			... and hope that we get there
			in time.
			Commander Riker to the bridge.
			On monitor. Tell me Commander
			Riker, what do you make of this?
			I felt no collision. Were we hit
			by a small meteor?
			There was no collision.
			Corrosion then.
			No, not corrosion.
			Science Station, analyze.
			We already have and fortunately
			the cavity opened into a section
			that could withstand the change
			in pressure.
			Then what is it?
			A space organism eating away at
			our hull. Our estimate is that
			in less than eight hours we will
			have lost too much of our shell
			to remain intact.
			You must have a way to repair
			it.
			I'm afraid not.
			There has to be. Where did this
			come from?
			"Where" might be the answer.
			The only contact we had was with
			the Enterprise.
			There was no direct contact with
			the Enterprise.
			Tactics Officer, report to
			Commander Riker.
			The Enterprise did conduct an
			intensive scan of this vessel.
			It's normal procedure.
			What type of beam did the
			Enterprise use to create this
			damage in our hull?
			None! Why would they do that?
			We are allies.
			My logs indicate that the
			Enterprise directed an intense
			scanning beam at this specific
			area for a duration of two
			minutes.
			Explain that.
			I can't.
			It could be a weapon.
			Wait a minute. Why? There's
			no new weapon. The Enterprise
			has no reason to do this,
			especially not with me on board.
			It makes no sense.
			"Why" is no longer important.
			What is important is our response
			to this attack.
			Engage cloaking device. Change
			course to intercept the
			Enterprise.
			Captain, what do you intend to
			do?
			Intend? There is only one
			response. We intend to attack
			the Enterprise and destroy it!!
			You seem to be making progress.
			You've already eliminated half
			the possibilities.
			Thank you, but I seem to have
			become efficient a little later
			than was needed. It was my
			responsibility to learn and adapt
			to the Enterprise's regulations.
			I didn't do that.
			Not really, it was an error.
			Captain Picard may not like them,
			but he does know they can happen
			from time to time.
			I failed, I had an opportunity
			to show the captain my superior
			abilities and I failed. I can
			never recover from that.
			It was a mistake... That's all.
			You didn't put the organism on
			the hull. You discovered it and
			you were attempting to analyze
			it. All you did was mess up a
			little on the ship's protocol.
			I know you're trying to be nice
			to me and I appreciate it. What
			I don't understand is why?
			Why not? I thought you could use
			a friend.
			Thank you. I only hope I can
			learn your ways before I "mess" up
			again. I imagine my methods seem
			foolish to you.
			They are different. But that's
			what this exchange program is all
			about... You learn the way we
			do things and bring that
			information back to your command.
			It's up to you to decide which
			way is better for you.
			It's easy. All you have to do
			is learn.
			You're right. I'll try your
			way...
			I'll work even harder than before.
			I'll succeed brilliantly.
			What is the status?
			Unchanged. The rate of increase
			continues.
			Commander Riker, check the
			organism growth with Engineering.
			Keep him under scrutiny. I'm
			not sure I trust him.
			I'm not totally convinced that
			Riker knew of any plot against
			us. If he did then why would he
			have come on board?
			Because he was ordered to.
			To die?
			To be ordered to die is an
			expectation for any officer at
			any time.
			For a Klingon perhaps, but Riker's
			people do not volunteer for death
			so easily. Even so, Riker may
			be a spy, but he's no coward.
			That only proves that he is
			intelligent and that you may not
			be as strong as you used to be.
			Captain, we have picked up the
			Enterprise.
			So soon?
			The Enterprise is on an intercept
			course with us.
			You almost had me believing that
			perhaps this was a
			misunderstanding.
			Yes... So?
			The Enterprise has changed course
			and is following us. Why?
			I don't know. Let's ask them.
			The reason is obvious. Their
			intent is clear. How long before
			we have contact?
			Less than fifteen minutes, sir.
			Put the ship on battle alert.
			Arm all photon torpedoes and put
			phasers on full power. Let them
			charge into their destruction.
			Sir, bearings show that we should
			be in contact with the Klingon
			ship.
			Slow to impulse speed. Continue
			on course.
			Aye sir, impulse speed.
			Hailing frequencies open. There
			is no response.
			Continue to transmit.
			The Pagh is either destroyed or
			cloaked.
			Begin intensive scan for debris.
			Conduct a thorough search of the
			area.
			The Enterprise has slowed to
			impulse speed and is making an
			intensive sweep.
			Hold your position. Let them come
			to us.
			They may be here to help you...
			Don't be a fool!
			Do not forget my rank.
			I haven't. I am simply trying
			to get you to understand.
			I fully understand... Now you
			understand.
			I am still the captain of this
			vessel and you are still crew and
			sworn to obey me. You gave me
			your oath.
			Yes sir, I did.
			Then fulfill that oath and serve
			this ship as you swore to.
			Tell me of the surest method of
			attack against the Enterprise.
			I can't.
			You must tell me. It is a matter
			of honor and loyalty.
			I cannot surrender the secrets
			of Starfleet and the Enterprise
			to you.
			Then if your word is no good, how
			can we trust any of your people?
			I won't break any vow I took in
			the past. I also swore a loyalty
			to your ship and I will keep that.
			They are in conflict!
			No sir, they are not! I will obey
			your orders. I will serve this
			ship as first officer, and in an
			attack against the Enterprise I
			will die along with this crew...
			but I will not dishonor my oath
			to the Enterprise.
			If you had agreed to disclose
			those facts about the Enterprise
			I would have labelled you a
			traitor and killed you on the
			spot...
			Instead you will die with us.
			You will die like a Klingon.
			So be it.
			Sir, I have something to report
			to you immediately.
			Go ahead, Ensign.
			I have managed to isolate the
			organism on our hull.
			Spare me the technical details...
			just the results.
			They are of a sub-micron form.
			They are controllable and can
			be removed from the hulls of both
			ships.
			Thank you Ensign, well done.
			Prepare whatever procedures are
			necessary.
			Lieutenant Worf, add this
			information to hailing messages.
			Aye sir. Still no response.
			The Enterprise has changed hailing
			messages. They now include a
			promise of cleaning the organisms
			and assisting in repairs.
			They mean it... They will help.
			And I mean what I say.
			Arm all weapons... Prepare for
			attack...
			Captain's log, supplemental,
			Stardate 42608.2. Although our
			search has been extensive, we are
			still unable to locate the
			Klingon ship or any debris. The
			absence of both leaves us puzzled
			and somewhat tentative.
			Considering the absence of debris,
			it is reasonable to assume the
			Klingon vessel is in the vicinity
			and cloaked.
			Agreed.
			Since we do not know their intent
			I recommend we go to Red Alert.
			Make it so.
			The Enterprise has raised its
			shields.
			It is normal procedure when
			entering into a suspicious
			situation. The act is not
			aggressive. The Enterprise will
			not fire first.
			Then they are fools, for we will.
			You'll get only one shot.
			We will only need one. Arm all
			phasers and torpedoes. Prepare
			to fire them simultaneously.
			Then I recommend you do not fire
			until you are within forty
			thousand kilometers.
			Why?
			It will reduce their response
			time.
			You are honoring your promise to
			serve us.
			Would you do less?
			No.
			You will give the order to fire,
			Commander Riker.
			Call out distances.
			Any questions, Mister Riker?
			Just something I have to say...
			... I dispute your judgment. Your
			reasons for forcing this
			confrontation are not valid.
			Are you finished?
			Yes sir.
			Then commence with attack as
			ordered.
			Fifty-five thousand kilometers
			and closing.
			Is that a weapon?
			No sir, it is a signaling device.
			Hand it to me, Commander.
			We are getting an emergency signal
			from a command transponder.
			Location nine-three-five mark
			six-one-three... Frequency
			and code designate it as Commander
			Riker.
			Chief O'Brien, align with
			emergency transponder signal.
			Yes Captain. We are not yet in
			safe range for a transfer and
			defensive shields are still in
			place.
			We may have to stretch it a
			little. On my command.
			Forty-eight thousand.
			Lieutenant Worf to the Transporter
			Room. Doctor Pulaski will
			accompany you. Mendon take over
			the count.
			Yes sir. Forty-five thousand and
			still closing.
			Forty-four thousand.
			Transporter Room, ready. You will
			control defensive shields...
			Ready sir.
			Forty thousand...
			Forty thousand.
			Prepare to drop cloaking shields
			and fire. Steady...
			Transporter Room, energize.
			Hold where you are Klag. I have
			relieved Captain Kargan. He was
			acting in an irrational manner.
			I am now your captain!!
			Serve this ship as I have!
			Defensive shields back in place.
			Who are you?
			I am Lieutenant Worf of the
			Starship Enterprise.
			Riker has no honor... He tricked
			me!!
			He's barely stunned.
			Of course, he is a Klingon
			captain.
			That's great, but where's Will
			Riker?
			Cloaking shields off.
			Obey my orders.
			We will be destroyed.
			If we are, it will be in battle
			and I will die with you.
			Now, cloaking shields off!
			It is the Pagh sir. It has all
			armament locked on us and ready
			to fire.
			Hold position. Hailing
			frequencies open.
			Calling the Pagh. This is the
			Enterprise. We are here to assist
			you. Do not fire.
			They will not believe you.
			Pagh... Do you read me??
			Enterprise, this is Captain
			William Riker of the Klingon
			vessel, the Pagh.
			I order you to lower your shields
			and surrender.
			Lower shields.
			Surrender as ordered.
			I demand to be beamed back aboard
			my vessel.
			Transporter Chief, prepare to beam
			Captain Kargan aboard the Pagh.
			Captain Riker, preparations are
			ready for immediate repairs to
			your ship.
			Thank you, Captain Picard.
			You should have killed me.
			I don't want your command.
			You tricked me so you could have
			it.
			And I give it back to you now.
			Then return to your position.
			No more, Captain Kargan...
			Get him off my ship!
			Yes, Captain.
			You understand the Klingons better
			than I thought.
			Thank you, my friend.
			That might be one of the shortest
			assignments in the history of
			Starfleet.
			You're wrong, Number One... it
			was almost the longest.
			You did well.
			Thank you. I learned quite a bit.
			Apparently not how to duck.
			When not to duck would be more
			accurate.
			If that was the intention...
			Welcome aboard.
			Thank you. Your little toy
			worked.
			I'm glad it did, sir.
			You come from a very brave and
			unique race. I'm glad you're here
			on the Enterprise.
			Thank you, Commander...
			... and welcome home.
