			Captain's log, Stardate 42881.5.
			We are in orbit around Antede
			Three, awaiting the arrival of
			two dignitaries from this world.
			Our mission is to carry them to
			a conference on planet Pacifica...
			... where their race will be given
			the opportunity to join the
			Federation.
			I thought you might find this
			interesting, Mister Crusher. Few
			humans have ever seen an Antedian
			in the flesh.
			Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard,
			captain of the Enterprise.
			Are they alright, Captain?
			No, this is their preferred way
			of space travel.
			Their physical condition appears
			good enough, considering the
			circumstances.
			It is a self-induced catatonic
			state. Their way of dealing with
			the trauma of spaceflight.
			Will we try to revive them?
			Not until we reach the Pacifica
			conference. It's three days away.
			You've prepared Sickbay facilities
			for holding them, Doctor?
			As soon as we make some
			adjustments. Their physiology
			is unusual.
			Can you store them for a few
			hours?
			Aye. I'll have them kept out of
			the way here.
			What's in this container?
			Their food. When they come out
			of stasis, they will be very
			hungry.
			This is what they eat?
			In great quantities.
			Provide security.
			Understood, sir.
			What a handsome race.
			What did you think of the
			Antedians, Wesley?
			Well, they are rather
			strange-looking, Commander.
			Judging a being by its physical
			appearance is the last great human
			prejudice, Wesley.
			A point well taken. I'm sure
			that to the Antedians, we're
			equally unattractive.
			It is interesting to consider just
			how subjective "beauty" truly
			is...
			Captain... we're being hailed by
			a small transport vessel just
			coming into range.
			Oh, my God!
			What is the problem?
			What can she be doing here?
			On the screen, Captain.
			Starship Enterprise, come in!
			We have you on our viewer, Pilot.
			Enterprise... I have a passenger
			-- a V.I.P. passenger -- who I'm
			ordered to --
			Let me talk to them, Pilot. I'm
			much more articulate.
			Mother!
			Captain, we are now receiving
			Starfleet orders granting a
			Lwaxana....
			Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the
			Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred
			Chalice of Riix, heir to the Holy
			Rings of Betazed.
			... full ambassadorial status,
			sir.
			I'm afraid it's back into your
			formal uniform, Captain.
			And yours too, Commander. She
			is listed as representing the
			Betazed government at the
			conference.
			Mother, please don't do this to
			me.
			Do what to you, Little One?
			Oh, what naughty thoughts,
			Jean-Luc. How wonderful you still
			think of me in that way.
			It's so like my mother to do the
			unexpected. She's famous for it.
			It will be nice to have her as
			a guest of the Enterprise again.
			Energize.
			Aaagh! Where are my legs?!
			Where they belong, Mother, Right
			under you.
			Oh, wonderful. So they are!
			But I'll never completely trust
			this device, Jean-Luc...
			He's "Captain Picard," Mother...
			Aaagh!
			Explain.
			Sorry they startled you, Mrs.
			Troi. These are Antedian
			delegates... ah, temporarily being
			stored here, I believe...
			"Delegates?" The last time I saw
			something like this, it was being
			served on a plate.
			But you, Jean-Luc, I was not aware
			you had such handsome legs. My
			valet is waiting. You may beam
			him aboard now.
			You remember Mister Homn, of course.
			It would be hard to forget Mister
			Homn. Welcome back to the
			Enterprise.
			I've retained his services despite
			the outlandishly lustful thoughts
			he spews in my direction. I
			suppose the poor fellow just can't
			help himself.
			Perhaps you could show me to my
			suite now?
			Certainly.
			Put that down, Homn. We can't
			deny the captain the honor of
			carrying my belongings.
			I won't interfere with Homn's
			duties this time.
			That's not the real reason,
			Jean-Luc. You forget I'm a
			telepath.
			Look, since this apparently has
			some meaning to you, Mrs. Troi,
			I'll...
			...carry...it.
			It's... just down this hall.
			He has nice legs too, Little One.
			Is he still yours?
			Humans no longer own each other
			that way, Mother.
			Oh really?
			That's a custom we may have to
			introduce again.
			Thank you.
			Glad I could help out.
			I trust you'll be comfortable
			here, Mrs. Troi. Now if you'll
			excuse me, I must get back to my
			duties.
			Captain, I will be serving a
			Betazoid dinner of greeting
			tonight. It is an ambassadorial
			function.
			Of course. It, uh, sounds
			delightful.
			He's a fine man. Solid. Earnest.
			Reliable. Perhaps a little on
			the dull side, but all in all he's
			not bad.
			I cannot believe you! You sound
			like you're sizing up a commodity.
			But that's exactly what men are,
			darling. Especially human men.
			Was your father ever unhappy with
			me?
			No, he worshipped you, Mother.
			But I'll never learn to see men
			the way you do.
			You will as you mature, darling.
			And the males in your life will
			bless you for it.
			... but it's true she complimented
			Captain Picard on his legs?
			I would have thought a telepath
			would be more discreet.
			No, it's just the opposite. She
			knows what's in your mind and she
			lets you know what's on hers.
			We must not lose sight of the fact
			that we're talking about someone
			who has been granted ambassadorial
			rank. Even if she appears a bit
			eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be
			treated with appropriate respect.
			Is that understood?
			Our orders on her mentioned
			nothing specific except...
			Except what, Mister Data?
			We are to cooperate with her as
			fully as possible, deliver her
			there untroubled, rested...
			I assume those were merely
			courtesies due her rank, sir.
			See that every bridge officer and
			supervisor has the full text of
			that transmission.
			Aye, sir.
			Picard to Pulaski. When was the
			last time you looked in on our
			Antedian guests?
			I'm doing so right now, Captain.
			Are they still catatonic?
			Status of the beings is unchanged.
			Pulse still steady -- respiration
			normal for them.
			Understood. Keep me informed --
			Picard out.
			I believe I'll get some rest.
			It will be a dress uniform dinner,
			gentlemen.
			Sir?
			Inquiry, Commander: to which
			dinner was the captain referring?
			Nothing I've been invited to.
			Have any of you?
			Very interesting!
			You're not attending the dinner
			with us this evening, Doctor?
			I've already eaten, Captain. But
			thanks anyway.
			Come in!
			Tell me Mister Homn, when will the
			others be arriving?
			The other officers?
			Commander Riker? Deanna?
			Hello, Jean-Luc. So glad you
			could come.
			A toast: to Earthmen... who
			despite their faults, have a
			unique ability to charm women of
			all races, in all corners of the
			galaxy.
			Speaking for the men of Earth,
			which is an awesome responsibility
			indeed, I thank you.
			I know what you're thinking,
			Captain.
			You do?
			You're wondering if I've been
			seeing any other man on a serious
			basis.
			Well actually I wasn't --
			-- I wouldn't worry about it,
			Jean-Luc.
			Competition seems to bring out
			the best in the human male.
			I must admit, I wasn't expecting
			this... setting. I assumed that
			my high-ranking officers would
			also be attending.
			Never assume anything when it
			comes to Lwaxana Troi. A Betazoid
			woman is full of surprises.
			Strange, I'm not that hungry
			tonight.
			I wonder what's making me lose
			my appetite? Any ideas?
			Oh yes, you're giving thanks for
			your food. I'd forgotten about
			that.
			I wonder how many other cultures
			have similar customs.
			I don't know.
			Let's find out.
			Commander Data.
			Yes, Captain.
			Mrs. Troi and I are having a very
			interesting discussion about the
			various ways by which societies
			give thanks. For instance, the
			Betazoids use of the chime.
			The use of the chime is unique,
			but not at all dissimilar to the
			Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who
			use two large stones which are
			continuously struck during the
			meal. Those at the dinner must
			eat until the stones are broken.
			Or, the oligarchy on Atifs Four,
			which require a young male to...
			Commander, this is absolutely
			fascinating, don't you agree, Mrs.
			Troi? Data, if your duties
			permit, why don't you join us for
			dessert?
			You are forgetting sir -- I do not
			digest foodstuffs, therefore I
			cannot participate in the
			consumption of your post-main
			course edibles.
			What'd he just say?
			You don't have to eat to join us,
			Commander. I'm sure Mrs. Troi
			would simply enjoy the pleasure
			of your company.
			Indeed, sir. I am on my way; Data
			out.
			How could you possibly think I'd
			want to share our special time
			together, with that robot of
			yours?
			Because... because of his
			wonderful after-dinner
			conversation. His anecdotes are
			the stuff of legends aboard this
			ship.
			-- So by using the square root
			of pi and then multiplying it by
			nine to the third power, I was
			able to accurately calculate the
			distance between the Omicron
			galaxy and the Crab Nebula.
			Fascinating, Data. I'm sure Mrs.
			Troi would love to hear the one
			about the, uh, anomalous chemical
			composition of... say... brown
			dwarf stars.
			Well, not really --
			-- Yes Captain, that is a
			particularly spellbinding subject.
			For most stars, the rare-Earth
			element Europium is enriched
			relative to samarium and
			gadolinium...
			Is that so?
			It is! However in brown dwarf
			stars, the element Europium is
			anomalously depleted.
			Fascinating.
			But that is only the beginning.
			If the abundances of the elements
			terbium, dysprosium, holmium and
			erbium are also factored into the
			analysis...
			Your mother seems quite an
			interesting woman, Deanna.
			Doctor, perhaps I should tell you
			something about my mother's
			condition at this time.
			Condition at this time?!
			Something that occurs to Betazoid
			females at mid-life. We call it
			the Phase.
			At mid-life as in the human
			female's menopause?
			Almost the exact opposite. It
			is only at mid-life that Betazed
			females become... well, fully
			sexual, if you know what I mean.
			Yes, perhaps I do. I just heard
			her voice fairly singing when she
			called the captain into her room.
			I wonder if I shouldn't warn the
			captain?
			Nooo. As ship's doctor I'd
			consider it excellent exercise
			for his reflexes and agility.
			Doctor... !
			In staying ahead of your mother.
			Yes. An animal is always at its
			best when hunted...
			Or when hunting.
			... and at this point, the second
			co-orbital satellite avoids a
			collision with the first.
			-- Deanna, darling! Thank the
			Four Dieties you're here.
			I hope I'm not interrupting.
			No, as a matter of fact, I need
			to get back to the bridge myself.
			Perhaps I should stay here and
			further entertain our guest.
			-- No! I mean, I think you're
			needed on the bridge as well.
			Thank you for a delicious meal.
			Let's uh, do it again sometime.
			Oh, I know we will.
			Little One, the captain is every
			bit as charming as your father
			was.
			Data, you'll never know just how
			much I owe you for that.
			Indeed, Captain? I know many more
			interesting anecdotes as well.
			Status of the Antedian delegates
			unchanged, Captain.
			What's our e.t.a. to the
			conference?
			Forty five point three hours, sir.
			Very good, Number One. I'll be
			in my Ready Room.
			Why would you come aboard at a
			time like this?
			I had no choice. I was going
			to Pacifica, you were going to
			Pacifica, it seemed the
			appropriate thing to do.
			Don't be absurd -- you knew what
			this would lead to...
			What stage is it in?
			I have it completely under
			control.
			What stage is it in?
			Well, far enough along for me to
			enjoy it, Little One.
			Now I know why you wore that
			dress.
			Don't be ridiculous. It's just
			a simple little dress -- there's
			nothing provocative about it.
			What are we going to do?
			I'm going to do the only honorable
			thing there is to do.
			And I'd say the captain has the
			inside track.
			Don't even think it!
			Why not? He was thinking about
			it all through dinner.
			I was what?!
			I tell you Deanna, for a telepath,
			your mother's accuracy leaves much
			to be desired.
			Actually, her telepathic prowess
			is quite advanced. Except for
			now.
			"Except for now?"
			Don't misunderstand me, Counselor.
			Your mother is a beautiful
			person...
			My mother is just beginning a
			physiological phase... one that
			all Betazoid women must deal with
			as they enter mid-life.
			It's something Troi warned me
			about when we were first seeing
			each other.
			When a Betazoid female goes
			through "the Phase," it quadruples
			her sex drive.
			Or more...
			... "or more?" I didn't know
			that.
			I didn't want to frighten you.
			My mother has opted for the only
			dignified course of action open
			to her.
			Isolation?
			She has chosen to focus all of
			her sexual energy on one male.
			This man will eventually become
			her husband, of course.
			It seems Captain, that you are
			the early favorite.
			Congratulations, sir!
			I am not amused, Number One.
			There must be a way to convince
			her that it's quite impossible
			-- without offending her.
			You cannot apply human style logic
			to this, Captain.
			Mother would be shocked and deeply
			resentful, should you spurn her
			advances. She would naturally
			take it very personally.
			Well, considering Starfleet's
			orders not to get her upset, I
			think it might be prudent for me
			to make myself less available for
			the duration of this journey.
			Agreed.
			Setting: San Francisco
			California, United States Of
			America, the year 1945 A.D.,
			program to fit the novel, "The
			Long Dark Tunnel".
			You may enter when ready.
			Dixon Hill's memoirs: date, the
			1940's...
			It was a grey day in the city by
			the bay. My pockets were as empty
			as a press agent's heart. I
			needed a case, that's for sure,
			but the private dick racket was
			as slow as the horse I just blew
			my last two bucks on.
			Hello, it's good to see you again.
			You're too much, Dix. You make
			it sound like you ain't seen me
			in a year.
			You got two calls...
			New cases?
			Are you kiddin'? The last time
			we got a new case, Hitler wasn't
			running Germany.
			Your tailor called -- he wants
			his dough for cleaning your other
			suit -- and your landlord called -- you
			can guess what he wants.
			I see... Well, pay the tailor and
			stall the landlord.
			Pay the tailor...
			Pay the tailor? With what?
			Unavailable? Ship's business?
			Ship's business takes precedence
			over me?
			I'm afraid so.
			Hmmm... Oh well, he was too old
			for me anyway.
			Homn, let's consider my alternate
			plan.
			Alternate plan?
			You worry too much, Little One.
			Your mother has the situation well
			in hand.
			There's a gentleman here to see
			you, Mister Hill.
			Thank you, Madeline.
			Yes, as the book said, everything
			about you is big: big
			shoulders... big neck... big
			fists...
			You a private dick?
			Says so on my door, doesn't it?
			I want you should do a job for
			me.
			Let me guess -- you want dance
			lessons.
			You're not trying to be funny are
			you? I don't like funny things.
			Yes... yes, I understand that.
			No funny things.
			I want you to find a missing
			person.
			Alva? Let's see -- I'll bet she's
			your sister...
			Yes. She's my sister, and I want
			you to find her!
			Take it easy, Mac! I can't take
			the job of finding Alva if you
			break me like a matchstick.
			As a matter of fact, I knew who
			Alva was all along. I've read
			the book.
			Read what book? Are you being
			funny again?
			You got a picture?
			Of Alva?
			Of course of Alva! The novel
			wasn't illustrated.
			I believe the 1940 expression was
			"hubbah, hubbah, hubbah."
			And I still say you talk funny.
			I don't like funny talk.
			That's part of the cost of hiring
			a private eye like me, Slade.
			I'm very different from most you
			could get.
			I want you to find Alva. I'll
			pay you.
			Okay. I'll find Alva for you;
			but you might not like what I
			find.
			This is so much fun.
			Even in this state, they possess
			a certain dignity, a graceful
			countenance.
			If you say so, Lieutenant.
			I see. Is this how you felt when
			you first saw me?
			Well... maybe at first.
			But now that I've seen a few more
			Klingons, I know that you're real
			handsome, for... for a Klingon.
			That uh, didn't come out quite
			right.
			I still say they'd look better
			in sauce.
			No, nothing.
			When will the good captain revive
			them?
			Not until we reach Pacifica,
			ma'am.
			You seem a fine boy. One day you
			will grow up to be a big, strong
			man.
			But even though humans age far
			more rapidly than Betazoids, I
			cannot afford to wait for you to
			mature.
			But you... your innermost thoughts
			are primal, savage. I like that
			in a man.
			I am not a man.
			Which is in your favor, men so
			often being irrational and
			egotistical.
			But I'm afraid I've grown
			accustomed to human companionship.
			It's nothing personal, you would
			have made a fine choice.
			Who's next, Mister Homn?
			Ah yes. Let's get to it, I'm not
			getting any younger.
			What was that all about?
			Lieutenant La Forge, I wish to
			be direct with you.
			I prefer it that way. Now what
			are you being direct about?
			I have decided to give all the
			bridge officers an equal
			opportunity to gain my favor.
			I see.
			Ah, but you don't, and that's the
			problem. I wonder whether a
			sightless man could ever
			appreciate great beauty.
			That's funny... I've always had
			the same doubts about the sighted.
			Odd. How so?
			Because my eyes don't seduce my
			mind, I'm driven to find beauty
			in other things -- things sighted
			people tend to ignore. The lovely
			temperature gradiations of bodies,
			the moisture patterns, the
			indications of inner peace and
			harmony...
			Very interesting, Lieutenant. But
			I'm not sure if that's good or
			bad. A less perceptive man could
			be easier to live with.
			Twenty dollars a day, plus
			expenses. Fifty when I find her.
			You know it's wonderful to need
			money.
			You'll get more when you find
			Alva.
			Let's see... I must have been
			skimming pages about here. What
			part did you play?
			Freeze.
			Ah, yes, of course.
			I'm looking for Slade Bender,
			Hill. I understand he was here
			yesterday.
			My, my, time does fly in the
			Holodeck.
			Even if I happen to know a Slade
			Bender, why should I help you?
			Because he owes me money. And
			because if you don't, I'll blow
			your head off.
			I knew you'd say something like
			that. Marvelous.
			Cut the crap, Hill! Tell me where
			he is or so help me, I'll plug
			ya!
			I don't think so.
			Come on, drop! I shot ya.
			No, the gun misfired. Thankfully
			the Holodeck is handling it
			correctly and the mortality
			failsafe is functional.
			But in some ways, the program is
			almost too accurate.
			Dixon, you're hurt!
			Don't worry about it.
			I'm going out for a drink.
			Well hello, Dixon. Haven't seen
			you in a while.
			What's it been, four hours?
			You must be Rex. Am I right?
			If you gotta ask me that pal, you
			need a drink.
			You're right, I do need a drink.
			The usual?
			Let's see... Scotch, neat?
			What else?
			I hate to be the bearer of bad
			news old buddy, but you're leakin'
			blood.
			So? I've got plenty more where
			that came from.
			Geez, Dix. You're tough as
			nails.
			Uggh, I'm going to have to get
			used to that.
			Yeah, it's only your third one
			today.
			What the hell... make it four.
			I'll put it on your tab.
			Cash! I just took on a case.
			Bridge this is Doctor Pulaski.
			We have completed the transfer.
			The Antedians are now in Sickbay.
			Acknowledged, Doctor.
			E.t.a. to Pacifica, Mister Crusher?
			Twelve point four hours, sir.
			That will get us there
			approximately two hours before
			the conference begins.
			Mother, what are you doing here?
			You can't just stroll up to the
			bridge whenever you feel like it.
			I didn't just stroll up, dear.
			I took the turbotube, or whatever
			you call it.
			The captain's not here?
			He's busy elsewhere, ma'am.
			Well, no matter. I have other
			interests as well.
			You're scheming something, Mother.
			I can tell.
			You're always so melodramatic,
			Little One. I'm not scheming,
			I'm deciding.
			Tell me Commander... what is your
			opinion of Betazoid women?
			Well... I've only your daughter
			and you. But judging from that,
			I'd have to say they're the
			fairest in the galaxy.
			He has excellent taste, Little
			One.
			That's enough! This is getting
			embarrassing.
			My lovely daughter has always
			found it difficult to accept
			compliments from male admirers.
			I however, long ago learned to
			accept them.
			The key is learning how to endure
			constant flattery without letting
			it go to your head. Don't you
			agree, Commander?
			If you say so, ma'am.
			I like that answer! Now here's
			a man who knows how to defer to
			a lady. I only hope the rest of
			you men are listening.
			... So she says "Rex, when are
			you gonna sell the bar and get
			a real job? Make a shoe, mend
			a fence, do something useful?"
			Can you believe that, Dix?
			It's hard to believe, Rex.
			She just doesn't understand the
			service I perform here. My
			regulars depend on me to pour and
			listen, listen and pour. I'm like
			some kind'a psychologist to you
			guys, am I right?
			I recognize the size of the
			shadow.
			Hello Slade. Buy you a drink?
			Where's my Alva?
			I'm working on it.
			You're not working hard enough.
			Hey pal, that's my buddy you're
			manhandling there! Maybe you
			oughta --
			-- Oughta go right ahead with what
			you were saying.
			I paid you money, Hill. Where
			is she?
			The blood chemistry and brain
			organization of these creatures
			is completely outside of my
			experience... But it seems their
			metabolic rates are increasing.
			Is that good or bad?
			It's good, I think.
			Pulaski to bridge.
			Riker here.
			The Antedians are coming around.
			They're currently in the early
			stages of post-hibernation.
			How long before they're fully
			conscious?
			I'd guess it to be a matter of
			hours now.
			Very good, Doctor, I'll notify
			the captain. Riker out.
			If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
			Are you going to see the captain?
			I thought he was tied up on
			ship's business.
			In a manner of speaking... he is.
			I'm uh, not going to interrupt
			him, I'm simply going to inform
			him.
			What excellent timing! You can
			also inform him about us.
			Us?
			You don't mind if I let your
			bridge crew know first, do you
			William?
			Dear friends... you're all invited
			to a prestigious occasion on the
			planet Pacifica.
			Oh no.
			There, on the shores of the
			western sea... in a traditional
			Betazoid ceremony... your
			Commander Riker and I will be
			joined in the union of holy
			wedlock.
			Married?
			'Till death do us part.
			Mrs. Troi... I don't know how to
			put this --
			-- I know just how you feel, dear.
			Overwhelmed with excitement.
			Believe me, I understand.
			We'll talk about the details
			later. Right now, there are
			preparations to be made.
			Why did you stop me? Someone
			needs to set her straight!
			I'd rather let the captain handle
			that.
			Coward!
			Simply following Starfleet's
			orders. Keep her mind untroubled
			until the conference.
			Are you planing on going into the
			Holodeck, Commander?
			Thought I might, Data. Want to
			come along?
			I have mastered the language, or
			"lingo" of the period, sir. Also,
			the mannerisms and body language.
			For example, this is a gesture
			denoting confidence and physical
			prowess. It is effective in
			attracting females and frightening
			off would-be adversaries.
			Should anything in there confuse
			you sir, do not hesitate to ask.
			It's comforting to know I'm with
			an expert Data, but we're really
			not going to be there that long.
			Computer...
			She could be anywhere, Slade.
			You can't expect me to find her
			in one afternoon.
			It's been three days.
			Has it really? What I mean is
			-- you gotta have patience. I'll
			find her; I guarantee it.
			She'd contact me if she knew I
			was lookin' for her.
			Come on, pal! So she told you
			that? So what? If I had a dime
			for every time a dame's said that
			to a guy --
			-- I'd... probably have less than
			a dollar. Cuz a girl never says
			that unless she really means it.
			See? I want you to find my
			sister!
			In the last program here, we said
			I was from South America. It
			seemed to explain my unorthodox
			appearance.
			Easy Slade. They're friends of
			mine.
			Sorry to bother you, Captain.
			-- Call me Dixon.
			-- Sorry to bother you, Dixon,
			but our two "passengers" are
			awakening.
			Well then, it's time to go.
			Your friends've got time for one
			drink, haven't they Dix?
			Sure, I can afford another round.
			Very accurate. Fascinating.
			These are my associates...
			"Nails", from Chicago.
			And --
			Carlos, from South America.
			Sit right down fellas, and tell
			me your troubles.
			Troubles I've got, sir. There's
			a certain woman, a wealthy and
			beautiful woman, who suddenly says
			she's going to marry me.
			She's got looks and bucks? Sounds
			like you've got yourself a heck
			of a deal.
			My fiance just has to see how I
			look in this. Come along, Homn.
			Tell me, computer, is Commander
			Riker still on the bridge?
			Negative. Riker is currently in
			Holodeck Three.
			Holodeck? Where is that?
			Follow the com panel lights. They
			will lead you there.
			Good God, what's that?
			I'll bet that's the broad with
			the big bucks!
			Come on over here, darlin'. I
			got the best stool in the house
			saved for ya.
			I'm surprised you let this part
			of the ship get this dirty.
			Actually, that's the first
			officer's job.
			Well, as a matter of fact...
			Relax, Commander. You have begun
			making your true feelings clear.
			Obviously you feel unable to
			handle me.
			Anyway, why would a beautiful
			high-class lady like yourself...
			... want to hook up with a mug like
			that? You're too good for him,
			if you ask me.
			I couldn't agree more.
			So... what'llitbe, Doll?
			You are a most interesting person.
			You're not so bad yourself. In
			fact, you're as much class as this
			joint's ever seen.
			Here -- on the house. It's
			French... well, almost.
			This is the most remarkable man.
			I have never met anyone quite
			like him.
			I don't suppose you have.
			He's strong. I feel no thoughts
			from him... nothing. I've never
			known a man so able to keep his
			true feelings completely hidden.
			That's because...
			No man has ever been such a
			mystery to me. I usually know
			their thoughts before they do.
			But not me, huh?
			No. And I never realized how
			erotic that could be. Carry my
			beverage to that table... we have
			some things to talk about.
			Should we tell her?
			I think it's only fair, but let's
			allow her the moment.
			Food-food-food-food-food--
			Worf! The vermicula!
			Pulaski to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			Our passengers are on their feet.
			Understood.
			I had better get to the bridge.
			What's their condition?
			Hungry.
			Coming, Mrs. Troi?
			Not just yet. Tell William I'm
			sorry... but Rex and I are
			getting married.
			Mrs. Troi, your government expects
			us to deliver you to the
			conference and I intend to do
			that!
			Duty calls, darling. I'll be back
			for you later.
			There is something about Rex I
			think you had better know...
			Imagine -- allowing me to go on
			like that with a simple bartender
			who doesn't even exist!
			Mother, you always say you like
			new experiences.
			Why are they still here?
			We thought that since you're going
			to the same conference, you might
			like to beam down with the other
			delegates.
			They're not delegates. Those two
			are assassins.
			That is... an outrage!... Lies!
			We demand you... transport at
			once!
			Oh honey, don't bother to deny
			it. Your minds are so
			unsophisticated -- I can read your
			thoughts in my sleep.
			The inside of their robes are
			lined with ultritium. Highly
			explosive and virtually
			undetectable by your transporter.
			She is correct, sir. I am
			detecting large amounts of
			ultritium.
			Of course you are. They planned
			to blow up the entire conference.
			Take them to level five. Disarm
			them and hold for questioning.
			Oh well, I didn't find a mate but
			I saved the conference as well
			as your reputations. All in a
			day's work I suppose.
			Good-bye Mrs. Troi... and thank
			you.
			Jean-Luc! Shame on you for
			thinking such a thing!
