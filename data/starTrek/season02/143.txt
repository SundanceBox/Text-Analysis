			Captain's log, Stardate 42723.8.
			The Enterprise is en route to the
			Epsilon Nine Sector for
			astronomical survey of a new
			pulsar cluster. In the meantime,
			Ensign Crusher will be diverting
			to Starbase five one five for
			progressive Starfleet exams...
			This just came in from Starfleet--
			The testing parameters?
			Do not be apprehensive. I found
			the Academy examinations quite
			elementary.
			You would.
			Your earlier test results were
			good enough to get you Academy
			credit for your work here. I
			don't think you have anything to
			worry about.
			But those Academy cadets are
			pretty competitive, you know.
			They don't have your practical
			experience, Wes.
			Commander Riker is correct. While
			the information imparted to cadets
			at the Academy is unquestionably
			vital for prospective Starfleet
			officers, it nevertheless requires
			a significant period of
			supplementary systems training
			and situational disciplines.
			Data... isn't that what I just
			said?
			Yes, Commander. But not quite
			as perspicuously.
			I won't have you telling me what
			course to set!
			As chief medical officer, I am
			ordering you to report to Starbase
			five one five immediately!
			Oh, please. I feel fine.
			The truth is, you've neglected
			this far too long.
			This ship has a mission to carry
			out.
			An astronomical survey to be
			conducted by the science officers,
			I believe.
			I've been looking forward to
			seeing the Epsilon Pulsar Cluster
			for myself.
			Then we'll perform the procedure
			right here.
			Absolutely not.
			My staff and I are perfectly
			capable of giving you the
			replacement.
			That's not the point. Not only
			am I in splendid health, but it
			would be inappropriate for you
			to perform the procedure.
			Why Captain Picard, I had no idea.
			You do have an ego, don't you?
			Clarify.
			You're concerned about your image.
			I never said that.
			Don't worry. Get yourself down
			to Starbase five one five and your
			image will be safe with me.
			Captain... excuse me.
			I understand you're heading for
			Starbase five one five.
			Yes, sir. I was just on my way
			to Shuttle Bay Two.
			Good. I have some business of
			my own there. I shall accompany.
			you.
			You will?
			I mean, yessir!
			Prepare the shuttle for immediate
			departure.
			Aye, sir.
			Is there something I can take care
			of for you at Starbase
			five one five?
			I'm afraid not, Number One.
			But you'll miss the Epsilon Pulsar
			survey.
			I'm very well aware of that. You
			have the bridge. Carry on.
			What is it, Number One?
			Is something wrong? This trip
			to Starbase five one five seems
			rather unexpected.
			Not to worry. Ensign Crusher and
			I will rendezvous with you on your
			return from the Epsilon Pulsar
			Cluster.
			Forgive my saying so, sir, but
			you're being rather enigmatic.
			Consider it captain's privilege.
			As first officer, I have complete
			security clearance--
			This has nothing to do with ship's
			business.
			Suffice it to say that this is
			strictly a matter of ...vanity.
			Starbase five one five's not
			exactly around the corner, Wes.
			You have quite a trip ahead of
			you.
			Yeah. I know.
			Relax. You'll do fine on your
			exams.
			It's not the exams I'm worried
			about. It's Captain Picard.
			Why? He's not taking the exams.
			He's coming with me to starbase.
			Just the two of us. Nearly a
			six-hour transit. What am I going
			to talk to him about for six
			hours?
			Archaeology...semantics...
			literature... art... you can learn
			a lot from Captain Picard.
			Nice day for a little trip,
			Captain?
			Hardly.
			Shuttle Number Two ready for
			departure.
			We are at impulse speed and you
			are cleared for departure.
			Data... wasn't the captain looking
			forward to this mission to the
			Epsilon Pulsar Cluster?
			So he had said.
			Then what would make him change
			his mind? Why would he leave the
			ship now?
			Receiving a Mayday on all
			frequencies, sir!
			Source?
			Rhomboid Dronegar Sector
			zero-zero-six--
			Detail.
			Ship...unidentified...distress.
			Nothing more.
			Set course for Rhomboid Dronegar
			zero-zero-six at warp seven.
			Sir... Rhomboid Dronegar sector
			will put us at considerable
			distance from Captain Picard.
			I know, Data. I know.
			Entering Rhomboid Dronegar Sector
			zero-zero-six.
			I have a ship on target path.
			Slow to impulse speed.
			Viewer.
			Deploy shields, sir?
			Hold fast.
			Data?
			Basic early design capable of
			sub-light travel only.
			Commander, we are being hailed.
			On screen.
			I am First Officer William Riker.
			This is the USS Enterprise,
			responding to your distress
			signal--
			Uh-hunh.
			What is your problem?
			We are far from home.
			So are we, but you sent out a
			Mayday--
			Uh-hunh
			Do you need help?
			We are Pakleds. Our ship is the
			Mondor.
			It is broken.
			Sensors indicate engineering
			problems.
			Lieutentant La Forge to bridge...
			They have experienced total
			guidance system failure and they
			have less than twenty-four hours' reserve
			power.
			What brings you so far from home?
			We look for things.
			What were you looking for?
			Things we need.
			Can you be more specific?
			Uh-hunh.
			Then please do so.
			Things that make us go. We need
			help.
			Let me guess: their rubber band
			broke, right?
			What is the nature of your
			mission?
			We look for things.
			Do you hear an echo?
			Understood. Our chief engineer
			will beam aboard to help you--
			Out.
			Wait a minute... me?
			Do we truly need to send our chief
			engineer over to them?
			They obviously need our help.
			Why do we not simply give them
			the information they need to make
			their repairs?
			Do you honestly think they could
			handle our technical
			specifications?
			We don't know that much about
			them. I urge caution.
			Acknowledged, Worf... but we have
			an obligation to render aid.
			Report to the Transporter Room
			with all necessary gear.
			Aye, sir.
			We need more information.
			Do you have anything else on them?
			They are a relatively benign
			species.
			Don't they seem a little... slow?
			They may merely have
			poorly-developed language skills.
			What about weapons?
			Our scan shows very limited
			armaments.
			I think we can relax, Worf. They
			can't even get their ship moving
			without our help, and we certainly
			have them outmanned and outgunned.
			E.t.a. thirteen-thirty hours.
			Not exactly warp speed, sir.
			More like a late twenty-second century
			interplanetary journey.
			Sir?
			You should read more history,
			Ensign.
			Yes sir.
			Complete waste of time...
			Pardon, sir?
			I shouldn't be taking this trip
			at all. I belong back on the
			Enterprise.
			Why are you going with me to
			Starbase five one five, Captain?
			It's certainly not my idea!
			I'm sorry. I don't mean to take
			it out on you.
			I just hate going through another
			damned cardiac replacement.
			Cardiac replacement? I didn't
			know...
			Now you do.
			A parthenogenetic implant?
			What else would it be?
			My own heart was injured and a
			replacement was necessary. That
			would have been it except that
			the replacement is flawed and must
			now be put right.
			Why would anyone use a flawed
			replacement?
			Just pilot the shuttle, Ensign.
			All right. Let's get these
			repairs made so we can all be on
			our way.
			First officer to La Forge...
			Aye, Commander. Ready for
			transport.
			Proceed.
			Energize...
			Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm here
			to help. Take it easy.
			We are far from home.
			What seems to be the problem?
			Our ship is the Mondor.
			Right. I got that already.
			Who's in charge of engineering?
			My friend. His name is Reginod.
			Think I could meet him?
			We have an engineer.
			Great...
			He is Reginod.
			Yes, I think you mentioned that.
			We look for things.
			So I've heard.
			It is broken.
			Well... maybe I can fix it.
			Can you make our ship go?
			I think so.
			We look for things to make us go.
			Fellas... why don't you show me
			where your guidance system is?
			He is smart.
			Commander... Lieutenant La Forge
			is on an alien ship?
			Yes. We're rendering assistance
			to some curious throwbacks.
			How they ever mastered the
			rudiments of space travel is a
			genuine curiosity.
			Commander... Those aliens... what
			they feel is not helplessness
			... Lieutenant La Forge is in great
			danger!
			Danger... great danger...
			Can you be more specific,
			Counselor?
			They are insincere... It is not
			our help they want.
			Help is all they're going to get.
			They certainly can't force
			anything upon us, can they?
			You feel they are weak.
			Look at them. Not exactly Jarada
			or Romulans.
			Our Betazoid counselor is often
			aware of things beyond our
			perceptive abilities.
			Van Doren's technique has been
			perfected to two point four
			percent.
			Sir?
			The cardiac replacement procedure.
			It has a very low mortality rate.
			Two point four percent.
			Those are pretty good odds.
			The fact is, I'm not interested
			in having my innards become the
			subject of Starfleet gossip.
			Of course, sir. But why didn't
			you have Doctor Pulaski perform
			the operation? You could've
			trusted her to keep it quiet.
			Let's just say I have personal
			reasons and leave it at that,
			shall we?
			The power needs to be rerouted
			through this venturi chamber
			before it can be channeled through
			the engine coils.
			It is broken.
			But not for long. See? We're
			going to reconfigure these
			separators here...
			It is broken.
			You are brilliant.
			Actually, any first year
			engineering intern could do the
			same thing--
			Lieutenant La Forge, this is
			Commander Riker...
			Yes, Commander. Go ahead.
			Are you all right?
			Sure. Why do you ask?
			Counselor Troi has expressed
			misgivings about your absence from
			The Enterprise.
			I don't think there's much to
			worry about.
			Understood. But as soon as the
			repairs are completed, I want you
			back here.
			Aye, sir, I should be done
			momentarily.
			There. Guidance is up and
			running.
			Main power failure?
			Will our ship go now?
			The guidance system's repaired,
			but you're not going anywhere
			without main power.
			It is broken.
			Can you make it go?
			Commander Riker, it looks like
			this might take a little longer
			than I anticipated...
			You don't really care much for
			people, do you?
			What?
			It's okay. You can just do
			without most people. I can
			understand that --
			Ensign...Wesley. That's not true.
			I have great regard for you, for
			example. You're a fine young
			man.
			You don't have to say that.
			I do not say what I do not mean.
			Well, it's pretty obvious how you
			feel.
			Is it? How so?
			Well, everyone knows. You don't
			like kids.
			I simply have... other priorities.
			That's too bad.
			You might've made a pretty good
			father.
			Thank you.
			Didn't you ever wish you had kids
			of your own?
			Wishing for a thing does not make
			it so.
			We send him over there for one
			set of repairs and now they need
			him for more.
			Their ship is apparently quite
			fragile.
			This is Riker on board the
			Enterprise.
			I repeat. This is Commander Riker
			of the Enterprise.
			Almost got it, Commander--
			We look for things.
			Apparently your ship is in need
			of more than minor repairs.
			Things to make it go.
			We will use our tractor beam to
			tow you to your nearest base.
			He can make it go.
			Yes, but we need our chief
			engineer back on board our ship--
			He is smart.
			All done, Commander.
			Prepare to beam over.
			Yes, sir.
			You are good.
			Thanks. We aim to please.
			We need you.
			I'm flattered. Now I hate to
			repair and run, but if you'll
			excuse me...
			One to beam aboard--
			Hey!
			Transporter room, beam La Forge
			over immediately.
			Aye... negative response, sir!
			Try again!
			Negative response!
			The Pakled ship has a shield up,
			sir!
			A shield? What kind?
			It appears to be beyond their
			technology... similar to Romulan
			shields!
			Do not interfere with our
			transporter beam. Repeat. Drop
			your shield--
			Status!
			Viewer transmission terminated
			and blocked.
			Hail on all frequencies.
			Running frequency search...
			negative response.
			They're ignoring us!
			Apparently so, sir.
			Phasers ready, sir.
			Shields up.
			Shields up.
			Sensors at maximum sensitivity.
			Sensors at maximum.
			Phasers ready, sir.
			Hold fire. Lieutenant La Forge
			is on that ship.
			Were you ever married?
			My career always came first. I
			never had time.
			Don't you ever get lonely?
			There have been certain costs
			involved.
			Well, I'll bet you've broken your
			fair share of hearts along the
			way...
			A man needs to be careful about
			that sort of thing.
			Don't worry about me. Where women
			are concerned, I'm in complete
			control.
			Really? I've always had to work
			at it.
			Have you always known what you've
			wanted... been so disciplined?
			No.
			That's why I'm going in to get
			this thing replaced.
			I don't understand.
			Well... I was a young Starfleet
			officer. Just a few years older
			than you are now. Green as hell.
			Top of my Academy Class, and oh,
			so proud. Too proud, as it turned
			out.
			What happened?
			Several of us were on leave at
			Far Space Starbase
			Earhart... something of a galactic
			outpost in those days--
			Before the Klingons joined the
			Federation?
			That's right. My mates and I were
			at the Bonestell Recreation
			Facility, which was nothing more
			than a crossroads at the time.
			A trio of Nausicaans came in.
			They were spoiling for a
			confrontation with some
			fresh-faced young Starfleet
			officers like ourselves. Everyone
			in our group had the good sense
			to back away and give these
			Nausicaans wide berth. Everyone
			but me, that is. I stood
			toe-to-toe with the nastiest of
			the three and let him know what
			I thought of him, his partners,
			and his planet. I probably even
			made some passing reference to
			his questionable parentage.
			The next thing I knew, I had all
			three of them on me and I was
			fighting for my life. Acquitted
			myself quite well for several
			furious exchanges, I'm proud to
			say.
			You fought them? And won?
			I had this one Nausicaan down on
			the floor in a particularly
			devious joint-lock when before
			I knew what was happening, one
			of his cohorts drew his weapon
			and impaled me through the back.
			Strange sensation, actually. Not
			much pain. Shock, certainly, at
			the sight of serrated metal coming
			out of one's chest, and then a
			certain giddy warmth. As I
			recall, I actually laughed aloud.
			It pierced my heart, of course,
			and if we hadn't been so near a
			medical facility I would surely
			have died.
			Really? Really? Then what?
			Then nothing. I was no hero.
			I was an undisciplined,
			opinionated, loud-mouthed young
			man who was far out of his league.
			It was a great and painful lesson,
			but I learned it well. I only
			hope you won't need to learn it
			as I did...
			Data, come on...
			I am programming the comm system
			to scan the interference patterns,
			but a full analysis will take
			time.
			Please... no more.
			This is fun.
			My VISOR...
			This does something.
			Yes. It allows me to see.
			Where is it? Give it to me--
			Can you make us go now?
			He cannot make us go.
			He is not smart.
			This is smart.
			Be careful with that thing.
			You want to hurt us.
			What? I came here to help you.
			I fixed your guidance system and
			the main power generator, didn't
			I?
			We can make more.
			You have a replicator?
			It is not broken.
			I didn't come here to give you
			weapons.
			You will make more.
			Commander, a photon torpedo may
			penetrate their shield.
			Any hostile move on our part
			would only jeopardize Geordi.
			But what do the Pakleds want?
			Counselor?
			They have what they want... for
			now.
			Did you read that book I gave
			you?
			Some of it.
			That's reassuring.
			I just don't have much time.
			There is no greater challenge than
			the study of philosophy.
			William James sure won't be on
			my Starfleet exams.
			The important things never will
			be. Anyone can be trained to deal
			with technology, and the
			mechanics of piloting a starship.
			But Starfleet Academy--
			It takes more than just that.
			Open your mind to the past... to
			history, art, philosophy. And
			then...
			... this will mean something.
			Just consider James' wisdom:
			"Philosophy... is not a technical
			matter... it is our sense of what
			life honestly means... our
			individual way of feeling the
			total push and pressure of the
			cosmos."
			That's what I want for you.
			It is all deception. Lies.
			Everything? What about the
			distress call?
			Nothing the Pakleds have said or
			done has been sincere.
			Intensified scan shows their
			guidance system is perfectly
			intact, as is their power
			generator.
			Then what was Geordi repairing?
			Apparently, the putative
			malfunctions were carefully
			programmed into their ship's
			computer.
			I didn't think the Pakleds had
			that kind of technology.
			They seem to have made some
			technological leaps forward,
			Commander.
			But why would they go through
			the charade of needing our help?
			For the sole purpose of making
			Lieutenant La Forge their prisoner.
			Options?
			Tactically speaking, we have
			three choices: we can negotiate,
			attack, or simply abandon
			Lieutenant La Forge.
			You don't want to be late for your
			exams, Ensign.
			I've still got some time, sir.
			Why do I get the feeling you're
			acting like some kind of escort?
			Doctor Pulaski asked me to make
			sure you actually went inside.
			That woman. She would.
			Sir?
			What is it?
			I enjoyed our trip together.
			So did I.
			They are initiating visual
			contact--
			Maybe we'll find out what the hell
			they really want.
			Enterprise.
			We demand the immediate return
			of our crewmember.
			Request denied.
			Lower your shield!
			Request denied.
			Stop it! What do you want?
			Your ship has bigger ones.
			For defense against attack.
			Your ship is strong. Smart.
			Our strength contributes to peace
			in this region of the galaxy.
			We mean no one harm.
			You think we are not smart.
			I think you need to continue to
			develop --
			We are smart.
			Prove it. Return our man to us.
			You want him?
			Yes, dammit!
			Good. We want all computer
			information from your ship.
			Now.
			We've got a man held hostage by
			alien forces and all I have are
			non-option options! I'd like some
			input...
			Is Geordi all right?
			They've already hit him with
			multiple phaser stuns.
			He could need medical attention.
			Security team stands ready to take
			the initiative, sir.
			Data?
			Our options have not changed.
			We can either respond to the
			Pakled demand or not. We can
			either use force or not.
			I've already answered their
			demand. Allowing access to the
			Enterprise computers by alien
			forces would be a complete breech
			of Starfleet security.
			Then force it must be.
			Ready?
			Get on with it, Doctor. I've got
			work to do.
			Activate Sterile Field. Neural
			calipers.
			This will be a secondary cardiac
			procedure with mid-line entry and
			excision of the early model unit.
			I anticipate no complications as
			the patient has had positive
			primary results and exhibits
			extraordinary physical condition.
			We'll all be home in time for
			dinner.
			Tissue mitigator.
			There is very little information
			available on Pakled culture, but
			the eclectic range of their
			equipment would suggest that
			everything they have has been
			stolen from others.
			And now they have become militant.
			So it would seem.
			Rationale?
			They are unwilling to wait for
			the timely evolution of their
			species' intellectual capacity.
			They seek instant knowledge,
			instant power and gratification.
			You make them sound like petulant
			children.
			Yes. Infantile humans are known
			for responses of a similar nature.
			Then suppose we treat them like
			children.
			Sir?
			It's time we set some limits.
			To what effect, sir? We are faced
			with an impossible conundrum.
			Not if we let Geordi give them
			something they want... and then
			create the right moment for him
			to take it away.
			Would you be suggesting a ruse
			of some sort?
			I would.
			And what if it fails? What'll
			happen to Geordi then?
			We don't have any choice. We have
			to try.
			There has been some capillary
			reaction here... let's proceed
			carefully... we'll need sharper
			focus on the thoracic
			polychromatics and verification
			of myocardial enzyme balance.
			Let me talk to them. I'll get
			you their computer banks.
			We want to be smart.
			So open the hailing frequency.
			They'll listen to me.
			We are smart.
			We need their computer things.
			Yes.
			Yes.
			Commander Riker?
			Yes, Lieutenant. We're here.
			The Pakleds seem pretty sincere.
			We want what we want.
			Our computer banks are
			non-negotiable.
			Excuse me, Commander, but let's
			consider that for a minute. The
			Enterprise's protected memory
			storage is so extensive that it
			would take well over twenty-four
			hours just to access.
			In that time, maybe we could all
			reach a more acceptable resolution
			to our little misunderstanding
			here.
			We want to be smart.
			Belive me, they're nothing if not
			persistent.
			We want to be nothing if not
			persistent.
			Nobody ever said they were great
			conversationalists.
			Where did they get their shields?
			Yes. We like shields.
			From what I've seen, half the
			systems on this ship have been
			stolen from Romulans, Jarada,
			Klingons, just about anybody they
			ever came in contact with.
			We like to be smart.
			Confirmed, Lieutenant La Forge.
			They steal technology.
			But they lack the ability to use
			it properly.
			You're an excellent chief
			engineer, Lieutenant.
			Thank you, sir.
			And of course, your knowledge
			of phaser and photon weaponry is
			unmatched.
			We like phasers.
			That's kind of you to say, sir,
			but Lieutenant Worf --
			Our missions are always inherently
			dangerous. Any of us could be
			called upon to make the ultimate
			sacrifice at any time.
			Uh... yes, sir, but --
			Speaking of time, Lieutenant,
			this may be your time. I shall
			personally miss you.
			You will always be in my memory.
			Data... wait a minute. Can't
			we.. ?
			I shall miss you at weapons
			systems analysis.
			Weapons system analysis?
			I guess you'll just have to carry
			out the photon torpedo countdowns
			without me.
			Exactly. Fond farewell.
			He knows about weapons.
			He is smart.
			You can make us strong.
			It's not something I like to talk
			about --
			Lieutenant La Forge.
			Worf... my old friend.
			Any classified weapons knowledge
			you share with your captors will
			be considered treason.
			I may have no choice.
			You will die without honor.
			I know. Just my luck.
			You will never attain the
			twenty-four levels of awareness.
			Twenty-four? That's quite a
			challenge.
			Indeed. Twenty-four is the
			gateway to heroic salvation.
			Do you think he understands?
			He'd better.
			He is afraid.
			We all are, Counselor.
			You are smart.
			Not smart enough. I'm still here.
			Make us strong.
			I thought you wanted me to help
			you... "go". Why don't we work
			on that guidance system, okay?
			Make us strong. Or die.
			The metabilation occlusions aren't
			holding.
			Damnit! I can't stop the
			heterocyclic declination! Fuse!
			Again!
			We need a Biomolecular
			Physiologist in here! This man
			is dying!
			You've gotta be kidding.
			Make us strong.
			There isn't enough juice in these
			to blow off a passing asteroid.
			Do it. Make us strong.
			I suppose we could increase the
			anti-matter charges.
			Yes. We like power.
			Do not try to trick us. We can
			tell.
			Metabilation?
			Negative.
			Heterocyclics?
			Failing. And capillary integrity
			too unpredictable to attempt a
			resect.
			You're unwilling to make the
			attempt??
			I'm not qualified.
			I know someone who is.
			Are you sure he can do it? He's
			an engineer, not a weapons
			specialist.
			True. But if anyone can
			improvise, it's Geordi.
			What makes you think the Pakleds
			even have that kind of gear on
			board?
			Ongoing scanning indicates
			progressive weapons potential.
			The timing will be crucial. He
			must correctly interpret our
			intentions.
			Geordi's up to speed. I trust
			his instincts.
			The Pakleds did hear our little
			fiction about Geordi's "weapons
			knowledge."
			Exactly. And since they obviously
			equate intelligence with strength,
			they won't pass up this chance
			to use that knowledge.
			Can you do it?
			Count on it.
			Bridge to Commander Riker!
			Go ahead, bridge --
			I am receiving an emergency
			summons from Starbase
			five one five... Captain Picard
			is close to death!
			Be ready!
			We are strong.
			You're now armed to the teeth.
			Teeth are for chewing.
			You have photon torpedoes. You
			are strong.
			We are strong. We have power.
			Positive indication of armed
			photon torpedoes, Commander.
			Geordi did it.
			Starbase requests we proceed to
			base at warp nine --
			We've got to go!
			Yes. Captain Picard needs our
			help.
			We can't leave Geordi behind --
			I want the Pakleds on that screen
			and I want them now!
			Forced spectrum communications
			are spotty at best, sir.
			Do it.
			This is the Enterprise. Return
			our personnel or face immediate
			reprisal.
			We are strong now. We have better
			weapons.
			Are you prepared to use them?
			We are a force now. We will have
			respect. Power.
			They feel confident.
			We don't have time for this. You
			want power? This is power...
			Bridge to Ensign Gomez...
			Ready, Commander Riker --
			Initiate sequencing.
			Begin firing sequence countdown
			from twenty-four.
			They mean business. Let me just
			check something.
			Twenty-one... twenty...
			nineteen... eighteen...
			Seventeen... sixteen...
			fifteen... fourteen...
			Firing sequence proceeding, sir.
			Hold fast.
			Eleven... ten... nine...
			We will attack.
			We are strong.
			We should attack now.
			Just another second here...
			Hurry.
			six... five... four... three...
			...two... one...
			Fire!
			Now!
			Oh no! Too late!
			We have fired! They will be
			destroyed.
			But they used the crimson
			force-field --
			It did not shoot.
			Their crimson force-field disarmed
			us.
			They are smart.
			We are not strong.
			Drop your shields and let us
			transport Lieutenant La Forge
			immediately.
			Shields are down.
			Transporter Room. One to beam
			to the bridge.
			Set heading for Starbase
			five one five. Warp nine.
			We leave you in peace.
			We want to be strong.
			Weapons alone do not create
			strength. You must learn
			restraint.
			Yes. We will learn restraint.
			Then we will be strong.
			Off.
			What was that red blast?
			Hydrogen exhaust through the
			Bussard collectors. Harmless,
			but a nice light show.
			Very impressive.
			Did you disable their photons?
			Just in time. That's why you're
			all standing here...
			What in the hell are you doing
			here?
			Saving your life.
			Oh come on. This is a routine
			procedure. Quite commonplace.
			True. But you are not a
			commonplace man. You'll be out
			of recovery in four hours.
			I didn't want you involved in
			this.
			You're welcome.
			If you're here... the entire crew
			must know...
			You're still the captain.
			Invincible.
			Thank you.
			I beg your pardon.
			Looks like things are back to
			normal...
			I'm pleased to report that Ensign
			Crusher's Starfleet exam results
			will enable him to continue with
			his studies on board the
			Enterprise. Furthermore, any
			rumors of my brush with death
			are greatly exaggerated. Is that
			clear?
			Yes, sir.
			Good. Set the course for Epsilon
			Sector.
			Warp five, Ensign.
			Engage.
