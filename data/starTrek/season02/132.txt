			Captain's log, Stardate 42411.2.
			The Enterprise has been
			unexpectedly diverted to the
			Ramatis star system. The two
			sides of a bitter little planetary
			conflict have petitioned Starfleet
			to transport to their world a
			mediator they have mutually
			selected. Our orders are
			transportation only -- no
			interference, no responsibilities.
			It is a mission much to my
			liking.
			Reduce to half impulse.
			Reducing velocity to one-half
			impulse.
			Come.
			Ah, Number One. Look at this.
			Ever since we left the Lima-Sierra
			system, I have been puzzling over
			how the third planet could
			maintain such an orbit, when it
			is theoretically impossible, but
			consider this.
			There's no degeneration?
			Exactly!
			Why?
			I haven't got that worked out.
			Perhaps this facsimile lacks mass.
			Yes, somewhat, but if this is an
			accurate representation -- would
			it not explain what happened in
			that system?
			Perhaps.
			Well, not a matter of great moment -- just
			a knot I had to untie.
			Now... What was it you wanted to
			see me about?
			Captain, we have arrived at
			Ramatis Three.
			Ah -- well -- time to leave.
			Standard orbit, Mister Crusher.
			Standard orbit.
			Data, you have the bridge.
			I am still uncomfortable about
			your leading this away team.
			This is not an away team in the
			strictest sense. I consider this
			more of a ceremonial function.
			For me not to go, could be
			construed a lack of respect, or
			that I do not regard the mission
			as significant. Transporter Room
			Five.
			Considering the importance of this
			mission and the lives which are
			at stake... I don't want to do
			anything which would have a
			negative affect on this
			negotiation, however...
			I appreciate your concern, Number
			One, but, I'm sure it will go
			quite smoothly.
			We have come a great distance for
			this mediator.
			They asked for the best and that
			person, from all reports, is Riva.
			I've never heard of him.
			I'm not surprised, he hasn't
			mediated for several decades.
			That's a long time to be out of
			the saddle. Let's hope he's not
			rusty.
			Yes, for all our sakes... let's
			hope Riva is at the top of his
			game.
			Coordinates have been input.
			Very good, Lieutenant. Worry not,
			Number One -- this will be a simple
			ceremonial greeting, and right
			back to the Enterprise.
			I'm sure.
			Energize.
			Captain, this is the Enterprise.
			We have arrived safely, Number
			One, and for the most part, we've
			been ignored... ah...
			... some of the local citizenry
			are beginning to assemble. I'll
			keep you informed.
			I would appreciate it.
			Riva.
			eeennniYOO.
			He is a well-liked leader. Their
			affection is genuine, as is his.
			Well, if they respect him on
			Solais, as much as they do here -- we
			could be looking forward to
			a successful mission.
			Counselor?
			I've never seen anything like this
			before and I'm a little uncertain
			about how to proceed.
			There is a wonderful feeling of
			well being, emanating from here.
			Please -- come closer.
			Before I start, is there anything
			you need? Refreshments, food.
			No. But thank you for asking.
			Then --
			Proceed.
			Greetings from the United
			Federation of Planets. I am
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the
			USS Enterprise. This is Counselor
			Troi, and Lieutenant Worf.
			GREETINGS!
			Welcome to Ramatis.
			I have been expecting you.
			You're empathic.
			Yes.
			Then, although you already know
			my feelings toward you, allow
			me to put them into words. I
			am looking forward to this
			journey, now more than ever,
			because it gives me the chance
			to spend time in your company.
			I am flattered. And I too, look
			forward to learning more about
			you.
			There's a very different kind of
			communication here, Captain.
			Yes, so I see. I think there are
			facets to Riva about which we were
			not informed.
			Precisely. It is a process which
			has developed over the centuries
			and one I find quite harmonious.
			So Riva the famous mediator is... ?
			Deaf.
			Born, and hope to die.
			And you all speak for Riva?
			Yes.
			I not only convey his words, but
			his emotional intent as well.
			The members of the Chorus, serve
			as "translators," and each
			represents the archetypes of man's
			personality.
			I am the scholar. I represent
			the intellect. I speak in
			matters of judgment -- philosophy -- logic.
			Also, I am -- the dreamer.
			The part which longs to see the
			beauty beyond the truth which is
			always the first duty of art.
			I am the poet...
			Artists tend to ramble, they live
			too much in the future, they
			neglect the moment. I am Riva's
			libido. I am his passion. I am
			the anarchy of lust. The romantic -- the
			... lover. Also, I am as he.
			The definition of Riva's honor...
			the perfect line which never
			wavers.
			And you...
			I represent that part of Riva
			which binds all the others
			together. I am harmony -- wisdom -- balance.
			Remarkable. How did this...
			Speak to me!
			What?!
			Speak directly to me!
			He's prodding you to get a
			reaction.
			The uniqueness of this
			presentation provoked my
			inadvertent breach in protocol.
			No insult was intended.
			Then... none is perceived.
			I was curious about how this
			unique form of communication came
			about.
			The gene for hearing is not
			present in our planet's ruling
			line.
			Not that unusual, indeed it is
			similar to the English Tudor
			monarchs of your planet Earth,
			all who had hemophilia. Or the
			leaders of Fendaus Five, who were
			without limbs.
			Throughout time, many of the
			galaxy's greatest contributors
			have been similarly "special."
			Your ability to read lips -- is
			very impressive.
			Thank you.
			Your "translators" do not see you,
			yet they are able to accurately
			convey your thoughts.
			My Chorus is so attuned -- they
			can "hear" my hands and translate
			to you. It is a relationship
			which has developed over centuries -- their
			ancestors provided the
			same service to my ancestors.
			Your way of communication is most
			distinctive, Riva.
			It takes a fine mind to appreciate
			that, Counselor Troi.
			This part of you does not seem
			to speak very often.
			Only when the spirit moves me.
			Riva -- if you are ready -- the
			situation at Solais Five is very
			critical. We should not delay.
			I will prepare for departure
			immediately.
			Are you all -- I mean -- Riva, did
			you plan to take these people with
			you?
			Is that a problem?
			No, it's just that we didn't know
			you would all be coming.
			How long will my journey to
			Solais take?
			More than two of your days.
			Then, until duty calls, this will
			indeed be a pleasant trip.
			With your permission, Captain.
			Make it so.
			Enterprise, this is the away team,
			seven to beam up.
			The away team, plus four, is on
			board.
			Acknowledged. Ensign, set your
			course for Solais Five.
			Course is set.
			Velocity -- warp eight.
			Warp eight -- aye.
			Engage, Mister Crusher.
			Yes, sir.
			Riva, may I present--
			What's this?
			These three -- speak for Riva.
			You mean, the most respected
			negotiator in the Federation -- is
			deaf? Amazing.
			First, Captain, let me say that
			it is an honor to be on board such
			a fine vessel.
			Now... please continue with the
			introductions.
			This is my first officer,
			Commander Riker.
			It is an honor to meet you.
			Lieutenant Commander Data.
			It is a pleasure to meet such a
			unique individual.
			Thank you...
			And our chief medical officer,
			Katherine Pulaski.
			Doctor.
			This is Lieutenant La Forge.
			Pleased to meet you, sir.
			What is that you're wearing?
			A VISOR. It modifies the
			electromagnetic spectrum and
			carries the readings to my brain.
			And without it, can you see?
			No. Without it I'm as blind as
			a post.
			Your VISOR serves the same purpose
			as my Chorus, which "hears" my
			thoughts and translates them into
			sound.
			Yes.
			And you don't resent it?
			The VISOR or being blind?
			Either.
			They are both part of me, and
			since I like who I am, why would
			I resent either being blind or
			wearing the VISOR?
			What is your position on this
			ship?
			Engineering officer, sir.
			It's a blessing to understand we
			are special...
			... each in his own way.
			My feeling exactly.
			Please call me Riva.
			Okay. And you can call me Geordi.
			I will have you shown to you
			quarters, then at your convenience
			I have prepared a briefing on the
			Solari wars? I offer the
			hospitality of my ship during this
			journey. We will provide whatever
			is necessary to make you
			comfortable or to facilitate your
			mission.
			Thank you.
			Perhaps, if it is not
			inconvenient, Counselor Troi could
			escort me.
			With your permission.
			This way.
			What about you?
			At times like this -- we become
			an encumbrance.
			... so if you have a room for us,
			we'll wait until Riva makes
			contact.
			Exactly how will he do that?
			The headband that he wears -- it
			transmits his thoughts, and
			emotions to us.
			So that's how it work.
			No magic -- just technology.
			Worf, could you provide an escort.
			He's not what I expected.
			Perhaps being "special" is in part
			responsible for his success. He
			has a most disarming quality.
			He doesn't just ask questions
			to be polite -- he actually wants
			to hear the answers.
			Much of what we do is similar.
			Yes -- I suppose in a way it is.
			We have both learned how to allow
			people to examine feelings hidden
			deep within their psyche. In
			fact, being here with you is
			provoking an emotional revelation.
			You mean something I am doing is
			uncovering an emotion buried in
			your psyche.
			Not that deep.
			Oh, exactly what are you feeling?
			Can't you tell?
			Some of it -- but...
			I feel that soon, perhaps after
			the briefing by your captain, you
			will be hungry, and perhaps we
			could dine together and
			compare... experiences.
			I would like that.
			As will I.
			Will you...
			... be with us?
			Until we find our own method of
			communication.
			I look forward to that time.
			As do I.
			Commander Data, would you please
			update the situation.
			The factions on Solais Five are
			historical enemies. So many have
			died that both societies are on
			the verge of extinction.
			Enough. Thank you, Captain, but
			there is no need to continue.
			The specific issues of the
			conflict have no relevance.
			So none of the background we have
			prepared would be helpful in
			understanding why they continue
			to fight?
			The portfolio will indicate that
			the conflict is over a piece of
			land, or wealth, or some other
			tangible asset. But, we both know
			that is not the case.
			A war which has been fought for
			this long has become very
			personal.
			Exactly. The basis for peace must
			also be personal.
			This is an historic confrontation.
			Correct?
			The factions have been at war for
			fifteen centuries.
			What's changed?
			I do not know what you mean.
			They have been killing each other
			for a long time, now they want
			to talk peace. So something about
			this situation has changed.
			What's the new piece to the
			puzzle?
			That piece of information could
			be very useful. Data.
			Unknown.
			Perhaps they are running out of
			people to kill. In any case, for
			whatever reason -- peace is now
			preferred. That should make your
			job easier.
			Well, if not easier, at least
			possible, because they are
			motivated.
			But it doesn't matter. I'll find
			something. I always do.
			Always?
			To date, I have never failed.
			Now, unless there is something
			else...
			No. This is for your benefit.
			Then... thank you for your time
			and effort... if you'll excuse
			me...
			I believe I have to get ready
			for a dinner appointment.
			Then, by all means, meeting is
			adjourned.
			Our mediator is very...
			... self assured.
			Cocky is the word I would have
			used.
			It's all right if he can deliver,
			and we'll know that soon enough.
			We are approaching Solais Five.
			Half impulse.
			Slowing to one-half impulse.
			We have arrived.
			Then we don't have much time.
			No.
			This has been very pleasant.
			For me as well. I'm impressed,
			by how you deal with what some
			would consider a handicap.
			It's not a handicap at all.
			Unless you mean having me here.
			I did not mean that specifically,
			but, yes, I would consider you
			a disadvantage.
			How do we communicate? I can feel
			your emotions, but don't we need
			words?
			I don't understand.
			Is that dream?
			Love.
			Stronger. Like you mean it.
			Butterfly.
			Is that a butterfly -- or is that
			desire?
			Standard orbit.
			Captain!
			I'm reading laser activity in the
			Solari Solar System!
			How concentrated is the activity?
			It is localized -- and very
			intense.
			So much for the cease-fire.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			I can establish voice only.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
			commander of the Federation
			starship USS Enterprise.
			If you continue to violate the
			rules by breaking the cease-fire,
			I will abort this mission.
			You have no jurisdiction here,
			Picard. Where is Riva?
			Riva is in charge of the summit.
			I command the ship that brings
			him. I will not endanger my ship
			under any circumstances.
			Riva gave his word we would speak
			to no one else. Now who breaks
			the rules? Where is Riva?
			I shall summon him for you.
			Get Riva now!
			Counselor Troi. Have Riva report
			to the bridge immediately.
			They need you on the bridge.
			Now!
			The cease-fire has been broken.
			I'm sure I can resolve that. Put
			them on the viewscreen.
			On viewscreen.
			The quality of the transmission
			is very poor.
			It is sufficient.
			Brothers! Your bravery as
			fighters is known, now you must
			demonstrate your courage in a new
			way -- cease hostilities -- allow
			us to meet.
			The laser fire has ceased.
			But for how long -- these Solari
			don't seem likely candidates for
			peace.
			I will need to see a topographical
			overlay of the battle area in
			order to pick a site for the
			meetings. Then I will need your
			help in creating the proper
			setting.
			We are here to provide whatever
			service is necessary.
			There -- beam us down to that
			hilltop and inform the factions
			to join us. The time for killing
			has come to an end.
			Set phasers on stun.
			You won't need those.
			I'm sure we won't.
			Energize.
			Yes. This will do.
			It is important that we set this
			up properly.
			Commander. If it be possible -- I
			would like torches -- there -- there - there
			-- and there.
			Engineering, this is the away
			team.
			Yes, Commander.
			We are going to need your help.
			Yes, I thought you might.
			We are going to need torches --
			head high.
			... and what else?
			I would like a table and
			chairs --
			... right here.
			Describe it.
			Round, about three meters in
			diameter, and if possible made
			out of indigenous rock.
			Did you copy that, Geordi?
			I did. There should be no problem
			replicating a table like that.
			I have the coordinates -- I'll
			send down the torches, and get
			right on the table.
			How long before the emissaries
			arrive?
			It shouldn't be too long.
			They are coming.
			How long will it take for these
			negotiations?
			From that question, you must think
			they will go quickly.
			Actually, until this moment I
			never thought much about it at
			all.
			Commander.
			The first few minutes will be very
			tense. Please...
			... ah... stay calm, and do not
			respond even if you are provoked.
			We will do our best.
			Who is Riva?
			I am Riva.
			Be at ease. I commend you both.
			To come here shows not only
			courage, but wisdom. Please -- give
			this conference a chance.
			I have no magic. You have been
			fighting all your lives. You know
			only...
			Riva -- what is it?
			This is a trap.
			Enterprise -- beam us up. Now!
			Captain's log.
			So... communication between Riva
			and his Chorus was aided by this
			device. Without it...
			Without it, he is mute.
			Can you fix it?
			Can it be fixed?
			We must calm him.
			Lieutenant La Forge. See what
			you can learn about this. If it's
			possible to repair it, I need to
			know.
			Right away.
			This is astounding. Nothing like
			this has ever happened.
			I need your help.
			But what can we do? It's Riva...
			We don't know anything. We just
			say what he tells us.
			We need to communicate with him.
			Surely you know sign language.
			No.
			We've never needed it.
			And he neither reads nor writes.
			He's never had to.
			Riva knows sign language. He
			learned it on a mission to the
			Plaeties system. The parties
			there were so paranoid they would
			not allow us to accompany him.
			Captain -- what's going to happen?
			I feel so strange. I've never
			been without him before... never.
			I feel like I'm losing my mind.
			You'll be all right. Stay here.
			I'll send someone to look after
			you. Please... try to stay calm.
			Deafness for all intents and
			purposes has been eliminated
			except for a few isolated
			situations like this. If I can
			help you medically -- will you
			allow it?
			Riva knows sign language.
			Captain. There are just in the
			Federation, eighty-one different
			variations of signing.
			Find a way to communicate with
			him.
			Take him to Sickbay. Doctor do
			what you can.
			You are not alone. We will solve
			this together.
			If Riva does not mediate this
			summit successfully, the Solari
			will destroy each other.
			But if he can't speak, and can't
			use his Chorus, he's useless.
			Captain, you should mediate.
			It is not me they want. They
			believe in Riva. The problem
			is, he no longer believes in
			himself.
			Keep me posted of Riva's progress.
			I'll be in my quarters.
			Yes sir.
			We have to find a way to talk
			to him.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8.
			We are monitoring increased
			military activity on Solais Five.
			I fear that we will be unable to
			keep the Solari from destroying
			themselves without Riva and still
			he is silent.
			How's it going?
			I have eliminated all but five
			distinct forms of signing. I will
			learn them all.
			Computer. Show me gestural
			language -- designation M-nine.
			Interesting. A technique of
			communication which is both silent
			and covert. It could be very
			useful.
			As a language -- the use of
			gestures and hand signals
			pre-dates the spoken word in most
			cultures. The major exception
			being the Leyrons of Malkus Nine
			who actually developed a written
			language first.
			Computer - continue presentation.
			Increase.
			Increase.
			Increase.
			Increase.
			He's very frightened. All his
			life he's been in control. For
			once, he doesn't have the answers.
			Since Riva has never had hearing,
			his brain cannot accept auditory
			information.
			Which means?
			There is no immediate medical
			solution available.
			Let's see how Geordi is coming.
			I've never seen anything like this
			before. It transmits Beta waves,
			but I can't figure exactly how.
			I wish I had thought to run a test
			while it was still functioning.
			Can you help?
			If he could tell me anything,
			anything at all.
			Well, I'll continue to work on
			it.
			I know what you must be going
			through. I can imagine what it
			would be like to lose my VISOR.
			But... we'll find something.
			Don't give up.
			Too late. I think he already has.
			Come.
			How is our mediator?
			The same. Unreachable.
			What can we do to help him?
			I can't do anything. It's up to
			him. Confidence is faith in
			oneself, it can't be given by
			another.
			You're right, of course.
			Come.
			Captain, I have reviewed and
			stored five distinct signing
			languages.
			This is blue. This is a blue
			ocean. This is a blue ocean at
			sunset. This is two people
			walking along the beach by a blue
			ocean at sunset. This is two
			happy people in love walking along
			the beach by a blue ocean at
			sunset. This is --
			Enough!
			Let's talk to Riva.
			Good news. Data has learned your
			language. He can translate for
			you at the summit.
			It will not work. I need my
			words.
			There -- that is what I mean. Your
			translation is literal. You say
			words. I do not need just words -- I
			need nuance, and subtlety...
			the shadings my Chorus enable me
			to communicate.
			But your ability is unchanged.
			All that's different is the method
			of transmission.
			No! I cannot!
			It's not working. Go another
			direction.
			Data can understand you. Use him
			as your Chorus. Let him express
			your words.
			No -- it is not the same thing.
			Data is unacceptable...
			You've got to take advantage of
			what you've got...
			What I have got. I have got
			nothing. Do you not understand - I
			cannot do it.
			You're right. Maybe you are all
			show.
			You hide behind your Chorus.
			You're a fake.
			You are attempting to provoke me.
			It is not going to work.
			That's too bad. A lot of people
			are going to die.
			Data.
			We will return you to Ramatis.
			... but, first I am going to
			attempt to settle the conflict
			on Solais.
			You.
			We have come this far -- it would
			be difficult for me personally
			to leave without making the
			attempt.
			It could be dangerous.
			Help me.
			How?
			We all earn our reputations.
			Yours is that of a very successful
			negotiator -- a mediator.
			And you want to know the trick.
			If there is one - yes.
			Captain, there is no secret. What
			I do is help one person -- one
			group -- express themselves to the
			other.
			Simple enough to say - difficult
			to accomplish.
			The real trick is getting them
			to listen. To understand. To
			turn a disadvantage to an
			advantage.
			Then why can't you turn your
			disadvantage into an advantage?
			That is an interesting thought...
			I do not understand -- what thought
			is he referring to?
			Thank you.
			I will contact those down on the
			planet. Tell them to prepare to
			begin discussions immediately.
			Set phasers on stun.
			Energize.
			Could you relight the torches,
			to let them know that I am back.
			I would like the table right here.
			Make it so.
			Main Engineering, this is
			Commander Data.
			Go ahead, Data.
			You can beam the table down now.
			It could be a while before the
			emissaries arrive. They will be
			more cautious after the last
			incident.
			You can leave whenever you choose.
			I will get a message out when I
			am ready to leave.
			Captain -- I do not understand what
			is going on here? Without his
			interpreters, how can he mediate?
			Riva is going to teach them sign
			language.
			Yes -- it is turning a disadvantage
			into an advantage. Learning how
			to sign will actually become part
			of the process of them learning
			how to live together in peace.
			As they learn how to communicate
			with Riva, they will be learning
			to communicate with each other.
			... and that is the first and most
			important step in any
			relationship.
			Captain, although it took me only
			moments to learn sign language,
			it will take them months.
			Time well spent.
			These people have been fighting
			all their lives, they know only
			hatred, suspicion, fear. Even
			with my Chorus -- I could not have
			changed those attitudes in a day.
			We have a chance, and they want
			the talks to be successful or they
			would not have called me.
			Enterprise -- two to beam up.
			Good luck.
			And to you.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8.
			Personal comment. I am confident
			that Riva can help the Solari
			achieve a lasting peace. We will
			deliver his Chorus to Starbase
			Seven-One-Three so they can be
			returned to Ramatis.
			Take us out of orbit.
			Come.
			Sir?
			Yes, Mister La Forge, something on
			your mind?
			Sir, I know my VISOR gives me a
			unique way of seeing that's
			valuable to the ship, but if
			something happened and I didn't
			have it --
			What makes you unique isn't your
			blindness or your VISOR --
			To be special we don't need to
			do a damned thing. Just be what
			we are.
			There's only one Geordi La Forge.
			And I wouldn't want to run my ship
			without him.
			All right!
			I mean, thank you sir.
			Dismissed.
			Optic nerve laser welding. A
			difficult operation. It might
			not work. But if it did, it would
			open up a whole world for you.
			I'll think about it.
			Set course, two-two-four, mark,
			three-nine.
			What is our destination?
			Alpha Delta Beta. A routine
			transport mission.
			I thought this was supposed to
			be a routine transport mission.
			Engage!
