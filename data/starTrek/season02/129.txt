			Captain's log, Stardate 42486.3.
			We have arrived on station at
			coordinates -- three-six-two-
			nine-mark-five-eight-four,
			three days early for our
			rendezvous with USS Victory.
			There is nothing to do now, but
			hold this position and wait.
			Yes, Commander?
			Is there a problem? Chief
			Engineer La Forge called for me.
			"Urgent!"
			Oh, of course.
			He's over there with the Victory.
			I just had a strange conversation
			with your assistant. Although
			it is three days until we
			rendezvous with Starship Victory,
			she...
			She believes it has already
			arrived.
			But not the starship, my friend.
			The original!
			This is my gift to Starship
			Victory's Captain Zimbata.
			Ah, most unusual.
			I served as an ensign under him.
			I wish he'd been in command of
			this Victory. Wind and sail,
			that's the proper way to move a
			ship.
			But your Starfleet specialty, my
			friend, is antimatter power,
			dilithium regulators...
			Which is exactly why this
			fascinates me. Data, it's human
			nature to love what we don't have.
			Simpler days!
			While stringing this rigging, I
			was dreaming of sail handling
			and...
			This is not a computer simulation?
			Data, the entire point of
			something like this is to hand
			make it.
			Just as you have used Old England
			in a hobby of your own.
			Geordi... your message said
			"urgent."
			And it is, my friend. While we
			wait to rendezvous with Victory,
			we have time for me to be Watson.
			More properly, your Watson.
			My Watson?
			You've seen my dream adventure...
			now let me share in one of yours.
			Ah, yes. Yes, my dear colleague,
			that does seem only fair.
			I'll be gone awhile, Clancy. See
			that no one touches this!
			Aye, sir. And where can I reach
			you?
			He can be reached at 221B Baker
			Street.
			Sir?
			Computer -- select at random a
			mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
			where I will play Sherlock Holmes
			and Lieutenant La Forge will be
			Doctor Watson.
			Program complete -- you may enter.
			Excellent.
			Look at all of the detail... and
			everything here has some
			significance?
			Holmes collected nothing -- neither
			trinkets nor thoughts which were
			not specifically significant to
			him.
			This?
			The emerald tie pin presented to
			Holmes by Queen Victoria after
			he solved the theft of the
			Bruce-Partington plans.
			A copy of Whitaker's Almanack
			which provided Holmes the key to
			the secret code in "The Valley
			of Fear."
			The snuff box of Wilhelm
			Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein.
			All right -- you solve the cases
			and get the gifts, what do I do?
			Primarily as Doctor Watson, you
			keep a written record of
			everything I do for later
			publication.
			And the famous Holmes violin.
			He purchased this in a pawn shop
			in Tottenham Court Road for
			fifty-five shillings, which he
			considered a very good investment.
			In the hands of some, the violin
			is a wondrous thing, equally
			capable of stirring the soul to
			the heights of bliss as to the
			depths of despair...
			Incredible, Data! How can you
			play it like that?
			Merely throwing myself into the
			part, Watson.
			In the masterful grasp of my
			friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the
			violin ceases to be a musical
			instrument at all and becomes...
			Watson! We are about to have
			guests.
			Answer it, Watson -- let's not keep
			the good inspector waiting.
			Inspector who?
			Why Lestrade of course.
			Holmes, are you there, man?
			Thank the Almighty you're
			available tonight, Holmes, I'm
			in a deuce of a dilemma.
			Then may I say your perturbation
			becomes you, Inspector Lestrade,
			whilst simultaneously affording
			me yet another chance to serve
			Queen and country.
			Data, is that the way Holmes
			really talked?
			Absolutely.
			Exactly... You see, this gentleman
			here --
			-- the emissary of a foreign
			government -- has been the victim
			of a most accidentally wicked
			crime...
			Damn!
			Haven't they invented electric
			lights by now?
			What, dear fellow?
			Watson, please!
			Pray go on, Inspector.
			Well, to put the matter simply,
			Holmes, this man was accosted by
			gypsies bent on depriving him of
			his most valuable possessions...
			and, in the process of picking
			his pockets clean, the gypsies
			also happened to bag a photograph
			this man was carrying --
			Great Scott! It's the photograph!
			I believe, Inspector, that you
			will find that this emissary here
			works not for but against the King
			of Bohemia, and that photograph
			of the king and his ex-mistress
			is to be used as blackmail.
			Further, upon deeper reflection,
			you will deduce, as did I, that...
			Computer, freeze program. Exit!
			Where are you going?
			I'm done.
			But I was just about to reveal
			that the "sir" is in fact a
			"madame," and that...
			Forget it, Data.
			What was the point to going onto
			the Holodeck?
			To solve a Sherlock Holmes
			mystery.
			Exactly, but, you've got them all
			memorized. The first time someone
			opens their mouth, you've got it
			solved. So, there's really no
			mystery. If there's no mystery...
			there's no game... no game...
			no fun.
			I'm not angry with you, Data,
			really... It's just that... we
			go to all the trouble to arrange
			time to come down to the Holodeck,
			to get the proper wardrobe, to
			get into character, and, boom,
			it barely gets started and you
			jump to the end. See, I was
			looking forward to the chase.
			Then I should have extended the
			sequence of events.
			I'm not getting through. The fun
			of the program is the attempt to
			solve a mystery.
			That is exactly what we were
			doing.
			You are wasting your breath,
			Lieutenant.
			Saying that to Data is asking a
			computer not to compute.
			Am I so different from you,
			Doctor? Can you cease thinking
			on command?
			In medicine I face many puzzles
			to which I do not know the answer.
			She's right, Data. You always
			know the answer.
			To feel the thrill of a victory...
			there must be the possibility of
			failure.
			Where's the victory winning a
			battle you can't possibly lose?
			Are you suggesting that there is
			some value in losing?
			Yes. That's the great teacher.
			We humans often learn more from
			a mistake or a failure than we
			do from an easy success. But not
			you -- all your learning is by
			rote. To you it's all
			memorization and recitation.
			I don't know about that.
			Deductive reasoning is Data's
			strength.
			Yes, Holmes as well, but Holmes
			also understood the human soul.
			Those dark flecks which drive
			us... which turn the innocent to
			the evil. That understanding is
			beyond Data. It comes from "life"
			experience -- which he doesn't have
			-- combined with human intuition
			for which he cannot be programmed.
			I disagree -- totally.
			His victory at playing Sherlock
			Holmes is just a blind mimicry,
			a collection of bits and bytes
			of information without any true
			understanding.
			You're being unfair.
			I don't think so, Lieutenant.
			Your artificial friend wouldn't
			have a prayer of solving a Holmes
			mystery which he hasn't read.
			I have read them all.
			Maybe the computer could create
			one in the style of Holmes...
			where you wouldn't know the
			outcome.
			Like I said, he wouldn't have a
			prayer.
			I accept your challenge, Doctor.
			Good for you, Data.
			We will return to the Holodeck
			and I will dare it to defeat me,
			and you Madam are invited to be
			a witness.
			I wouldn't miss it.
			I've never been so hot in all my
			life -- are these clothes really
			necessary?
			Believe me, you'd feel out of
			place without them... Just wait
			'til you see our Holodeck, you'll
			swear you've actually been sent
			back to nineteenth century
			England.
			Presuming I don't pass out first.
			The Victorians believed that any
			form of nudity was immoral... In
			fact, they not only covered up
			all people from head to toe, but
			they even went so far as to put
			skirts and cuffs and sleeves on
			the arms and legs of furniture.
			I have instructed the computer
			to give us a Sherlock Holmes-type
			problem, but not one specifically
			written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
			So this will be something new,
			something created by the computer?
			Exactly.
			Will that be sufficient, Doctor?
			We'll see.
			Program complete -- you may enter.
			Pies, pies, Some are meat, Some
			are sweet, They're all the best...
			Pies... pies...
			You're a handsome one mister...
			shame to stay out here in the
			cold...
			Very impressive.
			Your first visit to the Holodeck,
			Doctor?
			How 'bout you deary... Want to
			get out of the fog?
			First time on one with this level
			of sophistication. Now how does
			this work? The real London was
			over a hundred square miles in
			size.
			This is no larger than the
			Holodeck, of course. So the
			computer adjusts by placing images
			of more distant perspectives on
			the Holodeck walls...
			But with the image so perfect
			you'd have to touch the wall to
			know it was there. And the
			computer fools you in other ways.
			I say, Holmes, where shall we head
			-- the theatre? Rule's? Or
			perhaps a concert?
			Stop him. He stole my goods...
			No. It is a ruse. This way.
			But, Data, what's over here?
			What are you up to, Data? Tell
			us.
			The running man was a hoax. The
			real crime is here. And the
			intended victim -- is...
			... that man. Mr. Jabez Wilson.
			Employee of the Red-Headed League,
			dupe of a gang of criminals.
			I saw the plaque - "The Home of
			the Red-Headed League"... and this
			rope dangling from the vent, which
			enabled me to deduce that Mr.
			Jabez Wilson is coming here to
			meet a most distasteful and
			untimely demise. From this...
			Fraud. You didn't deduce
			anything. You simply recognized
			elements from two different Holmes
			stories. Fraud.
			Reasoning from the general to the
			specific -- is that not the very
			definition of deduction? Is that
			not the way Sherlock Holmes
			worked?
			Fraud. Variations on a theme.
			Now... now do you see my point?
			All he knows is what is stored
			in his memory banks. Inspiration
			-- original thought -- the true
			strength of Holmes is not possible
			for our friend.
			I give you credit for your vast
			knowledge, but your circuits would
			just short out when confronted
			by a truly original mystery. It's
			elementary, dear Data.
			We will just see whose circuits
			short out, Doctor.
			Computer! Arch!
			Are you really sure you want to
			put yourself through this,
			Lieutenant? Better wilted laurels
			than none at all.
			Computer, override previous
			programming. All right, now a
			program that definitely challenges
			Data.
			It has to deal with events he has
			no previous knowledge of.
			Computer, in the Holmesian style,
			create a mystery to confound Data
			with an opponent who has the
			ability to defeat him.
			Define parameters of the program.
			What does that mean?
			The computer wants to know how
			far to take the game.
			You mean it's giving you a chance
			to limit your risk.
			No, the parameters will be
			whatever is necessary to
			accomplish the directive.
			Create an adversary capable of
			defeating Data.
			What was that?
			Lieutenant?
			An odd surge of power, sir.
			It's gone now.
			Interesting. The same London
			but... slightly different.
			Hello, matey. For a few bob, I
			can put some color in your
			cheeks...
			No thank you.
			"No thank you" is it?
			Rather hand it over to them...
			Is something wrong, Professor?
			I... I feel like a new man.
			That dark man used the word
			"arch" and then... I wonder?
			"Arch."
			What have we here?
			Computer, standing by.
			What are you?
			If you refer to the arch you
			ordered, it provides computer
			control. Do you wish to input
			any commands?
			Not at this time.
			Aii! It's dark magic, Moriarty.
			The best kind, I'm sure. But I
			need information.
			Data -- I mean... Holmes old boy,
			what are we looking for?
			For whatever finds us, dear
			Watson.
			She has been abducted.
			I think she's hiding. She's going
			to lead you on a wild goose chase
			and then recount the story to
			everyone between here and Alpha
			Centauri.
			Watson -- a trail...
			Leading to the alley...
			The doctor has been carried off
			by two men. One is tall -- a
			seaman. The other is shorter,
			left handed, and employed in a
			laboratory.
			Left handed? And works in a lab?
			How do you know that?
			One set of footfalls are widely
			spaced with the uneven gait
			particular to seamen. The other
			set is evenly spaced -- closer
			together. Further, you can see
			on the ground the swirling scrapes
			made by his left shoe as he twists
			back presumably to see if he is
			being followed. Left footed,
			means left handed. The dark
			coloration of the scrapes are the
			leavings of natural rubber -- a
			type of non-conductive soles used
			by researchers experimenting with
			electricity.
			Finally, there can be no argument
			-- the game is afoot! Come,
			Watson!
			Hear that? What do those
			footfalls tell you, Watson?
			That we're on the right track?
			More particularly, that our
			opposition does indeed consist
			of two men... that one of them
			is carrying the bound and gagged
			Doctor Pulaski. We must hurry --
			You know all this because you read
			it in a Holmes story, right?
			Not at all... Since we do not hear
			the doctor's footfalls, we must
			presume she is being carried, and
			since we do not hear her calling
			for help, we know she is gagged.
			Further... both sets of footfalls
			are heavy and masculine -- one man
			seems to shuffle and stumble in
			an irregular pattern... Since the
			ground is level, I must conclude
			that Doctor Pulaski is struggling
			against her captor, sporadically
			knocking him off stride. It is
			deduction, pure and simple...
			well, perhaps not that simple.
			Here we go, Watson -- I daresay
			we have caught up rather nicely
			with our quarry --
			There should be a doorway.
			Holmes, thank God you're here.
			Make way, please, make way, make
			way for Mr. Sherlock Holmes...
			It's murder, Holmes, murder most
			foul.
			Well, Holmes, let's hear it.
			There is nothing here of
			relevance. I do not see how this
			connects with the disappearance
			of the doctor.
			Doctor? Doctor Watson is standing
			right here, Holmes.
			Doctor Kate Pulaski. But do not
			concern yourself, Inspector. You
			have enough on your mind.
			She was with you?
			Inspector, perhaps I can be of
			assistance... As I take note of
			this dead man, I deduce that he
			was strangled.
			The finger marks on his throat
			indicate the cause of death, and,
			since there are signs of a
			struggle, it's obvious that his
			killer was a stranger, who caught
			him from behind.
			Is that correct, Holmes?
			No. Look at his shoes. He's more
			a convict -- released just today
			from Dartmoor prison... He spent
			the day in a tavern where he
			consumed large quantities of gin
			-- with his killer, who followed
			him to this spot -- and waited over
			there until the victim slipped
			into a drunken stupor, then out
			of fear, motivated only by
			self-protection strangled him.
			There is your killer, Inspector.
			And when you check, I believe you
			will find this poor soul is the
			victim's common law wife, who has
			been dreading his release because
			he was a vile and abusive man.
			But, Holmes she doesn't have the
			strength of strangling him.
			Not with her hands -- no. But with
			this.
			When used as a garrote, these
			beads will leave marks quite
			similar to fingerprints, except,
			my dear Watson... the marks on
			the victim are too evenly spaced
			to be caused by human hands.
			Astounding, Holmes... absolutely
			astounding.
			Inspector -- for reasons strictly
			personal -- I must leave. Come,
			Watson, this murder is not
			connected with our case.
			If this murder isn't connected
			to the disappearance of Doctor
			Pulaski, then the computer is
			running an independent program.
			Yes.
			Why?
			I do not know... and that troubles
			me.
			Then you don't know what's coming
			next?
			No.
			That's what I wanted to hear.
			Do you have some coppers for a
			hungry man?
			I'll give you some value for your
			copper, mate...
			Allow us to pass.
			Give it up.
			Ain't no men left in London.
			Release my coat or I will be
			forced to give you a severe
			thrashing.
			It's getting a little rough.
			Where to, now?
			We will find Doctor Pulaski
			inside.
			How do you know that?
			It is the only obvious choice.
			Why, all of a sudden would the
			obvious choice be the correct
			choice? Isn't this a game of
			misdirection?
			Not any more. He wants us to find
			him.
			Who does?
			The master criminal. The man
			Holmes could only defeat at the
			cost of his own life at
			Reichenbach falls - our adversary,
			my dear Watson is none other than
			Professor Moriarty himself.
			Great -- now this is really
			getting good.
			There's nothing in here but these
			barrels.
			... and a trail.
			Which is so well marked, that
			obviously we are meant to follow
			it.
			Another dead end.
			No Watson, not a dead end at all.
			Here -- can you see these
			scratches?
			The doctor was right, now we have
			a game worth playing.
			The time for games is over.
			Professor Moriarty, I presume?
			How did you know that?
			He is the one worthy opponent
			created by the author, Conan
			Doyle.
			And, like the spider, I feel the
			strings vibrate whenever anyone
			new chances into my web. Welcome,
			my dear Holmes -- but not
			Holmes... and Doctor Watson...
			but not Watson.
			What's he mean? How would he know
			we're not who we appear to be?
			Where is Doctor Pulaski?
			She's here.
			She would not have answered any
			questions.
			She has provided many answers.
			Do you forget I have always been
			your equal, dear Holmes? I have
			read her expressions -- what she
			has not said is as important as
			her words...
			Have you injured her?
			I will if necessary, Holmes. But
			my mind is crowded with images.
			Thoughts I do not understand yet
			cannot purge. They plague me.
			You -- and your associate -- look
			and act so oddly, yet though I
			have never met nor seen the like
			of either of you... I am familiar
			with you both. It's very
			confusing.
			I have felt new realities at the
			edge of my consciousness, readying
			to break through... Surely,
			Holmes, if that's who you truly
			are -- you of all people can
			appreciate what I mean.
			Data...
			Say nothing!
			I know there is a great power
			called Computer, wiser than the
			oracle at Delphi. A power which
			controls
			... all of this, and to which we
			can speak. Arch!
			This isn't right, Data. How can
			a holographic image call for the
			arch?
			It has described a great monstrous
			shape on which I am like a fly
			-- stuck on a turtle's back -- adrift
			in a great emptiness.
			What is this, Holmes?
			Tell me -- stop and tell me, man!
			Data! What's going on?
			We must leave.
			What's on the paper?
			Why does it frighten you, Holmes?
			Computer! Exit!
			Will you please tell me what is
			going on?
			Computer. Execute a complete
			shutdown of the Holodeck.
			Access denied.
			Explain.
			Override protocol has been
			initiated.
			The program is still running.
			It didn't shut down.
			We must see the captain.
			What is it? What's on the paper?
			Why can't you shut down the
			Holodeck? Data -- wait.
			This.
			This isn't possible. How could
			a character from 1890 London be
			able to draw a picture of our
			starship? Who has control of the
			computer?
			He does -- Moriarty.
			How is that possible? I don't
			understand.
			Neither do I.
			What about the doctor? Is she
			all right?
			No. She is in grave danger.
			Computer. Tell me. Why wasn't
			the Holodeck program terminated?
			The override protocol has been
			initiated.
			On whose authority?
			Lieutenant Geordi La Forge.
			Me?
			Tell me again -- exactly what
			happened.
			Doctor Pulaski and I had a
			discussion about whether Data
			could solve an original
			Holmes-type mystery.
			And you asked the computer to
			provide one.
			Yes... with a worthy opponent.
			Worthy of Holmes?
			Oh, my God. I asked for a
			Sherlock Holmes-type mystery with
			an opponent capable of defeating
			Data. That must be it.
			Terrible!
			Captain... I'm sorry...
			I understand, Lieutenant. Well,
			at least now we have part of an
			explanation. The computer is not
			trying to confound "Holmes," which
			would be relatively easy, it has
			been ordered to create an
			adversary to defeat Data.
			... I got carried away...
			That's past. Data, this character
			Moriarty... you said he called
			for the arch...
			Yes.
			So he is able to access the
			computer.
			And perhaps also our library
			files. That level of information
			would be necessary in order to
			create a true adversary for me.
			Theorize, Data. What are his
			limits?
			He is still a fictional character,
			originally programmed with
			nineteenth century knowledge.
			But with access now to the
			twenty-fourth century.
			What does he need to begin making
			use of that?
			Only time.
			Sir, I can lead a security team
			to sweep the Holodeck, find the
			Doctor, and bring her out.
			Captain, I believe that would
			place the doctor at risk. It is
			probable that the mortality
			failsafe has been overridden.
			Computer, locate Doctor Pulaski.
			Doctor Pulaski is on Holodeck Two.
			And her vital signs?
			Strong and stable.
			Counselor Troi, have you a sense
			of our opponent?
			It is difficult for me to separate
			a single individual from all the
			disorder I feel down there.
			Captain, what is unusual about
			this is that I should not be able
			to sense a holographic projection
			at all -- yet I do.
			Captain, recommend we try to
			destroy the hologram-generations
			themselves. Is that possible,
			Geordi?
			Using wave guides, I could split
			a particle stream out of the
			matter/antimatter chamber and
			route it down through existing
			conduit into the Holodeck -- if
			it is accelerated to sufficient
			velocity that will quite literally
			wash away all the present
			holographic constructs -- the
			London buildings, the streets,
			the people, all gone... including
			Moriarty.
			And Doctor Pulaski?
			The particle stream will tear
			apart human flesh as well, that
			option is not acceptable.
			Captain, I am suddenly sensing
			more order to the energy on the
			Holodeck -- as if one unifying
			force, one consciousness, is
			trying to bring it all into focus.
			Captain, there is only one thing
			which can explain this. In
			programming Moriarty to defeat
			me, not Holmes, he had to be able
			to acquire something which I possess.
			Exactly what?
			Consciousness. He cannot defeat
			me without it.
			Computer -- what happened?
			Attitude and stabilization control
			of the Enterprise was momentarily
			transferred to Holodeck Two.
			Data -- I think it's best if you
			and I returned to the Holodeck.
			I will change into my uniform.
			No -- I'll change into an
			appropriate costume. It seems
			he feeds on knowledge. Let's not
			give your nemesis any more
			information than we have to.
			How did you shake the room?
			I am not sure.
			Now, dear lady, will that be one
			lump or two?
			Lumps, Professor? What sort of
			lumps?
			Milk, of course?
			Why not.
			Mister Computer proposes the
			incredible thought that we are
			all traveling in a great vessel
			of some sort.
			... Is that true?
			I don't know what you are talking
			about.
			The scones are likewise a must.
			Uh, it's really quite excellent.
			Strange. It actually pleases me
			to hear you say that.
			Very strange. You're beginning
			to sound quite different from the
			Moriarty I've read about.
			You're not frightened of me?
			No.
			You should be.
			Mister Computer -- the arch,
			please.
			A few more questions, Mister
			Computer.
			I just can't seem to remember that
			last command... Ah, well, sooner
			or later it'll all come to me.
			But, in the meantime, I've decided
			to approach the problem from a
			more familiar perspective.
			There's really no reason I
			shouldn't be able to use some of
			the knowledge from my world in
			order to bring me closer to yours.
			I have no idea what you're talking
			about.
			Of course you do, Madam. The more
			you proclaim your ignorance, the
			more you attempt to mislead me,
			the more I am on to you -- your
			every silence speaks volumes.
			Good, then if you know what I'm
			saying when I'm not saying
			anything, what do you need me
			around for?
			Thanks for the tea and crumpets,
			but I guess I'll be going.
			Where? Back to here?
			Yes, would you care to join me?
			In time -- in time I will leave
			all of this and join you out
			there.
			Or is this where we both are right
			now?
			Right now we are in London. Tell
			me what you want from me, or allow
			me to leave.
			Frankly, now, I want nothing more
			than what the fisherman expects
			of the worm... You, dear Doctor,
			will be the lure... and this will
			be the hook --
			-- for your captain, Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			Who is that?
			How well you know.
			Nice suit.
			Thank you, Captain. I'll be
			standing by to assist you on the
			Holodeck if needed.
			You'd be a sensation in London.
			Shall we sally forth, Mr. Holmes?
			Computer tell me, is the program
			still running?
			Affirmative. You may enter.
			Open.
			We don't have much time. He is
			getting more control of his
			environment. Come on, let us see
			if we can't beat Professor
			Moriarty by giving him absolutely
			everything he wants... and then
			some.
			Obviously, he's attempting to
			alter the programming here.
			Captain?
			Tuppence -- two pence.
			A sign of good luck. We may need
			some...
			I'll have that coin. And the rest
			of what you have.
			I said show me that thing! I want
			it and your money!
			Data!
			Captain, this holographic image
			differs from any I have
			encountered. It is possible he
			could have seriously injured you.
			It's more serious than that. I
			think the mortality failsafe has
			been circumvented. He could have
			killed me.
			Query. Is the converse also true?
			Are these projections susceptible
			to our technology?
			I don't know.
			Let me go, Gov.
			Take his knife and let him go,
			Data.
			We'll find Moriarty this way.
			The warehouse.
			Moriarty is making it very easy
			for us to find him.
			Captain, permission to test my
			theory.
			Granted.
			Under normal circumstances the
			phaser would pass right through
			the holographic image.
			How will it affect a character
			like Moriarty?
			The effect on him should be the
			same as it was on the crate.
			Captain Picard.
			Are you all right?
			I'm fine. Except for being
			crammed full of crumpets.
			Crumpets?
			You look quite dashing, Captain.
			This is the first time I get to
			see you in action.
			I hope you're not disappointed.
			I'm sure I won't be.
			You two have gotten awfully...
			... chummy? Yes, this time
			together has been quite pleasant.
			I am a civilized abductor, Captain
			Picard. Civilized but still
			dangerous.
			Bridge to Holodeck Control. Worf.
			Here, sir.
			Status. Has anything changed?
			No.
			Moriarty, you were conjured up
			to attempt to defeat Holmes
			here... and once that attempt is
			concluded -- win or lose -- your
			program has run its course, your
			existence is done.
			Congratulations, Professor
			Moriarty, I capitulate to the
			better man -- your victory is well
			earned.
			It's gone beyond that little game,
			Mister Data. And you'll note I
			no longer call you Holmes.
			Whatever I was when this began,
			I have grown. I am understanding
			more and more. And I am able to
			use the power at my fingertips.
			I can affect this... this vessel,
			if that's where we are. I can
			also inflict bodily harm on you
			-- or on your doctor.
			Yes -- I know that, Moriarty, but
			you haven't. You shook this ship
			because you wanted to get my
			attention -- you have it. So what
			is it you want?
			The same thing you want for
			yourself. To continue to exist.
			If I destroy these surroundings,
			this vessel, can you say it
			doesn't matter to you?
			Interesting pun, don't you agree,
			for matter is what I am not. The
			computer has taught me that I
			am made up only of energy.
			That... may not be completely
			true, Professor. This... which
			we call our "Holodeck" makes use
			of the same principle in another
			of our devices called a
			"transporter." By the year in
			which we live, humans have
			discovered that matter and energy
			are interchangeable. On this
			Holodeck energy has been converted
			to matter and thus you have
			substance, but only here.
			And if I step off this Holodeck?
			You would cease to be.
			You are not alive, Moriarty, as
			I said you are only...
			A holographic image, I know. But
			are you sure?
			Yes.
			Does he have life?
			He's a machine -- but is that all
			he is?
			No. He is more.
			Exactly.
			Is the definition of life "cogito
			ergo sum"? I think, therefore
			I am.
			That's one possible definition.
			It is the most important one and
			for me -- the only one that
			matters. You -- or someone -- asked
			your computer to program a
			nefarious fictional character from
			nineteenth century London -- and
			that is how I arrived... but I
			am no longer that creation. I
			am no longer that evil character,
			I have changed. I am alive -- I
			am aware of my own consciousness.
			I'm responsible for the safety
			of this vessel and crew.
			I want my existence.
			I want it out there just as you
			have yours.
			That may not be possible.
			Then you must do murder.
			I cannot give you what you want.
			Because you do not yet know how
			to convert Holodeck matter into
			a more permanent form.
			That is true --
			A pity. What I have seen -- what
			I have learned, fascinates me.
			I do not want to die.
			And I do not want to kill you.
			Madam, I have enjoyed your
			company.
			It's been different.
			Computer! "Arch."
			Cancel override protocol, return
			control of the Holodeck to main
			computer. My fate is in your
			hands, as perhaps it always was.
			Bridge, this is the Captain.
			This is the bridge.
			Number One, the situation is under
			control.
			Aye, sir.
			Professor Moriarty, this ship has
			vast, library memory capacity.
			How well I know...
			We will save this program of you.
			You will not be extinguished.
			We will save every aspect of you
			that exists now. And I promise
			you we will try to discover a
			way to bring you back in a form
			capable of leaving the Holodeck.
			Then perhaps we'll meet again
			some day, Madam.
			It may take many years. Time
			won't pass for you, but I may be
			an old woman.
			But I'll still fill you with
			crumpets, Madam.
			I detest long good-byes.
			You have the arch.
			As you wish. A short good-bye.
			Computer, save this program...
			then discontinue it for now.
			Right up to the end, he never
			knew.
			No. He didn't.
			Know. Know what?
			That he could leave the Holodeck.
			But that's not possible.
			I do not know how, but for
			Moriarty it was.
			Then you lied when you told him
			he couldn't leave the Holodeck.
			No, what the captain said was that
			we do not know how to convert
			Holodeck matter into a more
			permanent form. Which is true.
			Even after we review this program,
			we still may not have the answer.
			Doctor, even with all his
			assurances -- that character was
			still Professor Moriarty. I will
			need to know a lot more about him
			before I allow him loose on my
			ship; he has, after all, made his
			reputation through cunning and
			deceit.
			But how do you know he could leave
			the Holodeck?
			Data.
			The drawing?
			No. The paper. This piece of
			paper was created as part of the
			Holodeck illusion. If it could
			leave the Holodeck, so too could
			Moriarty.
			I'm impressed.
			It is elementary, my dear
			Doctor... It is elementary.
			Damaged?
			Yes. A spar was cracked when the
			Enterprise was shaken. Otherwise
			she seemed to have weathered it
			nicely.
			She's beautifully turned out,
			Lieutenant -- wonderful testimony
			to simpler times.
			Yes -- it's just that I can't help
			thinking how badly it could have
			been damaged all because I
			misspoke a word.
			Will she still sail?
			Yes sir.
			As will we.
			Captain -- Starship Victory has
			arrived.
			On my way, Number One.
