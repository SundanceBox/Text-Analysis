			Hot chocolate, please.
			We don't ordinarily say "please"
			to food dispensers.
			Since it's listed as "intelligent
			Circuitry", why not? After all,
			working as much with artificial
			intelligence as we do, can be
			dehumanizing -- right? So, maybe
			we can combat that tendency with
			a little simple courtesy.
			Thank you.
			For someone who has just arrived,
			you certainly aren't shy with your
			opinions.
			Ooops -- have I been talking too
			much?
			No.
			I do tend to be a motor mouth,
			especially when I get excited...
			and you don't know how exciting
			it is to get this assignment.
			Everyone in class -- and I mean
			everyone -- wants the Enterprise.
			I mean, it would have been all
			right to spend some time on Ranuos
			Six to do phase work with
			anti-matter... that's my
			speciality.
			I know -- that's why you got this
			assignment.
			Did it again. It's just that...
			I know, you're excited. Sonya.
			Yes.
			I don't think you want to bring
			that hot chocolate around these
			control stations.
			Sorry. I shouldn't even have this
			in engineering. We were talking
			and I just forgot I had it in my
			hand...
			I'll finish it over here.
			Lieutenant La Forge, it won't
			happen again.
			Actually it's my fault, sir...
			Yes, I'm aware of how often you
			order picnics to be held in here.
			Oh no. Oh, Captain... I'm
			sorry... oh..
			... I wasn't looking and...
			Oh.. It's all over you.
			Yes, Ensign. It's all over me.
			At least let me...
			Ensign... ah...
			Ensign Sonya Gomez.
			Ensign Gomez is a recent Academy
			graduate. She transferred on at
			Starbase one seventy three.
			Ensign...
			I think it would be simpler if
			you let me change my uniform?
			Captain, I really have to accept
			responsibility for this.
			Yes, Chief Engineer. I believe
			I do understand now.
			I'm very excited about this
			assignment Captain, and I promise
			I'll...
			... try very hard to serve you and
			this ship to the best of my
			ability.
			I'm sure you will. Carry on.
			First impressions right. Isn't
			that what they say -- first
			impressions are the most
			important.
			I'll give you this... it's a
			meeting the captain won't soon
			forget.
			What a way to start my first
			assignment.
			Deck nine. Officers' quarters.
			Crewman? What's going on?
			There, there, my dear captain.
			Q.
			My, my -- haven't we been careless.
			There -- a little cleaning service.
			I am more than happy to provide.
			We agreed you would never trouble
			my ship again!
			I always keep my arrangements,
			sir. We are nowhere near your
			vessel.
			I read your graduating thesis.
			I wouldn't have requested you if
			you weren't the best.
			Where are we going?
			To Ten-Forward. We're going to
			forget about work. We are going
			to sit, talk, relax, look at the
			stars. You're going to learn to
			slow down.
			No, that's the one thing I can't
			do.
			You're awfully young to be so
			driven.
			Yes, I am. I had to be. I had
			to be the best because only the
			best get to be here. Out here
			on the edge.
			Geordi, Geordi . . .uh . .
			Lieutenant --
			Geordi
			Geordi. Whatever is out here
			we're going to be the first
			humans ever to see it. And is
			it here because we believe in
			it and have therefore created
			it, or has it created us?
			The Grand Unified Theory and
			Supersymmetry hasn't been
			seriously discussed for years.
			They also haven't been disproved.
			I don't know if it's true or
			not, but I've got to try and find
			out.
			You're more than a scientist
			you're a philospher.
			No, no, I'm not. Oh, God, don't
			make me sound profound. There's
			just so much out there ... here.
			I have to see it all. To
			understand it all, and we haven't
			got much time.
			Sonya, it's going to be there for
			you. Believe me.
			I promise, I won't let anything
			exciting slip past without letting
			you know.
			I understand that you're excited
			-- so was I. This is your first
			assignment, everything is new,
			you are eager and that's great,
			but...
			I've always been an enthusiastic
			person, but...
			Do me a favor... for a minute,
			just listen.
			I always do that. Someone nice
			-- and you are nice I can tell,
			goes out of their way to give me
			some helpful advice... and I'm
			so busy talking...
			Not another word. Go ahead...
			talk.
			Bridge, this is Ten-Forward.
			Guinan?! I don't believe you've
			ever called the bridge before.
			I've never felt the need. Is
			everything alright?
			How do you mean?
			Is there... anything... unusual
			happening?
			Anyone notice anything unusual?
			No Guinan, nothing out of the
			ordinary. Why do you ask?
			I'm... I'm not certain. Just a
			feeling -- something that happened
			once before. Probably nothing.
			Please forget I called. Ten-
			Forward out.
			The locator beacon won't help.
			They'll never look for you this
			far away.
			Enterprise -- this is Picard.
			Stop this foolishness, Q. Return
			me to the Enterprise.
			I'd suggest you change your
			attitude. Petulance does not
			become you. We have business.
			Keeping me a prisoner out here
			will not force me to discuss
			anything with you.
			It will in time, my dear Captain.
			I appreciate your advice,
			Lieutenant. And, I'll take it
			to heart.
			Guinan?
			Can I get you something?
			No -- we're fine. Is everything
			all right?
			I don't know.
			I think I'll go check out
			Engineering.
			I'll go with you.
			Where's the captain?
			In his Ready Room.
			Captain -- this is Counselor Troi.
			Computer -- locate Captain Picard.
			The captain is not on the ship.
			Commander, there is a shuttle
			missing from Shuttle Bay Two.
			All stop.
			Answering all stop.
			I have hailed the shuttle on all
			frequencies -- no response.
			Sensors indicate no shuttle or
			other ships in this sector.
			We must assume the captain is
			onboard the shuttle.
			But, how could he get to the
			shuttle bay, how could he leave
			the Enterprise without us knowing?
			It's not possible.
			Take it easy, Wes. We'll find
			him. I want to begin a methodical
			search. Sensors on maximum scan
			We'll use our present location
			as the center. Data plot a search
			pattern from our present
			coordinates which will cover the
			most area in the shortest time.
			The search pattern has been input.
			Engage, Mister Crusher.
			First officer's log. Stardate
			(xx). We have not been able to
			determine why, or how, Captain
			Picard left the Enterprise. We
			can't even be certain he is in
			the missing shuttle, although that
			is the assumption on which we are
			proceeding. For the last six
			hours we have been searching
			without success.
			We have covered the area in a
			spherical pattern which a vessel
			without warp drive could traverse
			in the time allotted.
			Widen the area...
			Do we stay out here years?
			Decades? Picard, I am ageless
			-- you are not.
			Then the Enterprise will continue
			on with Riker as captain. Return
			me to my ship.
			You are an impossibly stubborn
			human.
			If I return you to your ship, you
			will agree to give my request a
			full hearing?
			You're right Picard. This is the
			proper venue for our discussion.
			Commander. My status board
			indicates that the shuttle is back
			in Shuttle Bay Two.
			Computer -- locate Captain Picard.
			Captain Picard is in Ten-Forward.
			You!
			None other.
			Picard, if you had half the sense
			you pretend to have, you would
			get her off your ship immediately
			-- and if you like I will be more
			than pleased to expedite her
			departure.
			You know him.
			We had some dealings.
			Those dealings were two centuries
			ago. This creature is not what
			she appears to be. She's an imp
			-- where she goes trouble always
			follows.
			You're speaking of yourself, Q
			-- not Guinan.
			Guinan? Is that your name now?
			Guinan's not the issue here -- you
			are... We had an agreement that
			you would stop meddling with us.
			And so I have.
			What do you want, Q? State your
			business and let's get on with
			it.
			I agree Captain, enough about this
			creature -- she's diverting us from
			the purpose of my being here.
			Which is?
			Ahh, the redoubtable Commander
			Riker. And micro-brain.
			Growl for me -- let me know you
			still care.
			My purpose? Why to join you.
			To join us as what?
			A member of the crew. Willing
			and able -- ready to serve.
			This ship is already home for the
			indigent, the unwanted and the
			unworthy -- so why not a homeless
			entity.
			Homeless?
			Yes.
			So, the other members of the Q
			continuum kicked you out.
			Not all of the Q are like this
			one. Some are almost respectable.
			Join us as what? To do what?
			Would you start as an ordinary
			crewman -- what task is too menial
			for an entity?
			Do you mock me?
			Not at all. That is the last
			thing I would do. You, by
			definition are part of our
			charter. Our mission is to go
			forth -- to seek out new and
			different life forms, and you
			certainly qualify as one of the
			most unique life forms I have
			ever encountered. To learn more
			about you is frankly quite
			provocative, but you are next
			of kin to chaos.
			Captain, at least allow me to
			present my argument.
			After our last encounter,
			I was asked to leave the Q
			continuum. Since then, I have been
			wandering vaguely -- bored really
			-- my existence without purpose.
			Then, I remembered the good times
			I had with you...
			The good times!? The first time
			we met you put us on trial for
			the "crimes of humanity"...
			Of which you were exonerated.
			The next time we saw you, you
			asked me to join the Q continuum.
			You made a large mistake in not
			accepting my offer.
			... and now you say you want to
			join us.
			Yes, more and more I realize that
			here -- here is where I want to
			be. Think of the advantages.
			Now, I neither expect nor require
			any special treatment. If
			necessary, although I can't
			imagine why, I will renounce my
			powers and become as weak and
			incompetent as all of you.
			No.
			Oh, come on, Captain, in
			fairness... let me try, I deserve
			at least that much.
			Fairness?! You disrupt this ship
			-- kidnap the captain!
			I add a little excitement, a
			little spice to your lives and
			all you do is complain. Where's
			your adventurous spirit -- your
			imagination. Think, Picard, of
			the possibilities.
			Simply stated -- we don't trust
			you.
			Oh, you may not trust me, but you
			do need me. You're not prepared
			for what awaits you.
			I don't know that we are prepared,
			but I do know that we are ready
			to confront it.
			Really?
			Absolutely. That's why we are
			out here.
			Oh, the arrogance.
			They don't have a clue about
			what's "out here".
			They will learn -- adapt. That's
			their great advantage.
			They are moving faster than
			expected -- farther than they
			should.
			By whose calculation?
			You judge yourselves against the
			pitiful adversaries you have so
			far encountered -- the Klingons,
			the Romulans, are nothing compared
			to what's waiting.
			Picard, you are about to move into
			areas of the galaxy containing
			wonders more incredible than you
			can possibly imagine... and
			terrors to freeze your soul. I
			offer myself as guide -- only to
			be rejected out-of-hand.
			I guess we'll just have to get
			along the best we can without you.
			What justifies this smugness?
			We're not smug -- nor arrogant.
			We are resolute and we are
			willing. But more than that we
			are determined. Your help is not
			required.
			Well, let's just see how ready
			you are.
			Q -- don't do this!
			Bridge this is the captain -- all
			stop.
			Answering all stop.
			Status.
			According to these coordinates
			we have traveled seven thousand light
			years, and are located near system
			J-two-five.
			Estimate travel time to the
			closest starbase.
			At maximum warp, in two years,
			seven months, three days, eighteen
			hours we would reach Starbase one
			eight five.
			Why?
			Why? Why, to give you a taste
			of your future. This is a
			preview of things to come, because
			if you continue at your present
			rate of exploration -- very soon you
			will reach this part of the
			galaxy.
			Con permiso, Capitan. The hall
			has been rented -- the orchestra
			engaged -- it's time to see if you
			can dance.
			Guinan, have your people been in
			this part of the galaxy?
			Yes.
			What can you tell us?
			Only that if I were you, I'd start
			back right now.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			entity Q has flung the Enterprise
			to a distant part of the galaxy,
			which we are going to take the
			opportunity to explore.
			Captain, the sixth planet in the
			system is Class M.
			There is a system of roads on the
			planet which indicate a highly
			industrialized civilization. But
			where there should be cities there
			are only great rips in the
			surface.
			It is as though some great force
			just scooped all machine elements
			off the face of the planet.
			It is identical to what happened
			to the outposts along the Neutral
			Zone.
			We are being probed.
			What's the source of the probe?
			A ship. It is on an intercept
			course.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Full scan. Go to Yellow Alert.
			Going to Yellow Alert.
			Keep the shields down -- we don't
			want to appear provocative.
			Data, what can you tell us?
			The ship is strangely generalized
			in design. There is no specific
			bridge or central control area,
			no specific engineering section
			-- I can identify no living
			quarters.
			Life signs?
			There is no indication of specific
			life.
			Lieutenant Worf, what is its alert
			status?
			I detect no shields, no weapons
			of any known design.
			Hailing frequencies.
			Open.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			of the USS Enterprise.
			No response.
			Guinan.
			Activate your viewscreen -- I want
			you to monitor what's going on
			up here. I may need your input.
			I'm here. I can see the other
			ship.
			You are acquainted with this life
			form?
			Yes. My people encountered them
			a century ago. Our cities were
			destroyed -- our people scattered
			across the galaxy. They are
			called the Borg -- protect yourself
			or they will destroy you.
			Shields up.
			Yes, sir.
			Security to Main Engineering -- we
			have an intruder.
			He came right through the shields!
			Interesting isn't it? Not a he
			-- not a she. Not like anything
			you've ever seen. An enhanced
			humanoid.
			What do you want?
			We mean you no harm. Do you
			understand me?
			Understand you? You are nothing
			to him. He has no interest in
			your life form. He's just a
			scout -- the first of many. He's
			here to analyze as much about you
			as he can -- that's how they always
			start.
			He may attempt to gain control
			of the ship. I wouldn't let him.
			Stop -- we cannot allow you to
			interfere with the operation of
			this ship.
			Lieutenant Worf.
			Worf -- use whatever means to
			neutralize the intruder.
			Because her people had contact
			with the Borg, I have requested
			that Guinan participate in this
			conference. You are aware of
			what just occurred in Main
			Engineering.
			Tell, us exactly what happened
			between your people and the Borg.
			I was not personally invloved,
			but -- from what I have been told
			they came through our system like
			a storm of Jaradan Aser beatles
			-- and by the time they left,
			there wasn't much left of our
			society.
			Guinan, if they are that
			aggressive, then I wonder why
			neither Borg attacked? They could
			have -- but they didn't.
			They never do that as
			individuals. It's just not
			their way. When they decide to
			come, they will come in force.
			They do nothing piecemeal.
			Then the initial encounter was
			solely for the purpose of
			gathering information.
			Yes.
			How do we reason with them? Let
			them know that we are not a
			threat?
			You don't, at least to my
			knowledge nobody has so far.
			Captain, we are being hailed.
			On screen.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			of the...
			We have analyzed your defensive
			capabilities as being unable to
			withstand us. If you defend
			yourselves, you will be punished.
			Counselor.
			You are not dealing with an
			individual mind. They do not have
			a single leader. It is the
			collective minds of all of them.
			That would have some definite
			advantages.
			Yes. A single leader can make
			errors. It is less likely for
			the combined whole.
			Picard.
			Are you certain you still don't
			want me as a member of your crew?
			This would be the time to ask,
			before everything goes too far
			beyond your control.
			Captain -- they have locked onto
			us with some form of tractor beam.
			We're on our way.
			Whatever this beam is, Captain,
			it is draining our shields.
			If they pull down our shields
			we're helpless.
			On any heading -- warp eight
			engage.
			It's holding us here!
			Increase power!
			The shields are weakening.
			In eighteen seconds the shields
			will be down.
			Locate the exact source of the
			tractor beam -- lock on phasers.
			Phasers locked on target.
			Fire.
			They still have us.
			Shields are down.
			A type of laser beam is slicing
			into the Saucer Section.
			They are carving us up like a
			roast.
			With whatever force you need
			terminate that beam.
			Fire!
			The tractor beam has released.
			Damage report.
			Sections twenty-seven, twenty-eight and twenty-
			nine on Decks four, five and six destroyed.
			Casualties?
			Eighteen were in those sections
			and are missing.
			They couldn't have survived it.
			A force field is maintaining hull
			integrity.
			What is the condition of their
			ship?
			They have sustained damage to
			twenty percent of their vessel.
			Life support minimal.
			Why?!
			Conference.
			Worf -- you had better remain at
			your station.
			I am so sorry, Captain.
			Guinan -- what else can you tell
			us about these creatures?
			I only know bits and pieces.
			Anything would be helpful.
			They are a mixture of organic and
			artificial life that has been
			developed over a thousand
			centuries.
			I can't get the shields up.
			Divert power from wherever you
			need it. Anywhere except life
			support.
			It wouldn't help. The circuits
			which control the shields have
			been fused.
			If you can't reprogram them...
			reroute.
			Eighteen people. Dead -- just like
			that.
			Push it out of your head.
			I can't. I keep seeing them.
			Stop it. We'll grieve later.
			Right now... let's get those
			shields operative.
			The Borg is the ultimate user,
			with the result that they are
			unlike any threat your Federation
			has ever faced. They have no
			interest in political conquest
			-- or wealth or power as you know
			it. They simply want your ship
			-- its technology. They have
			identified it as something they
			can consume and use.
			And you brought us here, exposed
			us to it, cost us the lives of
			shipmates...
			Stop -- or you will surely die.
			Number One.
			Eighteen of our people have died.
			Please tell us that this is one
			of your illusions.
			Oh, no. This is as real as your
			"so called" life gets.
			This is Lieutenant La Forge, Captain.
			We have been able to restore power
			to the shields.
			Very good.
			Captain, I have the casuality list
			coming on screen.
			Cancel -- time for that later.
			If there's a chance we are going
			to have further dealings with the
			Borg -- now or in the future -- we
			had better find out as much about
			them as we can.
			Visit their ship?
			In my opinion, we have no choice,
			sir.
			Agreed. Assemble a minimal away
			team and take a look at what's
			over there.
			What?
			Mister Worf. Report to Transporter
			Room 3.
			Data.
			It's not my business but I
			wouldn't go over there if I were
			you.
			Oh, I don't know, Guinan. They
			visited us... seems only fair that
			we return the courtesy.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			We have been attacked without
			provocation by an alien race which
			Guinan calls the Borg. Hopefully,
			we have neutralized their vessel.
			Commander Riker is leading an away
			team in an attempt to learn more
			about them.
			There are no life sign readings.
			I have laid in coordinates which
			should set you down in the least
			damaged section of the Borg ship.
			Set phasers on stun, but let's
			be ready to increase the power
			if we need it.
			Energize.
			I wonder why they don't react to
			us, and why the Enterprise did
			not read any life signs,
			especially when there are this
			many.
			Perhaps because this ship was
			scanned for individual life signs.
			Apparently when they are in these
			slots, they become part of the
			whole and no longer read as
			separate life forms.
			Captain.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			Our readings were incorrect... the
			Borg crew survived, but they are
			in a kind of stasis.
			Explain.
			There are slots along the wall,
			kind of like compartments. There
			are two Borg in each.
			Captain, I would theorize that
			the Borg are somehow
			interconnected through these slots
			and are working collectively.
			We are going to look for some
			way to access their main
			computer.
			Each slot is designed for a
			specific Borg. Here is where the
			connection is made.
			Like a juggernaut which could
			start moving at any moment.
			The technology required to achieve
			this biological and artificial
			interface is far beyond our
			capabilities. There are many
			advantages.
			Speed being the obvious one. This
			ship literally thinks what it
			wants to do and it happens.
			Fascinating. Obviously they also
			function individually.
			And either they don't see us,
			or don't see us as a threat.
			Transporter room, this is the
			Captain.
			O'Brien here Captain.
			If your lock on the away team
			wavers in the slightest -- beam
			them back.
			Count on it, Captain.
			Captain -- this is incredible.
			I have just entered what appears
			to be the nursery.
			Describe it.
			From the looks of it the Borg are
			born as biological life form.
			Almost immediately after birth
			they begin getting artificial
			implants. They have apparently
			developed the technology to link
			artificial intelligence directly
			into a humanoid brain. Pretty
			astounding. Something else -- I
			haven't seen any females.
			Commander.
			What is it?
			The ship appears to be
			regenerating.
			Perhaps this explains why they
			have not taken notice of our
			presence. Their collective effort
			is directed at repairing their
			vessel.
			Captain, the Borg are using their
			combined power to repair the ship.
			Transporter Chief, beam the away
			team directly to the bridge.
			Now, Mister Crusher -- engage.
			Captain -- the Borg ship is in
			pursuit.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Increase by ten to the third.
			It's continuing to regenerate
			itself.
			Let's see if we can outrun it.
			Lietenant La Forge, I want maximum
			warp for as long as you can hold
			it.
			Yes, sir.
			We are passing warp eight point
			five.
			... warp nine.
			Arm the photon torpedoes.
			Recommend we try to slow them
			down.
			Agreed.
			Torpedoes armed.
			Fire.
			What is it? Is there something
			the matter?
			No. You can study the theory -- read
			the books -- analyze
			schematics... but nothing of it
			prepares you for this. I have
			just never see or felt anything
			so awesome.
			Well let's see if we can't raise
			the level a few more knotches.
			They had no effect.
			Bridge, this is Engineering. We
			are at warp nine point six five.
			The Borg ship is still gaining.
			They will follow this ship until
			you exhaust your fuel. They will
			wear down your defenses. Then
			you will be theirs.
			You're out of your league, Picard.
			You should have stayed where you
			belonged.
			Captain's log supplemental. We
			are unable to maintain the gap
			between the Enterprise and the
			Borg ship.
			We are at the design limit.
			Agreed. Bridge this is
			Engineering.
			Go ahead.
			You've got all we can give you.
			I understand, Lieutenant La Forge.
			Captain -- the enemy vessel is
			firing on us.
			There are no reports of any damage
			to the Enterprise.
			The target was not the ship. The
			weapon was designed to drain the
			shields.
			Shield effectiveness has been
			reduced twelve percent.
			The Borg ship is closing.
			They are firing again.
			Shields have been reduced by forty
			one percent. Another hit and we
			will be defenseless.
			They are wearing you down. Soon
			you will be helpless.
			Arm the photon torpedoes.
			Torpedoes armed.
			Fire the photons.
			The Borg ship was not damaged.
			You can't outrun them. You can't
			destroy them. If you damage them,
			the essence of what they are
			remains -- they regenerate and
			keep coming... eventually you
			will weaken -- your reserves will
			be gone... they are relentless.
			The Borg ship is firing.
			We have again lost the shields.
			Bridge -- we have lost the warp
			engines.
			Now where's your smugness -- your
			arrogance? Do you still believe
			you are prepared for what awaits
			you? I tried to tell you but
			listening has never been one of
			your laudable attributes. It
			makes me quite happy to now say
			-- I told you so.
			The Borg ship is re-establishing
			its tractor beam.
			Lock on photon torpedoes.
			Yes, sir.
			Without our shields -- at this
			range there is a high degree of
			probability that a photon
			detonation could destroy the
			Enterprise.
			Prepare to fire.
			I'll be leaving now. You
			thought you could handle it -- so
			handle it.
			Q. End this.
			What makes you think I am either
			inclined or capable to terminate
			this encounter?
			If we all die, here and now -- you
			will never be able to gloat. You
			wanted to frighten us -- we're
			frightened. You wanted to show
			that we are inadequate -- for the
			moment I will grant that. You
			want me to say that I need you.
			Right now -- I need you.
