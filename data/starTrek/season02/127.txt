			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies opened.
			Repulse, this is the Enterprise.
			We are getting underway.
			Acknowledged, Enterprise.
			Transfer complete -- good luck on
			your mission.
			And to you.
			Give my regards to your captain.
			Repulse out.
			The Shuttle Bay is secure.
			Thank you Mister Crusher. Make
			all preparations to get underway.
			We will construct this large
			enclosure on Cargo Deck Five.
			Come.
			The transfer is complete. Doctor
			Pulaski is being shown to her
			quarters. We are ready to get
			underway.
			Very good. Take a look at the
			containment module our new chief
			engineer has designed.
			"Chief engineer," that has a nice
			ring to it.
			It does to me.
			Each will have total atmospheric
			control... temperature, radiation,
			light, humidity, plus electrical
			spectrums.
			And these are put into the large
			containment area?
			Yes, these modules will keep the
			specimens alive -- the large
			containment area will keep us
			alive. Now, I have to go and
			replicate this five hundred and
			twelve times. This will mean
			it will be necessary to divert
			power from the warp engines to
			the replicator.
			How long will we be on impulse
			power?
			For a few hours, but it can't be
			helped.
			When we leave 'aucdet Nine - I'm
			going to want all the power you
			can slam into those warp engines.
			You'll have it.
			I will relieve you at zero three
			zero zero.
			Take us out of orbit, Mister
			Crusher -- set course for 'aucdet
			Nine.
			Aye, sir. Course for 'aucdet Nine
			has been input.
			Maximum impulse velocity.
			Aye, sir.
			Engage.
			Engineering -- this is Science One.
			I just observed what appeared to
			be a random energy transference.
			Where?
			Aft. Outboard of the port
			nacelle.
			Hold on -- I'll check.
			No -- I show nothing here, Data.
			Problem, Commander?
			Possibly. An unexplained power
			fluctuation.
			Let me know if it reoccurs.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1.
			There has been an outbreak of a
			yet unclassified Plasma Plague
			in the densely populated Rachelis
			system. We are on an emergency
			run to a Federation Research
			station on 'aucdet Nine, where
			specimens of Plasma Plague are
			kept. We will then transport that
			deadly cargo to Science Station
			Tango Sierra, where hopefully an
			antidote can be manufactured.
			Every hour we delay, thousands
			die.
			How's it going?
			Finished, just waiting to insert
			the modules.
			Number One.
			Lieutenant La Forge says we will
			be able to engage the warp drive
			within the hour.
			Mister Data, when we receive a
			complete list of all the specimens
			we will be carrying, I want you
			and Doctor Pulaski to go through
			it... by the way. Where is our
			new doctor? Has she reported in?
			Not yet.
			Sickbay, this is the captain.
			Sickbay, aye.
			Is Doctor Pulaski there?
			Ah... no, Sir. The doctor is in
			Ten-Forward.
			What?!
			A few hours on board and she's
			already found Ten-Forward.
			I'll go and get her.
			No, Number One. I'll go.
			Not the best way to meet your new
			captain.
			Hello, Captain.
			Ensign Crusher.
			I'm sorry this mission will delay
			your reunion with your mother.
			It's all right. I can use the
			time to finish some projects.
			We shouldn't be more than a week
			or so.
			It is going to be hard to leave
			the Enterprise...
			Mixed feelings for all of us.
			It's always difficult leaving any
			ship, as it was for your mother
			when she left to become head of
			Starfleet Medical. But going
			from one assignment to another
			is part of the life which you are
			choosing.
			Yes, but this isn't "any" ship.
			Truly.
			Guinan.
			Captain.
			Where's Doctor Pulaski?
			Doctor Katherine Pulaski?
			Ah... you must be Captain
			Picard...
			Doctor -- protocol on your last
			assignment might have been lax,
			but here on the Enterprise...
			Sit down, Captain. You better
			listen to this.
			Lieutenant La Forge, status
			report.
			The containment area is completed,
			the last of the modules are being
			inserted.
			Take us to warp six as soon as
			possible.
			Acknowledged.
			This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski.
			We will handle the formal
			introduction later.
			Counselor Deanna Troi is
			pregnant.
			A baby!
			This is a surprise.
			More so for me.
			This pregnancy is unlike anything
			I have ever encountered. Since
			she came to me a few hours ago,
			I have made two complete
			examinations of Counselor Troi.
			This is from the first
			examination. The fetus is about
			halfway through the first
			trimester -- about six weeks old.
			Understand, we...
			... believe conception occurred
			about eleven hours ago.
			What?
			It gets better.
			The second exam, an hour later
			was consistent, except for the
			fact that the fetus "appeared"
			to be several weeks older.
			At this growth rate, Counselor
			Troi will have her baby within
			the next thirty-six hours. The
			normal gestation for a Betazoid
			is ten months.
			I do not mean to be indelicate,
			but...
			... who's the father?
			Last night, while I slept...
			something... which I can only
			describe it as a presence, entered
			my body.
			A life-form of unknown origin
			and intent is breeding right now
			inside Counselor Troi. Our
			purpose here is to determine what
			is to be done about this very
			"unusual" situation. Discussion.
			Let me get this straight -- Deanna
			was impregnated by... by what?
			Doctor, what do your tests show?
			Is it a humanoid? An alien?
			It's a male human... or in this
			case half-human -- half-Betazoid.
			Exactly the same as Deanna!
			In every way. There is no
			indication from any of my tests
			of any other genetic patterns
			except hers.
			I don't think this is a random
			occurrence. There is a purpose
			here -- a reason. What, I don't
			know.
			Captain, obviously the pregnancy
			must be terminated.
			Why?
			For the safety of the ship and
			crew.
			Worf, you can't assume its intent
			is belligerent.
			That is my safest assumption.
			Captain, this is a life-form.
			Not to allow it to develop
			naturally would deny us the
			opportunity to study it.
			If the fetus is aborted,
			laboratory analysis is still
			possible.
			Is there any health risk to
			Counselor Troi if the fetus is
			aborted?
			Medically, no.
			Doctor, is that your
			recommendation?
			Captain, do whatever you feel is
			necessary to protect the ship and
			the crew... but know this. I am
			going to have this baby.
			I believe that ends the
			discussion.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			have finally arrived at 'aucdet
			Nine. We will pick up the
			specimens of Plasma Plague and
			transport them to Rachelis.
			It is only because so many lives
			are at stake that I am willing
			to put this ship and crew at such
			great risk.
			How are you feeling?
			I should be feeling uncomfortable
			with all the changes in my
			body... but, I'm not. I feel
			fine -- better than fine.
			Wonderful.
			Standard orbit.
			Standard orbit, aye.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			'Aucdet Nine, this is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
			Enterprise.
			Ah... yes... Enterprise you're
			here at last. Good.
			Excuse me, to whom am I speaking?
			Oh... I'm Lieutenant Commander
			Hester Dealt. The medical trustee
			of the Federation Medical
			Collection Station.
			Are the specimens ready for
			transfer?
			Yes, but with your permission I
			would like to inspect the
			containment area before we
			proceed. It is not that I doubt
			the ability of your crew; we just
			cannot afford a mistake.
			I appreciate your caution -- in
			the same vein, I need a complete,
			detailed manifest of everything
			which you intend to bring on board
			my ship.
			I will allow access to the
			computer banks.
			Download the inventory and go
			through it with Doctor Pulaski.
			Number One, arrange to have Hester
			Dealt transported up.
			Captain, I'm suddenly feeling a
			little tired. I'll be in my
			quarters if you need me.
			It won't be long now. Soon
			you'll arrive and so many
			questions will be answered.
			This is very good. Exactly what's
			needed.
			I just followed your instructions.
			Good. Exactly what I wanted.
			Five hundred and twelve
			compartments. Individually
			controlled. Very good.
			Independent of one another.
			Perfect. Ah, they can be
			monitored from here. And,
			isolation is assured. Very, very
			good.
			I wanted to be sure they wouldn't
			get out.
			Good, Lieutenant. Very good
			indeed.
			How's it coming, Mister La Forge?
			It will be just a little while
			longer. I want to go over it
			again in more detail.
			It will be another couple of
			hours, Commander.
			You do understand, it's critical
			that we have zero growth.
			Oh, yes. I understand. So, you
			go over it as many times as you
			want.
			It's been fourteen hours since
			we arrived at 'aucdet Nine.
			Hester Dealt is making final
			selections of the specimens we
			will carry. Meanwhile, we
			continue to receive desperate
			pleas from the Rachelis System.
			Captain, the final manifest has
			been received.
			At last. Review it with Doctor
			Pulaski. I want both of you to
			be completely familiar with it.
			Aye sir.
			Data -- help me get to Sickbay.
			It's time.
			Oh, you bet it is. Let's get you
			into Sickbay.
			Worf -- assemble your security team
			in Sickbay.
			Is that necessary?
			Yes -- captain's orders.
			Strange to need armed guards in
			the delivery room.
			Yes, and strange to think my child
			is the cause.
			Before you referred to it as "the
			child," now it's become your
			child.
			Yes, whatever his beginnings,
			that's what he's become.
			How frequent are your
			contractions?
			Very close together.
			In all my other deliveries -- with
			a couple of exceptions -- the
			father was present.
			Difficult under the circumstances.
			It's unfortunate you have to go
			through this alone. It helps to
			have someone with you.
			Perhaps I could serve in that
			capacity. I can quickly review
			the procedures I will be required
			to execute.
			Troi is going to need the comfort
			of a "human" touch... Not the cold
			hand of technology.
			Doctor. I think Commander Data
			will do nicely.
			Your choice.
			There is nothing specific you have
			to do, Data, you just have to be
			with me.
			There is nothing to be nervous
			about.
			This is very interesting to me.
			Although I understand in technical
			terms how life is formed, there
			is still a part of the process
			which eludes my understanding.
			I began my existence as an adult.
			I have no memory -- no cognizance
			of conception, birth, childhood,
			so to be allowed to witness this
			event is...
			It's happening.
			Doctor!
			This is an impatient baby. He's
			eager to make his appearance.
			I'll give you something for the
			pain. It won't in any way
			diminish the experience.
			I have felt no pain.
			None?
			No... none at all.
			Have your security team stand over
			there. I understand the need to
			have you here, but keep out from
			under foot.
			Are easy births the norm for
			Betazoids?
			Not according to my mother.
			It's a boy. A normal, healthy,
			six pound, three ounce baby boy.
			You can come the rest of the way
			in now.
			No threat here, Lieutenant, you
			and your men can relax... it's
			just a baby.
			It was remarkable. Thank you for
			allowing me to participate.
			Do you have a name?
			Ian Andrew, after my father.
			Captain.
			Picard here.
			Counselor Troi is the mother of
			a very healthy baby boy. Mother
			and child are both doing well.
			Counselor, my best wishes to you
			and your son.
			Thank you, sir.
			Have you been here all along?
			Yes.
			He's beautiful, Deanna... just
			like his mother.
			I don't think you are going to
			be needed here, Lieutenant.
			How do you feel?
			Fine. Absolutely wonderful and
			thank you, Doctor... for
			everything.
			Amazing.
			Welcome to the bridge, Doctor.
			How's Counselor Troi? Did she
			have a good night?
			I have delivered dozens of babies.
			But none like this. There was
			no pain, no trauma. It was
			effortless for both of them.
			I'm not sure of your point.
			She had the baby yesterday. If
			I were to examine her now, I would
			not be able to tell that she just
			had a baby, or ever had a baby.
			It's as though the incident never
			happened.
			How long before we are ready to
			begin the transfer?
			Two hours, nineteen minutes.
			You have the Conn, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			Doctor, you would accompany me,
			please. I think it's time I paid
			my respects.
			Come in.
			I wanted to come by and see how
			you were and have a look at
			your...
			... baby! My goodness.
			How old is he?
			In actuality a day.
			Yes, but...
			... In appearance, almost four
			earth years old.
			Ian, say hello to Captain Picard.
			You mean he can talk?
			Hello.
			Hello, Ian.
			Don't worry. Everything is fine.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are faced with two major problems:
			Troi's child and the deadly cargo
			we are about to load, which is
			so desperately needed in the
			Rachelis system. In the hours
			since his birth, Troi's baby has
			continued to age and now appears,
			physically and mentally, to be
			a child of eight. And still there
			is no indication as to who he is,
			or why he is here.
			Sickbay, this is the bridge. We
			are ready to begin loading.
			We need a little more time. It's
			taking longer than we anticipated.
			Data,
			look at this.
			Data.
			What?
			My name. It is pronounced Data.
			Oh?
			You called me Data.
			What's the difference?
			One is my name and the other is
			not.
			Is this possible?
			In all of your neural nets,
			algorithms, and heuristics, is
			there some combination which makes
			up a circuit for bruised feelings?
			Apparently so, because I think
			I just offended your tender
			sensibilities.
			Possible?
			I am unfamiliar with these
			symbols.
			It indicates a genetically
			engineered biological life-form.
			About twenty percent of the
			specimens fall into that category.
			Some eager beaver at play.
			Query... "eager beaver?"
			In this case, 'eager beaver'
			refers to some overachieving
			genetic engineer, who probably
			for lack of something better to
			do forced this strain of virus
			to mutate, just to see how bad,
			bad can get.
			Captain Picard.
			Picard here.
			Just so you fully appreciate the
			risks we are about to take...
			Enlighten me.
			If the most innocuous specimen
			on the manifest list gets loose,
			it will destroy all life on the
			Enterprise in a matter of hours.
			I understand, Doctor. Do you have
			a recommendation?
			Considering how desperately this
			is needed, no I don't. Just want
			you to know what we're carrying.
			Thank you, Doctor. Commander
			Data, if you have completed your
			review, you are needed in
			Transporter Room Three.
			Yes, sir.
			Excuse me, Doctor.
			That's okay...
			Data, Data... whatever.
			Ian!
			He's a very tactile child. He
			wants to touch and feel
			everything.
			Come on, sweetheart, time to go.
			Unbelievable -- I think he's
			actually grown since you dropped
			him off.
			I like it here, Mommy.
			I thought you would. Thank Miss
			Gladstone for having you, and
			let's go get you something to eat.
			Thank you.
			Bye...
			Thank you.
			The transporter is not making a
			positive lock.
			The built-in inhibitor is
			restricting onloading of
			life-forms known to be hazardous
			to the occupants of this ship.
			Have you attempted override?
			I don't have the authority.
			Computer, recognize -- Lieutenant
			Commander N-F-N, N-M-I, Data.
			Authorization accepted.
			Initiate override protocol.
			Override protocol is not
			recommended in this situation.
			Acknowledged. On my authority
			-- begin override.
			Sequence complete.
			Cargo Deck Five. We will commence
			transport on your command.
			Transporter Three -- we are ready
			to receive.
			Data, the first batch is in place.
			Ready for the next.
			Inform me when loading is complete
			and the cargo secure.
			Aye, sir.
			I wanted to stop by and see how
			Ian was doing.
			We're doing fine. I was just
			going to give Ian his supper.
			Do you want your supper now, too?
			No, Ian, but thank you for the
			invitation.
			You're welcome.
			Have you ever played with puppies?
			They had a litter today in the
			nursery.
			No, I have never played with
			puppies.
			You'd like it. You should go
			to the nursery while the puppies
			are still there.
			Perhaps later.
			Ouch...
			Ow... Mommy... ow...
			Let me look at that.
			It's not serious.
			My face is wet.
			Is it better now, sweetheart?
			He allowed himself to be burned.
			Yes, for the experience.
			Who is he? Why is he here? What
			does he want?
			Ian, could you tell us why you
			are here?
			Because Mommy said it was time
			to eat.
			No, I mean... why you are here
			on this ship?
			I live here.
			Ian, the captain wants to know
			if you are ready to tell us why
			you came here.
			No. Not yet.
			The answer is within him. When
			his cognitive powers develop
			sufficiently, he will be able to
			articulate it.
			I hope he will tell us soon.
			Captain to the bridge.
			I'm on my way, Number One.
			Keep me apprised of his progress,
			Counselor.
			Bye...
			The cargo has been loaded and is
			secure.
			Take us out of orbit, Number One
			-- then set a course for Rachelis
			-- warp nine.
			Can I get you something?
			No. I just wanted to stand here.
			I don't blame you -- it's
			beautiful.
			Yes.
			How about some nice Mareuvian Tea?
			No. Nothing thank you.
			You're going to be leaving soon.
			Yes.
			What do you see when you look out
			there?
			Over there is the Lorenze cluster,
			and there Arneb and there Epsilon
			Indi.
			No, I don't mean that. I mean
			when you look there don't you see
			your future?
			It will still be there.
			How about a cup of nectar direct
			from Prometheus?
			No -- nothing. That's the third
			time you've asked me.
			It's what I'm expected to do.
			Don't you always do what's
			expected?
			I try to.
			Even if it's not what you really
			want?
			Sometimes. Sometimes you have
			to consider others more than
			yourself.
			That's true. But sometimes the
			game is to know when to consider
			yourself more than others and to
			give yourself permission to be...
			selfish.
			Something's wrong.
			What is it?
			Growth.
			Where?
			L-seven-three.
			Bridge, this is Cargo Deck Five.
			Yes, Lieutenant La Forge.
			There is a malfunction in the
			containment area.
			How serious?
			Very.
			Captain's log, supplemental. For
			reasons as yet unknown, one of
			the specimens of Plasma Plague
			is growing.
			Captain, the power to the
			containment grid must have somehow
			been affected when we increased
			to warp velocity.
			I don't see how that would be
			possible.
			I don't either, but if we could
			return to impulse, we would know
			for sure.
			Impulse velocity.
			Report, Mister La Forge.
			There's no change. It wasn't the
			warp drive.
			Permission to leave the bridge.
			Granted.
			Commander Data, you're with me.
			Doctor Pulaski.
			Yes, Captain.
			We are having some difficulties
			on Cargo Deck Five -- your presence
			is requested.
			I'm on my way.
			You never talk about yourself.
			Sure I do... all the time.
			People say you are very old...
			Oh?
			... and that you knew Captain
			Picard when he was on the
			Stargazer.
			No. I never met the captain until
			I came onboard.
			Everyone is very curious about
			you.
			I'll bet they are.
			About where you come from.
			Where do they say?
			I heard that you're from Nova Kron
			and that...
			Mister Crusher, report to the
			bridge.
			I've got to go.
			Thank you.
			There's nothing like a dish of
			Delovian souffle.
			I didn't mean the souffle, I meant
			for... well... the rest. Thanks.
			That's why I'm here.
			Take the Conn, Mister Crusher.
			On this course -- increase velocity
			to warp nine.
			Aye, sir. Warp nine.
			Why that module and not the
			others?
			Computer, run diagnostic on module
			L-seven-three.
			All circuits functional.
			Temperature -- as set -- minus
			ninety-seven degrees. Humidity
			-- twelve percent. Lumins -- zero.
			Electromagnetic containment
			integrity... Everything right down
			the line... exactly as it should
			be.
			Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction.
			Computer -- query. Is growth
			actually occurring?
			Confirmed.
			One of the specimens is growing.
			Destroy it, now.
			I can't.
			Data, prepare to jettison that
			module.
			We can't do that either. It will
			go into a spore and remain until
			it comes in contact with a planet
			or another ship. The results
			would be disastrous.
			Commander, your attitude tells
			me that however bad I think this
			is... it's worse.
			This is not going to hold it.
			Go on.
			The rate of growth is increasing.
			Within thirty minutes it will push
			out of the module. Within two
			hours, it will breach the
			containment area.
			It can't break through this.
			Yes it can.
			Captain. We may not be able to
			get control of this situation.
			I recommend making arrangements
			to transfer all non-essential
			personnel to the saucer section.
			If we lose containment we should
			be prepared to separate.
			Make it so.
			Why this one specimen and none
			of the others? Something is
			stimulating it. Do you have its
			etiology? How it was developed?
			It's a mutated strain developed
			by Doctor Susan Nuress during an
			outbreak of Plasma Plague seventy
			years ago in the Oby System.
			It was number nine in a series
			of tests. This particular one
			bombarded by low levels of Eichner
			radiation.
			Could exposure to Eichner
			radiation stimulate growth?
			Yes, it could, but...
			Uh, oh...
			Don't tell me.
			I'm detecting low levels of
			Eichner radiation.
			Why didn't you catch it before?
			Because it wasn't here before..
			Well, it is now. What emits that
			type radiation?
			A subspace phase inverter.
			We don't have one.
			Certain cyanoacrylates.
			Also, not on this ship... What
			else? Because it's here and we
			better find it.
			I can feel that some of the people
			are very... worried.
			Yes. I feel it as well, but don't
			you worry.
			It's me Mommy -- I'm the reason.
			What?
			It's me.
			You?
			Yes. I have to leave you now,
			or it will be very bad for
			everyone.
			What are you saying?
			I have to leave now.
			Leave?
			You are going to die. No. No,
			you can't.
			Sickbay, this is Counselor Troi,
			I need the doctor in my
			quarters... right now.
			No... Ian... No.
			It's Ian. Please... please hurry.
			Save him, you must save him.
			What happened? Did he eat
			anything? Did he fall?
			No.
			The child is the source of the
			unusual radiation.
			He said he's the reason the ship
			is in danger.
			That analysis is correct.
			I'm losing life signs.
			Oh, please. Please save him.
			I'm sorry.
			Captain. The containment field
			has stabilized.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Then Ian was right. He was the
			cause.
			Apparently so.
			He is a life-force entity... as
			we passed each other in space he
			was curious and wanted to know
			about us, and he thought the best
			way to learn was to go through
			the process. To be born, to live
			as one of us and in that way to
			understand us.
			Captain, he never meant any harm.
			There was a moment when you
			smiled.
			He said thank you.
			I told him we will miss him -- and
			I will.
			Standard station approach, Mister
			Crusher.
			Standard approach, aye.
			Transporter Room Three, this is
			the captain. We have arrived.
			Let's make this transfer with all
			deliberate speed, and get on about
			our business.
			Yes, sir.
			I will be glad to be relieved of
			this cargo.
			You have the bridge, Number One.
			Yes sir.
			Captain.
			Yes Ensign?
			Could I see you when you have a
			moment?
			In my Ready Room when your duties
			permit.
			Thank you, sir.
			Good luck.
			Data, you can lock on to the first
			group and begin transporting on
			my mark.
			Come.
			Yes, Ensign.
			Captain... I have thought about
			this a lot. I want to remain on
			the Enterprise.
			Oh. Have you discussed this with
			your mother?
			No, before I do that, I wanted
			your permission to stay.
			Wes, it's a little more
			complicated than that.
			Captain, for right now... this
			is where I want to be. This is
			where I feel I belong.
			Captain -- transfer complete. We
			are ready to leave orbit.
			Make it so, Number One.
			Return to your position.
			All stations secure.
			Take us out of orbit, Mister
			Crusher and lay in a course for
			the Morgana Quadrant.
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Crusher has requested to
			remain on the Enterprise.
			I'm not surprised. How did you
			respond?
			I haven't as yet, Number One.
			I don't think it's my decision
			alone. His remaining will cause
			difficulties for us all.
			Yes, indeed. With his mother not
			around, who will see to his
			studies?
			Exactly. That duty would fall
			to Commander Data.
			And, who'll tuck him in at night?
			Come on, Commander.
			I will accept that responsibility.
			Well, we know he'll get his sleep.
			Then, Number One, that leaves you
			the task of guiding young Mister
			Crusher through his most hazardous
