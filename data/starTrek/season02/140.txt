			Captain's log, Stardate 42686.4.
			We are en route to Starbase
			Montgomery for engineering
			consultations prompted by minor
			readout anomalies...
			I would consider them
			insignificant.
			What if you're wrong?
			Sorry.
			But what if it's more than a mere
			discrepancy?
			Then I'd say we have a problem.
			Agreed. We'll have Starbase
			Montgomery give us an independent
			reading.
			Even if the molecular level
			controls failed, we could
			recrystallize the dilithium
			without outside help.
			Data, don't worry. My ego isn't
			at stake here.
			Perhaps we could reprogram the
			system to correct the readout
			variables --
			That's certainly an option, but
			since we're stopping at Starbase
			Montgomery anyway, we'll let them
			do the analysis.
			Sir? I don't recall Starbase
			Montgomery on our mission
			itinerary --
			I think we could all use a
			twelve-hour layover. Besides,
			I've just received some personnel
			transfer directives. Priority
			matters --
			Boarding or disembarking?
			Captain Picard, we're within
			hailing range of Starbase
			Montgomery --
			Reduce to impulse power --
			Meet me in the Observation Lounge
			when you're done here.
			Captain...
			Number One, I find myself
			recollecting the arrival of a new
			first officer to the Enterprise
			and a manual docking very
			confidently achieved. I suspect
			that I was somewhat miserly in
			offering congratulations then,
			so let me make up for it now.
			Congratulations. The captain of
			the Starship Ares is retiring.
			You've been selected as his
			replacement.
			The Ares... she is in Vega-Omicron
			sector.
			And she's picked up indications
			of an intelligent life-form...
			but nothing conclusive.
			Starfleet will want to know
			more.
			That's why they're asking you,
			Number One. Not for your military
			proficiency, but for your skill
			as an explorer and diplomat.
			Vega-Omicron. It'll take months
			at high warp just to get there.
			With no guarantee of finding
			anything once you arrive. Well,
			you have twelve hours to think
			it over. And maybe it's premature,
			but congratulations, "Captain."
			Establish synchronous orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			Starbase Montgomery is sending
			a civilian advisor aboard to brief
			you on the Ares's mission.
			A personal briefing?
			Yes. Strategic attache with
			specialized knowledge of the
			frontier regions. I think you'll
			find the briefing... very
			interesting.
			I hope it's complete. Much of
			my decision will be based on it.
			Commander Riker to the Transporter
			Room.
			Enjoy...
			Ensign --
			Ah, you're right on time,
			Commander. He's on his way now...
			Dad... ?
			You're the civilian advisor? The
			strategic attache?
			I asked Captain Picard to keep
			it quiet. I didn't want you to
			get nervous... excited.
			It's been fifteen years.
			Excitement is hardly the
			appropriate emotion.
			You've done well. First officer
			on the Enterprise is quite a
			feather in your cap.
			I've worked hard.
			Of course. I'm proud of you,
			Will --
			If you'll excuse me, I've got my
			duties to attend to. After you've
			settled in, we'll complete the
			briefing.
			Have security send an escort for
			this gentleman.
			Did you hear about Commander
			Riker's promotion?
			Yes.
			He didn't even know his father
			was coming. It was a complete
			surprise --
			So?
			Well, can you imagine if it was
			your father?
			I never knew my father.
			And I didn't have one long
			enough --
			It is a waste of time to think
			about such things.
			I'm not thinking about it, really,
			but everybody needs somebody,
			don't you think -- ?
			Enough!
			Starbase Montgomery really didn't
			have to send me all this help,
			because we've already checked the
			entire dilithium spectrum for
			anomalous frequencies, so don't
			waste your time on that --
			Wes... you okay?
			I was just talking to Worf.
			He's somewhat eccentric at times.
			That's one word for it.
			But he was so upset -- I must've
			said something wrong.
			Maybe Worf's not too thrilled
			with the idea of losing Commander
			Riker to a new assignment. I'm
			sure not --
			Neither am I... But I think
			it's something else with Worf...
			something's really bothering
			him.
			Female?
			Career?
			Family.
			That is trouble. You choose your
			friends... you choose your
			enemies... But family... that's
			in the stars.
			So I've heard.
			Boliska! What in the name of
			the Federation are you doing
			here -- ?
			Excuse me...
			This is more than a surprise...
			it's total shock.
			You mean you didn't bake me a
			cake?
			You're actually here.
			That makes two of us.
			How about a drink?
			How about a kiss?
			They know each other...
			I know her too, but we don't do
			that.
			And it has nothing to do with
			Commander Riker's new assignment?
			No. His reaction to that was just
			the opposite of mine: Completely
			unaffected.
			You see? With all that's going
			on, you might be overreacting.
			Really? You try talking to Worf.
			I'm telling you, he's not...
			normal... for Worf.
			There is, of course, a genetic
			predisposition toward hostility
			among all Klingons, although Worf
			does seem unusually out of sorts.
			He's never been much on charm --
			Well, whatever troubles him, we
			should try to help. He is our
			friend.
			And I'd like to keep him
			friendly.
			Any suggestions?
			Empirical study. Monitor the
			subject.
			Right. We'll watch for any
			signs of unusual behavior --
			That shouldn't be difficult --
			Within the norms of Klingon
			patterns, of course.
			Discretion will be required.
			Fine. Where do we start?
			We... will assist you as needed.
			You found the problem...
			And you must solve it.
			... and after working out the
			Fuurinkazan battle strategies
			at the Tokyo Base, I was asked
			to go to work for Starfleet as
			a tactical advisor.
			I'm surprised you stayed away from
			the action as long as you did --
			Hi, Will -- join us? Your father
			and I were just catching up --
			You never told me you knew him.
			Well... it wasn't exactly a
			secret... but it never really came
			up --
			Pull up a stool, son --
			I'm ready for your briefing
			whenever you are, sir.
			You think Worf is going to
			appreciate being observed like
			some laboratory specimen?
			You are correct. He is not
			insensitive... particularly at
			this stage of his development.
			Just remember, this is Wesley's
			operation, okay?
			Wesley is quite competent.
			You guys aren't going to believe
			this...
			Believe what?
			Commander Riker just caught me
			coming out of the turbolift.
			So? This area isn't off limits
			to you.
			I know, but I've been working on
			Paracelsian computations as part
			of my studies and he wants them
			right away.
			What about Worf?
			When Commander Riker says right
			away he means right away.
			Indeed.
			You guys can cover for me, can't
			you?
			Wait a minute. This whole
			thing --
			I've got to get my computations
			done.
			You don't expect us to --
			Oh, come on. What are friends
			for?
			Right?
			Go ahead. Finish your work and
			We shall study Worf.
			I knew I could count on you guys!
			... good seeing you too, Graham --
			You wouldn't be running for mayor,
			would you?
			Do pick-up work for the Federation
			long enough and it'll happen to
			you, too.
			I thought about you a lot.
			Kyle... I don't need to hear what
			you don't need to say.
			We could've been great together.
			Possibly.
			Is it true you got married?
			Again... and again.
			Doesn't that make you three for
			three?
			I'm not complaining. They were
			each good men... and we're all
			still good friends.
			Like us?
			Close... but different.
			They were all a little more...
			in touch with themselves.
			Ouch.
			Kyle, face facts. You're
			crusty. A reputation for being
			hard as nails and getting the
			job done. But underneath all
			that, you're not so bad. Some
			of us even love you.
			And then there's Will.
			And then there's Will.
			Wesley really should be doing this
			on his own --
			But he needs his study time --
			I can't believe you fell for that.
			I don't know... he looks pretty
			normal to me.
			In solitude there is nothing to
			trigger unusual behavior.
			Good point. Let's not tamper with
			the status quo...
			That would defeat the opportunity
			for our behavioral research.
			The probabilities are that he's
			simply lonely. We can relieve
			his anxieties through
			socialization --
			Be my guest.
			Excuse me, Lieutenant --
			You seem to have lost the will
			to communicate with others.
			You have friends here. We care
			about you. Why, just awhile ago,
			Wesley, Geordi and I were saying
			how --
			Sir... with all due respect...
			BE GONE!
			He seems quite sincere in his
			desire for solitude.
			Seeing is believing, huh?
			Come in.
			Yes, Worf?
			May I have a moment, sir?
			What is it?
			It is difficult to say... words
			are not always easy for me...
			Is that Earth?
			Yes. Alaska... I was nine
			there...
			That is a big fish you are
			holding.
			I didn't even catch that fish.
			You were holding it like --
			I hooked it... but my father took
			the pole... wouldn't even let me
			reel it in... he said I might lose
			it.
			You do not have good feelings
			for your father?
			I'm... not sure how I feel right
			now...
			You have much on your mind.
			Yes.
			What is on yours?
			The Enterprise has been good to
			me...
			To all of us.
			It has been my home... but still,
			I am alone here.
			Not true. You have many friends
			here, just as I have --
			Then why do you make ready to
			leave the Enterprise?
			I've been offered my own command,
			something I've trained for...
			And what of your friends?
			Friendship is something we carry
			in our hearts... We can feel it
			wherever we are.
			Yes. On Kling we say, "Tez mrot
			weilz konpadam": One is always
			of his tribe.
			I would like to join you on the
			Ares.
			Thank you, Worf. But I haven't
			accepted the assignment yet --
			But sir... it could be a
			dangerous mission. There may
			be the potential for combat.
			That's not the purpose of the
			mission.
			Still -- to die a true hero --
			Worf. Your point is made.
			Then I know you will do the right
			thing, sir.
			Finally. We're alone. Maybe --
			I'm here for the briefing, sir.
			All you need to know is here.
			The mission details could've been
			transmitted --
			I've been hearing good things
			about you.
			Why didn't I ever hear from you?
			I know. Keeping in touch isn't
			my strong suit.
			Funny thing about being a parent.
			There aren't any tech manuals,
			no quick readouts to get you to
			the next set of variables. You
			just kind of wing it from day to
			day... Will, when your mother
			died --
			Excuse me, sir, but I need to
			study this briefing material...
			Will. I came to the Enterprise
			because... look, considering
			where you might be going, I wanted
			to...
			I'm here with my hand out,
			son --
			Poor guy. Picked up a flu virus
			on our last stop at Nasreldine.
			Sounds nasty. What's the
			therapy?
			Tryptophan-lysine distillates
			with generous doses of PCS.
			PCS?
			"Pulaski's Chicken Soup."
			You've still got the touch,
			haven't you?
			I like to help. When they hurt,
			I hurt.
			Commander Pulaski's greatest
			medical skill is her empathy.
			You must be Commander Riker's
			father.
			Yes, but how --
			We've all heard about you.
			And I've felt certain things.
			This is Deanna Troi, ship's
			counselor.
			Kyle Riker.
			I thought you two should meet.
			Troi's job is to keep us from
			deluding ourselves.
			Let me guess: Betazoid?
			At your service.
			I've got some lab work to do, so
			if you'll excuse me...
			Why do I get the feeling this is
			a set-up?
			Because you are intelligent,
			wise... and quite correct.
			I've been set up with worse,
			that's for sure --
			You're also anxious about
			something. It's your son, isn't
			it? You're not as close to him
			as you'd like to be...
			Oh, I don't know. Wouldn't you
			say we both have pretty good taste
			in women?
			I'd like to help if I can. If
			you allow me.
			Fine. What do you want from me?
			I came here to bury the hatchet
			with Will and I find out the
			ground is frozen solid.
			You're not the kind of man who
			gives up so easily.
			I didn't say I was giving up.
			It would just be nice to get a
			little something from him.
			What is it you want from him?
			I don't know. Acknowledgement,
			maybe... or --
			Respect is earned, not bestowed.
			Respect? I don't need that from
			him.
			Perhaps you want him to be proud
			of you, for you carry great pride
			in his accomplishments --
			Absolutely! Look at him! First
			officer on the Enterprise, just
			offered his first command --
			Yet... You covet his success --
			Please. He'd be lucky to have
			the career I've had!
			True. You are well respected in
			your field.
			I may have something of a
			reputation for excellence --
			And false humility.
			My guess is that Will finds you
			pretty fascinating. Candor seems
			to be a trait he admires.
			Honesty is the trait he admires.
			You're very competitive with him,
			aren't you?
			Maybe... in the past. But I'm
			here to help Will prepare for his
			first mission as captain.
			Are you sure he'll accept such
			a dangerous assignment?
			He'll take it just because it is
			so dangerous.
			How can you be so sure?
			Because I would. And we aren't
			so different, Will and I...
			I've seen your mission briefing.
			Yes, sir.
			Any questions?
			No sir.
			Other than a mention of the Ares's
			first officer.
			His name is Flaherty, as I recall.
			That's right. The briefing said
			something about uncanny linguistic
			skills.
			Correct. The last time I saw him,
			Commander Flaherty spoke over
			forty languages. Klingon,
			Romulan, Giamon, and Stroyerian
			were among the more colorful, as
			I recall...
			He speaks alien dialects?
			He has the unique ability of
			instantaneously interpreting,
			collating, and extrapolating any
			verbal communication he hears.
			You should find him helpful in
			Sector Vega-Omicron.
			I'm sure I will.
			Enter.
			Captain Picard. At last.
			I'd like to thank you for all the
			help you've been to my son --
			My only regret is that your
			reunion will mark Will's farewell.
			He's ready for this command.
			I have no doubt --
			Captain? May I have a word with
			my son?
			Of course... excuse me,
			gentlemen...
			I won't be pushed into this.
			Oh, come on, Willy. Don't you
			think you're ready for the
			Ares -- ?
			Starfleet does.
			Of course. You're the best
			candidate for this job. But I
			want you to know I'm here if you
			need me...
			I've been on my own since I was
			fifteen. I can take care of
			myself.
			Please! Spare me the "pain" of
			your childhood. I hung in there
			for thirteen years. If that
			wasn't enough, then that's just
			too bad.
			Maybe I missed something --
			The ship's computer would have
			corrected immediately --
			My inputs could have been in
			error --
			Geordi! Data! I figured out
			Worf's problem --
			You spoke to him?
			No, no. I accessed the complete
			Klingon cultural database. It
			took some time, but --
			Okay, Wesley. What is the
			problem?
			It's the tenth anniversary of
			Worf's Age of Ascension.
			His what?
			The Age of Ascension is a
			Klingon ritual of great
			significance. A rite of
			initiation, marking a new level
			of Klingon spiritual attainment.
			Of what significance is the
			anniversary of this event?
			It's a day of ritual and
			celebration with one's fellow
			Klingons... and he doesn't have
			any Klingon friends.
			But we're his friends --
			But we don't practice Klingon
			tradition. And we're not
			Klingons.
			Worf's feeling socially...
			culturally isolated.
			Well, what do you suggest? I'm
			not sure I'd like to invite a
			bunch of Klingons on board --
			We can program the ship's computer
			to provide us with simulations
			on the Holodeck --
			Holographic Klingons? Sure. Why
			not?
			We need only to program the
			computer with details of the
			specific ceremony...
			The cultural database said the
			initiate's family must be
			present --
			So? We're his family. We'll go.
			I just wonder what kind of party
			the Klingons had in mind...
			Do you have a minute?
			Sure...
			I wanted to apologize for my
			remarks in Ten-Forward. Your past
			is none of my business.
			Even if it involves your father?
			Yes. Even if it involves my
			father.
			Did he ever tell you why he never
			remarried?
			What woman would have him? With
			an ego like his --
			I would have. In a cold minute.
			Twelve years ago, Kyle Riker was
			a civilian strategist advising
			Starfleet in its conflict with
			the Tholians. The starbase he
			was working from was attacked.
			None of the base crew was expected
			to live. And they all died...
			All except your father.
			Your father alone had the will
			to endure, to face the pain, to
			live.
			I never knew that about him.
			I never saw a man fight so hard
			in my life.
			And you fell in love?
			Yes. And so did he.
			But marriage was out of the
			question. He had other
			priorities...
			His career.
			You know, if I were you... going
			out on the Ares, I'd jettison
			the emotional baggage you're
			still carrying around.
			Now the Klingon cultural database
			was very specific on the setting.
			Let me guess: A twenty-piece
			orchestra in a magnificent
			ballroom. Everybody in formal
			wear --
			There's an unusual test of
			inner strength involved --
			I believe that will entail the
			use of Klingon "painstiks."
			"Painstiks"? Sounds lovely --
			Enduring physical suffering is
			considered a Klingon spiritual
			test.
			You mean... for Worf to celebrate
			the anniversary of his
			Ascension... he has to be hurt?
			And we have to witness this?
			We are his family.
			Come.
			Everything in order, Number One?
			I'd be a fool to turn this
			promotion down, wouldn't I?
			I don't know, and if you're
			asking me what I think you should
			do, I don't know that either.
			But I can spell out, albeit
			crudely, what you are choosing
			between.
			Your present position as first
			officer of the Enterprise brings
			you prestige, distinction, even
			glamour of a kind. You are the
			second in command of Starfleet's
			flagship -- but still, second in
			command. Your promotion will
			transfer you to a relatively
			insignificant ship in an obscure
			corner of the galaxy, but it will
			be your ship. Being who you are,
			that ship will vibrate with your
			authority, your style, your
			vision. There is no substitute
			for being in the center of the
			stage -- any stage.
			I'll need a little more time
			before I'll have a decision.
			Granted.
			They find anything yet?
			Not yet...
			There is nothing to find.
			No harm in checking, I guess.
			Really? How would you like
			them giving your transporter
			operation a little once-over?
			No problem. We're totally
			ship-shape.
			You miss the point. It's just
			the idea that they even suspect
			a malfunction.
			Geordi, let them look.
			Chief, will you be able to attend
			a little party for Worf at
			seventeen hundred hours?
			A party for Worf? That sounds
			intriguing. I'd be delighted --
			It's a surprise, okay?
			My lips are sealed.
			I didn't want to leave without
			saying good-bye.
			I don't like good-byes. How about
			"until next time"?
			Until next time.
			It's been a pleasure serving with
			you, Commander.
			That's mutual, Counselor.
			I'm supposed to know how everyone
			feels... but I... I can't read
			you right now.
			Maybe your own feelings are
			getting in the way --
			My job is to help others sort
			out their emotions. My own
			feelings are beside the point --
			Not to me. Feelings are what
			make us human --
			Are you feeling sadness?
			Yes.
			So am I.
			I'll be leaving at twenty-one
			hundred hours. May I have a
			minute?
			Look, I've been giving you my best
			Academy courtesy -- but it's
			really time for you to go.
			It's time for us to talk, so lower
			your shields and --
			I'm asking you to leave, or I'll --
			You'll what?
			Y'know, it's really a shame
			there's no anbo-jyutsu ring nearby,
			because you need to be put in your
			place.
			Really? There is. Deck Twelve.
			The gymnasium.
			Why don't we clear the air once
			and for all -- ?
			You're on.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42686.9.
			(TO BE DETERMINED)
			Ship's scuttlebutt has it that
			you wanted to see me.
			That's right...
			I thought I knew you, Kyle.
			You do. About as well as
			anyone --
			Then what's this about an
			anbo-jyutsu match with Will?
			You heard.
			Haven't we grown beyond the point
			where we resolve our problems
			through physical conflict?
			I think you're overreacting --
			I'm overreacting. You're the one
			who's going to fight his own son!
			It's not a fight, Kate. Think
			of it as more of a... "contest."
			And suppose one of you is injured?
			I know where to find a good
			doctor.
			Don't patronize me, Kyle.
			Look. Will and I started playing
			anbo-jyutsu when he was eight.
			He knows how to handle himself...
			and so do I.
			Well, don't take this the wrong
			way, but Will's in his prime,
			and --
			-- And I'm no spring chicken, I
			know.
			Don't worry. He's never been able
			to beat me.
			Computer... Is this it?
			Correct. Klingon Rite of
			Ascension Chamber.
			Is this really necessary?
			If we're going to get Worf through
			his problem, it is.
			Computer... may we please have
			Klingon personnel appropriate for
			this event?
			These images are specifically
			programmed for Ascension rites.
			Cute bunch.
			And they use those?
			Those are Klingon painstiks. I
			once saw one of them used against
			a two-ton Rectyne Monopod. Poor
			creature jumped five meters at
			the slightest touch. Finally died
			from excessive cephalic pressures --
			You don't mean... ?
			That's right. The animal's head
			exploded just like --
			I think that's enough, Chief
			O'Brien.
			Are we ready?
			I do not enjoy riddles,
			Counselor.
			You will enjoy this one.
			I am in no mood for trifling or
			games! Not today!
			I know what an important day this
			is for you: The anniversary of
			your Rite of Ascension.
			You know about that?
			Yes. All your friends on board
			do.
			That is impossible. The Rite of
			Ascension is a secret known only
			to Klingons --
			-- And certain resourceful young
			Ensigns...
			Wesley? What does he know about
			it -- ?
			Enough. Now just bear with me.
			Where are we going?
			The Holodeck.
			This truly tries my patience,
			Counselor.
			I think you will approve.
			You are not going in?
			No.
			Open.
			An Ascension ceremony? For me?
			Happy anniversary, Worf.
			Thank you... oh, thank you!
			Shall we begin?
			Oh, yes. Please!
			DaHjaj SuvwI''e' jIH. tIgwIj
			Sa'angNIS. 'Iw bIQtIqDaq jIjaH.
			Today I am a Warrior. I must
			show you my heart. I travel the
			river of blood.
			The true test of Klingon strength
			is to admit one's most profound
			feelings... while under extreme
			duress.
			jIbechrup may' vIlos.
			The battle is mine. I crave only
			the blood of the enemy.
			HIHIvqa'.
			The bile of the vanquished flows
			over my hands.
			may'pequ' moH.
			Thank you, my friends. Thank
			you... You have my respect. My
			admiration. My eternal gratitude --
			Is Worf all right?
			He's never been happier.
			Then it was a good ceremony?
			Let's just say I wasn't about to
			stay for the refreshments.
			Klingon culture is not to your
			taste?
			I'm just glad humans have
			progressed beyond the need for
			such barbaric displays.
			Have they? Commander Riker and
			his father are up on the Holodeck
			about to engage in barbarism of
			their own.
			Don't remind me. It's not
			something of which I approve --
			In spite of human evolution, there
			seem to be certain traits endemic
			to gender.
			You think they're going to knock
			each other's brains out just
			because... they're men?
			Males are certainly unique. In
			adulthood, fathers continue to
			regard their sons as children...
			and sons continue to chafe against
			what they perceive as their
			fathers' expectations of them.
			It's almost as if they never
			really grow up at all, isn't it?
			Perhaps that's why men remain so
			attractive.
			Particularly men like Commander
			Riker?
			As well as his father, I'm sure...
			I just hope they don't hurt each
			other up there...
			Anbo-jyutsu. The ultimate
			evolution of the martial arts.
			I remember my early lessons.
			You could never get used to the
			sightless factor... or to losing.
			True. But I've had fifteen years
			of practice.
			Then let's see if you've learned
			anything...
			RIKER					KYLE
			You have been practicing.
			And remembering.
			You never should've let her die.
			Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.
			Good. Get it all out!
			Yoroshiku-onegaishimasu.
			Matta!
			I had you.
			Will, listen. You were too young
			to understand -- and I was too hurt
			to explain.
			You've never been hurt by
			anything.
			She was your mother, but she was
			my wife -- and when she died...
			all that kept me going was you.
			You had a strange way of showing
			it.
			Damnit, Will -- you were barely
			out of diapers. You hardly knew
			her. I loved her. Of course
			you've had the pain... and so have
			I. I should have tried to
			explain all of this long ago,
			but it hurt too much. Then a
			wall went up between us... and
			living there, just you and me...
			the wall got bigger.
			Why didn't we move away? Start
			over?
			I promised her. It was the life
			she wanted for you... so...
			I came here thinking we could
			talk this out. But maybe you're
			right. Maybe I'm no father at
			all... and you're no son. Maybe
			this... this fight is all we have
			left.
			Matta!
			What is it now?
			You can't do that!
			What?
			Hachidan kiritsu! That's
			illegal --
			You're kidding.
			All those years... That's why I
			could never win... you were
			cheating!
			Hey, it worked. Kept you coming
			back for more.
			I always hated that... and you
			were just cheating! Incredible!
			How'd you get away with it?
			You were just a kid.
			Once you were twelve, I knew I
			couldn't take you... but I had
			to keep you interested...
			challenged... didn't I?
			Y'know, I can talk to a roomful
			of admirals about anything in
			the galaxy... but why can't I talk
			to you about how I feel?
			How do you feel?
			How do you think, Will?
			I love you, son.
			Really?
			Really.
			I've got to get back to Starbase
			Montgomery...
			I know.
			I'm glad you came.
			You be careful, okay?
			Starbase Montgomery briefing
			specialist and analytical team
			have beamed down, sir.
			What were the analytical team's
			findings?
			They suggested we reprogram the
			system to correct the readout
			variables.
			Precisely what Data recommended,
			as I recall. But it did give
			Commander Riker the time he
			needed to consider his promotion.
			Now that he's accepted it, we can
			leave him at Starbase Montgomery.
			Number One?
			Captain... with your permission,
			I've decided to remain on the
			Enterprise.
			... granted.
			Thank you, sir.
			Take us out of orbit,
			Mister Crusher.
			Terminating synchronous orbit.
			Set course for Beta Kupsic...
			That is still our next
			destination?
			... Velocity - warp factor five.
			Course and speed set.
			Any particular reason for this
			change of heart?
			Motivated self-interest. Right
			now the best place for me to be
			is right here.
			Engage.
