			Captain's log, Stardate 42303.7.
			The Enterprise is bound for Star
			Station India to rendezvous with
			a Starfleet courier.
			Hopefully the mission will
			provide an opportunity to
			evaluate our newest staff
			officer...
			In the short time she's been
			aboard, Doctor Pulaski has
			distinguished herself as a
			meticulous and competent
			physician. But can someone so
			focused on her own specialty also
			assume the broader duties of the
			ship's Chief Medical Officer?
			... warp drive theory always came
			easy for me, but I'm looking
			forward to some hands on
			experience.
			I'm sure we'll be able to
			accommodate you.
			I know what you mean. It's a
			really electrifying experience
			to be down there where the action
			is. Whenever I push the drive
			past warp six I still get a lump
			in my throat.
			Can I get you another?
			Tell me Commander. Is it the
			custom on the Enterprise for the
			First Officer to wait on
			trainees?
			If they were all like you, I'm
			certain it would be.
			What's it like these days at the
			academy? Is Tsiolkovski still
			teaching Propulsion Theory?
			Are you kidding? They'll have
			to tear down the building around
			him. The first time I saw him...
			Same again.
			Good to see you, Commander. When
			you missed your test this morning
			we all feared the worst.
			My apologies, Doctor. A minor
			crisis...
			in Engineering.
			You know, a Rheinman tissue
			sample sounds a good deal worse
			than it is. I can assure you
			there's no discomfort involved.
			It's not that! It's just... my
			duties are so diverse.
			Suppose we leave the appointment
			open?
			Spontaneity is the sand in the
			clockworks of science.
			But it's just an unimportant
			detail...
			If I didn't consider it important
			I wouldn't insist. Don't force
			me to relieve you of duty to make
			my point.
			You can't be --
			I'll work something out. But
			my schedule is tight for the next
			three or four days...
			So I see.
			Beautiful, isn't it?
			The most beautiful thing I know.
			Picard.
			Captain, this is the bridge.
			We're receiving a distress signal
			on an open sub-space frequency.
			Sound emergency stations, and
			respond on the same frequency.
			Sickbay on full emergency
			status, Captain.
			Stand by, Doctor. Commander
			Data. Have we locked on to the
			signal yet?
			Yes, sir. A voice only
			transmission from the USS
			Lantree, a Federation supply
			ship.
			Lantree, this is Jean-Luc Picard
			of the USS Enterprise. What
			is the nature of your emergency?
			-- can't hold out any -- dying
			-- too many -- help ...
			Sir, we are still recieving their
			signal. There is simply no
			message.
			Lantree! Are you under attack?
			USS Lantree, this is the
			Enterprise, come in, Lantree.
			Replay that last transmission.
			-- can't hold out any -- dying
			-- too many -- help ...
			Counselor?
			Great stress is all I'm able to
			sense.
			Have we got a fix on her?
			Two point two milli-parsecs,
			bearing three-zero at one-four-
			five degrees.
			Number One?
			We better take a look.
			What vessel is it?
			USS Lantree, a class R Starfleet
			supply ship assigned to Gamma
			seven seven, Captain L.I. Taleka
			commanding. Normal complement,
			twenty-six officers and crew.
			Armed?
			Class three defensive only.
			Is she still underway?
			Indeed. She is at maximum speed.
			Alter course to intercept.
			Course to intercept.
			Execute.
			Let's go to Yellow Alert.
			Yellow Alert, sir.
			Engineering?
			Engineering.
			Give us maximum warp.
			Maximum warp, sir.
			Let's show 'em what we've got.
			Go to the backpanels and give
			me a direct reading of the
			dilithium temperature spread.
			What happened?
			My fault, sir. Missed the turn.
			Ensign... maybe you better stay
			in the control room.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Lantree, this is the Enterprise.
			Captain Telaka, this is Picard,
			USS Enterprise. Do you read me?
			No life signs, Captain.
			Nothing?
			Nothing, sir.
			This could be an ambush.
			Force fields up. Arm photon
			torpedoes.
			Force fields up.
			Torpedoes armed and ready.
			Red alert.
			What else have we got in the
			neighborhood?
			No other vessels of any kind
			within two parsecs.
			No battle damage.
			All systems seem functional,
			Captain. Everything is in perfect
			order.
			And no life signs.
			No life signs.
			We're going to have to board her,
			Will.
			The only way we can wind up in
			the same starfield is if you
			bring us out of warp speed at
			precisely the same instant as
			the Lantree.
			First I have to get control of
			the her engines. Very tricky.
			That's why we gave you the job.
			Let me know as soon as you're
			set.
			Will I be on the away team?
			Too dangerous for a valuable man
			like you.
			Fortunately, first officers are
			expendable.
			Just in case we don't make it
			back...
			It was a pleasure.
			I'll man the bridge station.
			Our first problem is to gain
			control of the Lantree's drives.
			Come on. You'll get a chance
			to see what the bridge is like
			on alert.
			Ready to give it a try, Captain.
			First we have to download the
			Starfleet access codes for the
			Lantree...
			Ensign?
			Yes, sir.
			Perhaps you'd like to take a look
			from down here.
			Thank you, Captain.
			We're going in amidships
			protected by an isolation
			forcefield. We'll take one quick
			look. Fifteen seconds. If we
			don't like what we see, we beam
			back immediately.
			We have a lock on the Lantree,
			Commander.
			Okay, let's drop out of warp
			speed. And see if you can keep
			us in the same galaxy.
			Sorry about that. We got as
			close as we could.
			That's okay, Geordi. What's a
			light year among friends?
			If it looks secure at first
			glance, we'll proceed to the
			bridge.
			If we find anyone alive, the
			medical team will beam over.
			Set phasers for kill.
			Let's do it.
			I have the ship's logs, sir.
			Let's see if anbody's home.
			What is it?
			How's the environment?
			No abnormal viral or bacterial
			forms.
			They were carrying passengers?
			He is not a passenger. He is a
			crewmember.
			But he's nearly two hundred years
			old!
			It would seem they all are.
			How old was Captain Telaka?
			Thirty-two earth years.
			Enterprise... this is the USS
			Lantree.
			Enterprise here.
			Captain, the entire crew has been
			wiped out.
			What happened?
			It looks like they were in a
			battle with time, and lost.
			Chief medical officer's log.
			Extensive autopsies performed
			on the crew of the Lantree reveal
			a gamut of primary organ failures
			as the direct cause of death.
			Transporter Room, we're finished
			here. Thanks for your help.
			You're welcome, Doctor.
			Energizing now.
			Captain. We've returned the last
			of the Lantree crew to their
			ship.
			How soon will you have an autopsy
			report, Doctor?
			From everything we can see...
			they all died of natural causes.
			Natural causes? What in nature
			could kill an entire crew at the
			same time?
			For the record Captain, these
			people died of old age.
			Sir, according to the Lantree
			logs the oldest crew member was
			seventy-three, and the mean age
			of the crew was thirty-two point
			six six.
			Doctor?
			Every member of the Lantree crew
			had a complete examination at
			the beginning of their last duty
			cycle just eight weeks ago.
			They were in perfect health.
			Nothing since then? No geriatric
			symptoms reported?
			A single medical entry noting
			that the first officer was
			treated for Thelusian flu five
			days ago.
			Thelusian flu?
			An exotic, but harmless rhinal
			virus. And there was no evidence
			of infection in the first
			officer's autopsy.
			If we don't know what we're
			looking for, how can we be
			certain the Lantree is safe?
			We can't. We'll have to assume
			whatever caused this is still
			aboard.
			Lieutenant Worf. You know what
			to do.
			Sir.
			Captain, the Lantree's last port
			of call was three days ago. The
			Darwin Genetic Research Station
			on Gagarin Four.
			At the very least they deserve
			a warning.
			I was thinking of a quarantine.
			I'll consider that possibility.
			You'll con --
			Captain. If Starfleet had wanted
			you to make the medical
			judgments they wouldn't have
			assigned you a medical officer.
			Number One. Set course for
			Gagarin Four. Warp nine. We'll
			depart the moment our security
			officer returns.
			Codename Firestorm. Access A-D-
			three-three-two-four-nine.
			Federation security code
			recognized. Access confirmed.
			Set auto-destruct. Twenty second
			delay.
			Auto-destruct active. Eighteen
			seconds... sixteen seconds...
			Energize.
			Twelve seconds... ten seconds...
			Cutting it a little close weren't
			y--?
			Find it?
			All set. It was the sensor
			contact.
			-- sensor contact.
			Just like you said it would be.
			Let's get it back in the panel
			and do a quick line test.
			Yes, sir!
			Come with me.
			Running the Engineering Section
			is no different than running the
			drive system. I've got to keep
			everything in balance. To get
			maximum efficiency out of --
			Don't bother, I've heard it all
			before. It's not your problem,
			anyway. It's me.
			That's right. You've got plenty
			of aptitude, but you're
			attitude's not makin' it.
			What do you know about my
			attitude? How'd you like it if
			people always behaved as if
			you're some kind of freak?!
			What do you think this is? My
			ticket to success?
			Wait.
			I'm... sorry. Maybe I'm the one
			who's blind.
			What you are is maybe the most
			talented engineer to come out
			of the Acadamy since... well
			since me. Doing this job's in
			your blood. Now all we've got
			to do is convince the rest of
			'em.
			Deal?
			Deal.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Darwin Station. This is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
			Enterprise, on course for Gagarin
			Four.
			Enterprise, this is Darwin
			Station. I'm Doctor Mandel.
			We've just declared a state of
			emergency here. We need your
			help, but you must stand off.
			Doctor Mandel, what is the nature
			of your emergency?
			To whom am I speaking, please?
			I'm Doctor Pulaski, chief medical
			officer.
			Katherine Pulaski? "Linear
			Models of Viral Propagation?"
			Yes, but that was a long time
			ago.
			And still the standard.
			I'm sorry to meet you under these
			circumstances, but I can't
			imagine anyone I'd rather be
			dealing with.
			Bring me up to speed on your
			situation. What are the factors?
			Rapid onset of geriatric
			phenomena. One hundred percent
			fatal in the advanced stages.
			Presentation?
			Acute arthritic inflammation.
			Pervasive and virtually
			instantaneous.
			Since Darwin is doing genetic
			research...
			Our research, here, is limited
			to human genetics. I assure you
			we're not dealing with some
			mutated pathogen that "got away
			from us." We believe the
			infective agent was introduced
			by a supply ship that was here
			three days ago.
			Doctor, we encountered The
			Lantree a few hours ago.
			They lost all hands.
			That would seem to confirm our
			analysis. Were you able to
			establish a pathology?
			Organ failure consistent with
			advanced geriatric --
			Doctor Mandel! Did you hear what
			I said? The twenty-six men and
			women aboard the Lantree are all
			dead!
			I heard you Captain! And the
			prognosis is alarming. But my
			immediate concern is the
			children.
			Children?
			We have thirty-two children here.
			They've been kept in positive
			isolation since the onset, and
			so far they've shown no symptoms.
			You must evacuate them as soon
			as possible.
			I'm sorry. We'll lend any
			assistance we can, but I won't
			risk the lives of --
			Doctor Pulaski... you've got to
			convince him.
			These children are more than our
			progeny. They represent all our
			years of advanced genetic
			research. If he can't think of
			humanity, think of science!
			I heard you Doctor. And I
			understand completely. We'll
			reach Gagarin Four in a little
			over three hours. Until then.
			I recommend against contact,
			Captain.
			Number One?
			I agree, sir. I wish there was
			something we could do, but the
			risk is too great.
			Doctor?
			As a first step I'd like to bring
			a couple of the children aboard
			and examine them.
			If they're infected... ?!
			Doctor Mandel has assured us they
			are not.
			Counselor?
			Doctor Mandel clearly believes
			the children are safe, but she
			isn't telling us the whole truth.
			I recommend caution.
			The two children could be encased
			in styrolite. They'll be in
			suspended animation. We can scan
			them for possible infection
			without any danger to
			ourselves...
			or to them.
			Until we know what we're facing --
			Exactly. And we won't know until
			we begin gathering data.
			Captain, we're talking about
			saving children's lives. Isn't
			that worth some risk?
			We're always at risk, Doctor.
			You may proceed with your
			examination, but I shall demand
			positive proof that these
			children are harmless before
			placing the lives of my crew in
			jeopardy.
			Approaching Gagarin Four on
			impulse power, Captain.
			Thank you, Mister Crusher.
			Standard orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			Containment forcefield ready,
			Captain.
			Activate.
			Doctor Mandel, are you ready to
			transport?
			You have the coordinates. We
			have one male and one female,
			standing by.
			Transporter, energize.
			A trick!
			Transporter room. Reverse the
			trans --
			Hold on that, Number One.
			Whoever they are, they're in
			stasis. Lieutenant Worf?
			The styrolite's intact, Captain.
			Captain, I...
			There's a definite presence --
			two distinct personalities. Even
			in stasis... It's quite strong.
			They are unquestionably
			telepathic.
			Earth humans. Somewhat larger
			than normal. Approximately
			twenty years old --
			Extraordinary.
			We could be looking at the future
			of humanity.
			Or at least Doctor Mandel's
			vision of it.
			I want to free them from the
			styrolite.
			Are you absolutely certain
			they're safe?
			These children are in better
			health than we are. Their immune
			system is so advanced, it may
			not even be possible for them
			to contract disease.
			But how can we be --
			There's no way we can be
			absolutely certain until we know
			what's causing the disease.
			Then until we can answer that
			question, we can't --
			We don't have that kind of time.
			Captain, look at these children.
			Set aside the fact that they are
			human beings and we are their
			only hope.
			We're talking about a new chapter
			in genetic science.
			But the risk. The risk is --
			Minimal. They'll continue to
			be isolated inside a forcefield.
			Commander Riker, assemble the
			bridge crew in the observation
			lounge in fifteen minutes.
			Doctor Pulaski has a proposal
			she'd like us to consider.
			Yes, sir.
			And Doctor... I'm not one to
			discourage input, but I'd
			appreciate it if you'd at least
			let me finish my sentences once
			in a while.
			You have a minute?
			Of course.
			Deanna... You've known the
			captain for some time...
			I guess I could use some advice.
			I don't think I'm dealing with
			him very well.
			Why do you say that?
			My arguments seem to go right
			past him. We wind up shouting
			regulations at each other.
			It takes time to get to know him.
			But he's very fair, and he has
			excellent judgment.
			I know he's a talented commanding
			officer.
			But he's so caught up in... his
			ship, his responsibility... He
			doesn't seem able to step back...
			to see the whole canvas.
			Kate, I don't think he would be
			where he is if he couldn't see
			the "whole canvas."
			Staff officers report to the
			Observation Lounge.
			Maybe your problem is that the
			two of you aren't all that
			different.
			What do you mean?
			Let's just say you're both well
			established personalities.
			Doctor Pulaski's studies indicate
			the children are harmless. She
			believes the rest of the colony's
			children should be beamed aboard
			and transported to a new
			environment while there's still
			time to save them.
			Are you sure they're safe?
			No.
			In the time we have available,
			the only true test is to expose
			the children to another human
			being.
			I plan to free them from the
			styrolite--inside a forcefield
			containment.
			I'll be inside the containment
			area myself.
			You would risk yourself?
			They're living beings and they
			need our help.
			I don't like it. If we lost the
			force field for some reason...
			we could lose the ship.
			But the children are in perfect
			health. And we can use double
			redundant forcefields.
			As Geordi says, forcefields can
			fail. And until --
			Captain, I can understand your
			concern, but --
			You say you understand, Doctor,
			but I wonder if you do.
			If you can find a way to prove
			the children are biologically
			harmless without risking the
			crew, I'll do everything in my
			power to assist.
			Captain?
			I'm concerned about our CMO.
			She's absolutley obsessed with
			the medical viewpoint. She
			doesn't seem able to step back
			and see the overall picture.
			What's the matter?
			Nothing, Captain. Perhaps you
			and the CMO just need to give
			each other a little more time.
			Doctor Mandel, this is Kate
			Pulaski.
			Doctor? Do you have a decision?
			Yes. I'm afraid it's bad news.
			How can that be?!
			The risk to our ship and crew
			is too great. Until we're
			absolutely certain of the cause
			of the disease, the children --
			But the children were never on
			the Lantree!
			You can't do this! For God's
			sake! I demand that you do
			something to save our children.
			We haven't much time.
			Stand by. I'll get back to you.
			What's the it?
			Our error rate is up nearly forty
			percent.
			You mean: since I came aboard.
			I need your help. I've got very
			little time. I've got to find
			a way to test the children, to
			make sure they're harmless. And
			I need a fail-safe environment.
			The problem is, there's no area
			on the ship that can be sealed
			off with absolute certainty.
			What about the Sickbay?
			Doesn't the Sickbay have
			isolated systems?
			The Sickbay has independant
			systems, but it's not possible
			to totally cut it off from the
			rest of the ship. The only
			truely independent environment
			would be the shuttlecraft, or
			something like --
			The shuttlecraft?
			Why didn't you say so?
			Come.
			Captain, I'd like permission to
			take the children aboard the
			shuttlecraft
			If the experiment is...
			unsucessful, the shuttlecraft
			can simply be abandoned here at
			Darwin.
			And you along with it.
			Doctor, you are the chief medical
			officer of the Starship
			Enterprise. You have a
			responsibility to this ship --
			And to humanity.
			The Starfleet guidelines about
			contact with quarantined --
			Listen, you don't need to quote
			the rule book --
			You were saying?
			Request approved.
			Captain, you said if I...
			Approved?
			Doctor, I can't condone the
			jeopardy you're assumming, but
			I recognize that you have
			satisfied my conditions.
			Thank you.
			Doctor? You sent for me?
			I did, Commander. I assume
			you're qualified to pilot this
			shuttlecraft.
			Certainly. I was trained at --
			I'm sure you were. Please get
			aboard, we don't have much time.
			Doctor, what's going on?
			We're performing the experiment
			aboard the shuttlecraft.
			The captain approved this?
			Yes. Now if you'll clear the
			area, please; we haven't much
			time.
			Doctor, I can't allow you to risk
			yourself like this.
			Captain, this is Riker --
			Commander Riker... that item in
			your medical record is still
			unresolved, if I'm not mistaken?
			What does that...
			You can't be serious.
			Computer, this is Chief Medical
			Officer Pulaski.
			I'm relieving Commander William
			Riker from active duty for
			medical reasons effective
			immediately.
			Let's go.
			All personnel, clear the shuttle
			bay.
			Computer -- override shuttle
			operations! Halt departure!
			Secure the shuttle!
			Riker, William T. Presently on
			inactive duty status. No command
			authorization.
			All personnel, clear the shuttle
			bay.
			You'll take us a few hundred
			meters away from the Enterprise,
			and hold position.
			Begin shuttlecraft launch
			sequence.
			Shuttle Bay One is clear. Access
			hatch sealed. Initiating
			decompression.
			Stand by to open shuttle bay
			doors.
			Decompression complete. Opening
			main shuttle bay doors.
			Good luck, Doctor.
			We are in position, Doctor.
			This is the only way to prove
			they're harmless.
			And if they are not?
			I hate to keep reminding you,
			but you are a machine. You'll
			be perfectly safe.
			That is by no means certain,
			Doctor, but I was referring to
			you.
			Medical research is sometimes
			a risky business, Commander.
			It's all part of being human.
			... Your name is Astarte... this
			is your brother, David...
			All within tolerance, Doctor.
			The manufacturer will be pleased
			to hear it.
			I appreciate your help, but your
			bedside manner needs work.
			There was no warning.
			Doctor!
			Acute arthritic inflammation of
			all joints. It's the initial
			symptom of the disease.
			Good lord!
			The children must be returned
			to their isolation environment.
			Transporter set to original
			coordinates, Captain.
			Energize.
			Glad you're here, Number One.
			Thank you, Captain.
			We'll have a medical team waiting
			for you in the shuttle bay,
			Doctor.
			I'm afraid that's out of the
			question. We still don't
			understand what we're dealing
			with. That means I'm subject
			to the same quarantine as the
			Darwin Station.
			I recommend a delta-level
			decontamination of the Sickbay
			and the shuttle bay. Shuttle
			One out.
			Doctor!
			Captain, I'll see to the
			decontamination myself.
			How do you feel?
			Not exactly up to factory specs.
			The pain is tolerable, thank you.
			Set course for Darwin Station?
			We're already quarantined. What
			do we have to lose?
			I wish it were that simple, Will.
			A meaningless detail on a medical
			form...
			I agree it seems insignificant,
			You have the authority to
			countermand it.
			My authority flows from the chain
			of command. If you, or any other
			officer, have anything less than
			full confidence that your orders
			will be carried out, then my rank
			of Captain is meaningless.c
			Sir, if there's any way I can
			help get them back...
			Of course.
			Captain, Shuttle One is decending
			to Gagarin Four.
			Thank you, Mister Crusher.
			The medical emergency at Darwin
			Station is ongoing. We'll
			continue to assist, but our
			immediate concern is the
			evacuation of our two officers.
			Anyone?
			Shouldn't Kate be involved in
			this?
			Judging from what we saw on the
			Lantree, Doctor Pulaski may not
			be able to help herself.
			I suggest transporting them both
			back to the ship. We should use
			whatever time we have to seek
			the best medical resources
			available.
			The transporter won't protect
			us. The children went through
			the transporter and still
			infected Doctor Pulaski.
			The bio-filter can be adjusted.
			We could alter the filter to
			screen out whatever it is that's
			causing...
			Precisely. We can't protect
			ourselves against the unknown.
			What we need is a filter that
			isn't bio-dependent.
			What about the "trace?"
			The transporter trace?
			The transporter keeps a computer
			record of every transmission,
			a footprint if you will. Usually
			it's only stored for security
			purposes, but if we used the
			trace data to control the
			reconstitution process...
			Is that possible?
			I hate to admit it, but it never
			occured to me. All I can tell
			you is she hasn't been wrong yet.
			Very well. Thank you Ensign... ?
			Excuse me, Captain. But where
			will we get the trace data? As
			far as I know Kate's never used
			the transporter.
			Never?
			She's... a woman of strongly held
			opinions, sir.
			What about a previous assignment?
			Her last ship was the Repulse.
			Bridge. Signal the USS Repulse
			on the sub-space captain's
			priority channel.
			Doctor Pulaski...
			I can only tell you how much I
			regret the burden we have imposed
			on you.
			On both of you.
			Commander Data is an android,
			Doctor. He is unaffected. As
			for me, this was my choice, not
			yours.
			I still can't believe the
			children had anything to do with
			this.
			The evidence is fairly
			conclusive.
			But the children were designed
			to ward off any disease agents.
			I think it's time we talked about
			that.
			Our ultimate achievement.
			Genetically... engineered...
			Created!
			Perfect in every way. Better
			than perfect. Their bone
			structure, their musculature...
			their brains!
			What about their immune system?
			That was our masterpiece. An
			aggressive immunity that attacks
			any invader and destroys it
			genetically.
			That's it.
			Thelusian flu!
			Thelusian flu?
			The first officer of the Lantree
			had Thelusian flu -- an airborne
			virus.
			How would their immune system
			react to it?
			By altering the genetic pattern.
			Forcing the virus into
			extinction.
			I'm afraid that's what's
			happening to us.
			We were so concerned about
			protecting them -- we overlooked
			the obvious!
			The one decision we made with
			our hearts... turns out to be
			a mistake.
			Sorry, Picard. We purged the
			Doctor Pulaski's trace right
			after her transfer. Not that
			she used the transporter much,
			she preferred using the
			shuttlecraft.
			I'd have given her a shuttle if
			it would have kept her here.
			Best CMO I ever served with.
			Tell me, Taggart. If she served
			you as well as you say, why did
			you let her go?
			I guess you haven't run into her
			stubborn streak.
			The moment she heard of the
			opening on the Enterprise, she
			put in a request for transfer.
			Knew your service record backward
			and forward. Apparently she's
			been an admirer of yours for some
			time.
			Extraordinary.
			He's is trying to isolate the
			altered genetic pattern.
			But the computer run could take
			months.
			Not necessarily. Commander
			Data... has a way with computers.
			Comparing genetic samples
			indicates a transposition of
			these two proteins.
			It appears that the antibodies
			have been too effective.
			What do you mean?
			I believe she is referring to the
			fact that the human genome is
			self replicating.
			He's quite right. Every cell
			in our bodies is now programmed
			for extinction.
			Have you made any progress,
			Doctor Pulaski?
			The Darwin staff has amassed some
			amazing new data on the
			physiology of aging --
			I'm sure, but right now I'm
			concerned about you.
			We've isolated the altered DNA,
			but the process may not be
			reversible. The others are
			already at work in the primary
			lab -- where I should be.
			No, Doctor. You and Commander
			Data belong here.
			Commander Data is preparing to
			leave now.
			Doctor...
			Jean-Luc... I appreciate what
			you're trying to do.
			But I got into this by leaping
			before I looked, and I won't
			allow you to make the same
			mistake.
			It's still my responsibility,
			and the quarantine is still
			valid.
			I'm afraid this is the moment
			of truth.
			Chief Medical Officer Pulaski's
			final report to the Enterprise...
			Just as changes in evolution are
			known to be caused by changes
			in the environment, we now have
			evidence that the process also
			works in reverse.
			The quarantine of the Darwin
			Station must be maintained until
			the end.
			Pulaski out.
			I am sorry I could not be more
			helpful, Doctor Pulaski.
			You did everything you could,
			Commander.
			As androids go, you're in a class
			by yourself.
			Doctor --
			Please give my best to the
			captain.
			Enterprise. Commander Data ready
			to beam aboard.
			Sir. Commander Data is back
			aboard.
			Jean-Luc, don't try to carry all
			the weight for this tragedy.
			Kate knew what she was doing.
			If I was certain we had tried
			absolutely every --
			Stand by.
			No life forms present.
			Good to see you, Data.
			Yes, sir.
			Tell me quickly -- you were
			unaffected because you have no
			genetic material?
			Correct, sir.
			And Doctor Pulaski's DNA is
			altered -- and that's what brings
			on the aging?
			Precisely. An almost
			undetectable transposition in
			the human genome. It takes a
			number of interactions of the --
			Come on. We've got one more card
			to play.
			Sir?
			Ensign, I need your opinion.
			Sir?
			You said the transporter could
			be altered to filter out changes
			in Doctor Pulaski.
			If we'd had the trace...
			Well it turns out the changes
			are in her DNA. If we used a
			sample of the doctor's DNA --
			say from a blood test -- that
			was taken before --
			Could we filter out her genetic
			alterations? Absolutely!
			You're picking up some bad
			habits, Ensign, but yes, you took
			the words right out of my mouth.
			Can you make the modifications?
			Of course!
			Make it so.
			Hop to it Ensign. You've got
			work to do.
			Darwin Station, this is the
			Enterprise.
			We may have come up with an
			answer, Doctor. We're looking
			for a sample of your normal DNA
			to use as a filter. We think
			we'll be able to transport you
			while cancelling out any changes
			that have taken place.
			An interesting idea, Captain.
			But what about Doctor Mandel and
			her colleagues?
			Kate.
			If this works -- we may be able
			to use the same technique to save
			ourselves. We have DNA samples.
			A blood test or tissue specimen
			-- anything that would provide
			a sample of Pulaski's original
			DNA.
			Afraid not, sir. Her records
			were shipped by way of Starfleet
			headquarters. They haven't
			caught up with us yet.
			This is ridiculous.
			A single cell! A single --
			This is an emergency! Unlock
			Medical Officer Pulaski's
			quarters!
			Riker, William T., relieved of
			active duty on
			two-three-four-six-nine-point-seven...
			Allow me, sir.
			Anything! Even a fingernail
			clipping!
			Or a hair!
			Doctor... you should know. This
			has never been done before. Are
			you willing to chance it?
			I'll tell you one thing. If I
			live through this...
			I'll have a much better
			understanding of geriatrics.
			Standing by, Captain.
			Ready, Captain.
			The isolation forcefield is in
			place.
			I'll operate the transporter
			myself.
			That's not necessary, sir.
			I'm afraid it is. If something
			should go wrong. If Doctor
			Pulaski is not fully... restored.
			Then she's still capable of
			contaminating the ship.
			In that event there should be
			time to redirect the transporter
			and... disperse her. It's not
			a responsibility I can delegate.
			Don't worry, Captain. It's not
			going to come to that.
			You seem to have absolute faith
			in the ensign's work.
			Like I said, she's never wrong.
			Very well, then.
			Engage forcefield.
			Doctor Pulaski, are you ready?
			I suppose I --
			Captain...
			Welcome aboard, Doctor.
			Doctor... I'm ready to take the
			Rheinman test.
			Glad you reconsidered, Commander.
			This is Chief Medical Officer
			Pulaski. Commander Riker is
			restored to active duty effective
			immediately.
			My schedule's a little tight.
			What do you say we put it off
			for a day or so?
			Captain... If this hadn't
			worked? If...
			It would have been necessary to
			beam your energy into empty
			space.
			Happily, there's no reason to
			concern yourself with --
			Why should I be concerned about
			having my atoms spread across
			the galaxy? I imagine that's
			what's going to happen every time
			I use the damn thing.
			Looks like you'll be going to
			your next assignment with a
			captain's commendation in your
			record.
			Thanks to you. And the way
			you... see things.
			Tell me. When you look at me,
			what do you see?
			To me beauty is a constantly
			changing thing. Sometimes people
			have it and sometimes they don't.
			It all depends on their energy.
			I see your energy and it's
			beautiful. But it comes from
			within.
			You're the only poetic chief
			engineer I've ever heard of.
			And you're the most able trainee
			I've ever met.
			To quote our first officer, "It's
			been a pleasure."
			Technically, I'm off duty.
			Technically, so am I.
			Maybe you'd like to come in.
			I've got a fabulous collection
			of antique star drive drawings.
			Sounds riveting.
			Course and speed set for Star
			Station India, Sir.
			Engage.
