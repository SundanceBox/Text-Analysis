			Commander?
			I'm over here, Geordi.
			What's wrong?
			Something jabbed me in the
			calf...
			O'Brien -- Commander Riker's been
			injured -- lock on and bring him
			up.
			Stand by.
			Geordi, it's just --
			A scratch. Right. Sorry,
			Commander, but we can't take any
			chances. We're the first survey
			team to set foot on this planet...
			we don't know what the risks are.
			What's the hold up, O'Brien?
			The transporter has detected
			unidentified microbes in
			Commander Riker's body.
			Can't the biofilters screen them
			out?
			Apparently not.
			Doctor Pulaski has been notified.
			Acknowledged.
			I didn't want to leave just yet,
			anyway.
			Here's the biofilter's analysis
			of the microbes.
			Not much to go on...
			I can override and beam Commander
			Riker aboard...
			No. I'd better go down and make
			an evaluation there.
			Hmm... I hope these are the right
			coordinates...
			Just kidding, Doctor. I know how
			much you love the transporter...
			About as much as I love comical
			transporter chiefs...
			Fill me in.
			I was walking along, minding my
			own business, making a simple
			geological sweep... and something
			stuck me in the leg.
			Any pain?
			No -- a little numb, that's all.
			Do you know what it was that stuck
			you?
			We've been looking for it, but
			no luck.
			Well, whatever it was, it left
			something behind... I'm going
			to bring you up to Sickbay.
			O'Brien, this is Doctor Pulaski.
			Medical override is authorized.
			Beam us directly to Sickbay.
			Acknowledged.
			I can walk to the table, thank
			you.
			Commander, don't start acting
			heroic.
			Doctor, for personal reasons, I'll
			walk.
			May I ask why?
			I've always had the notion that
			if I was ever so injured that I
			couldn't make it on my own two
			feet... it would be over.
			Medically speaking, that's
			ridiculous.
			You'll get no argument from me,
			but... that's how I feel.
			Whoa --
			This is the strangest feeling.
			My whole leg just went -- dead.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1.
			During a geological survey of
			Surata Four, Commander Riker has
			become infected by an unidentified
			microbe.
			Number One.
			Captain.
			Put your foot where it didn't
			belong, did you?
			The doctor's been getting bored
			lately. I thought I'd find her
			a challenge...
			That you did.
			The commander's nervous system
			has been invaded by an unknown
			microorganism. Not a bacteria,
			not a virus -- but with elements
			of both.
			There's the point of entry...
			The microbes have infected the
			great sciatic nerve... they're
			multiplying at an incredible
			rate.
			There.
			Can you remove it?
			Not surgically. The organisms
			fuse to the nerve, intertwining
			at the molecular level.
			That's why the transporter's
			biofilters couldn't extract them.
			There's no evidence of nerve
			damage, but the organisms are
			impeding nervous function.
			My leg's still asleep.
			Your prognosis?
			The infection is spreading. It
			will eventually reach the brain.
			And if it interfered with neural
			activity there...
			Commander Riker could die.
			How can I help?
			I need to know more about its
			composition.
			And for that, you need a sample.
			Exactly.
			Mister Data, Mister La Forge -- prepare
			to beam down to the planet.
			I must reiterate that it would
			be better if I went alone.
			Don't like my company?
			Your company is not at issue.
			Your vulnerability to this
			microorganism is.
			I'll watch where I step. Besides,
			how do we know that this bug
			doesn't like androids even more
			than it likes humans?
			Possible, but highly unlikely.
			In any event, why risk both of
			us?
			Because I know exactly where
			Commander Riker was when it
			happened.
			He was right over here.
			I detect no animal life within
			fifty kilometers. Merely
			vegetation.
			However, I am reading extensive
			animal remains -- mostly
			fossilized.
			A graveyard?
			I do not know.
			Look at this.
			The structure is rhizomatous.
			Be careful.
			I am always careful.
			It appears to be dead.
			I'm not so sure. I can see
			thermal variations...
			Data, set it down. Let's try
			something.
			Perhaps it likes humans more than
			androids.
			If you are correct, you are
			placing yourself in grave danger.
			I'm counting on those great
			android reflexes of yours...
			I'd say that's what we're looking
			for.
			I would tend to agree.
			O'Brien! Stand by!
			Hold it still.
			Got it. Energize!
			Thanks, O'Brien. Another minute,
			and we'd've been fossils
			ourselves.
			Not precisely, Geordi. True
			fossilization requires several
			millennia.
			Captain, here's your sample.
			Get it to Sickbay right away.
			Report.
			Captain, the commander's injury
			was not accidental. Certain vines
			on the planet evidently seek out
			warm-blooded beings and
			deliberately infect them.
			To what end?
			Unknown. It is conceivable that
			there is a symbiotic relationship
			involved...
			Go on.
			There were numerous animal
			remains in the area, leading me
			to hypothesize that the vines
			could be predatory.
			Then they infect animals in order
			to kill them.
			It is possible.
			For Commander Riker's sake, I hope
			my hypothesis is in error.
			Unfortunately, Mister Data, your
			hypotheses rarely are.
			All negative.
			There's nothing that will cure
			this infection?
			This microorganism is very
			mysterious. I can't even figure
			out what's keeping it alive.
			Or how to kill it.
			Oh, I can kill it... but not
			without destroying the nerves it's
			inhabiting.
			I know you're doing your best...
			My best may not be good enough.
			Comfortable?
			How could I not be comfortable?
			I'm being waited on hand and foot.
			My only worry is that they'll find
			out I'm faking it.
			I wish you were faking it. I've
			seen the thorn, Number One.
			The doctor showed it to me, too.
			Harmless-looking thing, isn't
			it?
			But deadly.
			I'm sorry.
			These things happen.
			When you least expect them.
			I'm surprised they don't happen
			more often. After all, we are
			exploring the unknown.
			And now and then we are humbled...
			reminded that the universe
			contains much that is beautiful...
			and much that is malevolent.
			Captain, I hardly think the vine
			that struck me did so out of
			malice.
			If I've learned anything aboard
			this ship... from our voyages...
			from you... it's that most life
			forms act out of an instinct for
			survival -- not out of evil.
			A worthy lesson. I admire your
			lack of rancor, Number One.
			Captain, if you drop a hammer on
			your foot, it's rather useless
			to get mad at the hammer.
			Anything?
			Not yet.
			Doctor, we're running out of time.
			You're right. I don't need to
			remind you of your duties. I
			didn't mean to give offense.
			None taken.
			Now get out of my hair.
			Aye aye, Doctor.
			This bug's persistent, I'll admit.
			But I'm not worried. We Rikers
			are ornery, too...
			In fact, my great-grandfather was
			once bitten by a rattlesnake.
			After three days of intense pain
			-- the snake died.
			You're a very entertaining
			patient.
			I try.
			Yes. You're making quite an
			effort to be cheerful.
			You of all people should know...
			You feel what anyone in your place
			would feel.
			But I'm the first officer of this
			ship. I have to set an example.
			Even now?
			Now most of all. Deanna, facing
			death is the ultimate test of
			character. I don't want to die
			-- but if I have to, I want to
			do it with a little pride.
			And a lot of impudence.
			You bet. Dying is bad enough --
			but losing my sense of humor?
			Forget it.
			Imzadi...
			I haven't given up yet. The best
			medical team in Starfleet is on
			the case... I'm sure they'll...
			It's spread to the spinal column.
			It's weakening his autonomic
			nervous system.
			Judging by its present rate of
			growth and infiltration pattern,
			the infection will reach his brain
			within an hour.
			Medical log, Stardate 42976.2.
			I can't keep the alien infection
			from spreading to Commander
			Riker's brain.
			Once there, it will kill him by
			dampening neural impulses. The
			only way I can keep him alive
			is to force the neurons to stay
			active -- by stimulating them
			directly with electrical impulses.
			Let's proceed.
			Good...
			Stand by with five milligrams of
			tricordrazine in case of seizure.
			Here goes...
			Tasha? Data? Geordi? Worf?!
			Anybody?!
			We've stimulated random wave
			activity, but the patterns are
			dangerously erratic.
			Hang on, Will...
			The wave patterns are still too
			irregular.
			Why won't they stabilize?
			Wait -- I've found the proper
			amplitude --
			There. The patterns are steadier.
			Is the stimulation preventing the
			infection from taking hold?
			For now.
			The vertex waves indicate a K-complex
			corresponding to an R.E.M.
			state.
			He's dreaming.
			And if you care to enter,
			Commander...
			I do.
			Hello!
			Marvelous how easily humans do
			that, sir. I still need much
			practice.
			There are some puzzles down on
			the planet that Captain Picard
			wants answered. He suggests I
			take you on the away team I'll
			be leading.
			I shall endeavor to function
			adequately, sir.
			Uh, yes. And when the captain
			suggested you I, uh, looked up
			your record...
			Yes sir, a wise procedure always.
			Then, your rank of lieutenant
			commander is honorary.
			No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78;
			honors in probability mechanics
			and exobiology.
			But your files... they say you're
			a...
			Machine? Correct, sir. Does that
			trouble you?
			To be honest... yes, a little.
			Understood, sir. Prejudice is
			very human.
			Now that troubles me. Do you
			consider yourself superior to us?
			I am superior in many ways. But
			I would gladly give it up to be
			human.
			Nice to meet you, Pinocchio.
			A joke.
			Ah! Intriguing.
			You're going to be an interesting
			companion, Mister Data.
			All stations have reported,
			Captain. There seems to be no
			immediate threat to our ship or
			crew.
			In which case, let's hold position
			for a while, Number One. This
			is worth studying.
			Incredible. It's like looking
			off into... infinity, sir.
			Remember the course in ancient
			history at Starfleet Academy?
			Back to the time when men still
			believed the Earth was flat?
			And that the sun revolved around
			the Earth...
			And if a ship sailed too far out
			into the ocean it would fall off
			the edge of the world...
			"Beyond this place there be
			dragons... " It was even said that
			crews would threaten to hang their
			captain from the yardarm if they
			refused to turn back.
			I'm sure no one here has that in
			mind, sir.
			How comforting, Number One.
			But what do I say? How should
			I act? What do I do?
			Guinan, I need your help. Could
			you sit over there?
			That seems simple enough.
			The first words out of your mouth
			are the most important. You could
			start by saying something like...
			... "you're the most beautiful
			woman in the galaxy."
			But that might not work.
			Yes it would.
			If you only knew how much I wanted
			to tell you that.
			But you were afraid.
			Yes.
			Of me?
			Of us. Of what we could become...
			Commander Riker...
			... and that you might have
			thought it was a line.
			Maybe I do think it's a line.
			Then you think I'm not sincere?
			I didn't say that. There's
			nothing wrong with a line. It's
			like a knock on the door.
			Then you're inviting me in?
			I'm not sending you away.
			That's more than I expected.
			But is it more than you hoped?
			To hope is to recognize the
			possibility. I had only dreams.
			Dreams can be dangerous.
			Not these dreams.
			I dream of a galaxy where your
			eyes are stars... And all the
			universe worships night.
			Careful, if you place me too high
			on a pedestal, you won't be able
			to reach me.
			Then I'll learn to fly. You are
			the heart in my day and the soul
			in my night.
			I don't think this is my style.
			Shut up, kid.
			Now, tell me more about my eyes.
			He's relaxed... experiencing
			feelings of warmth. Friendship.
			He's reliving memories. That's
			a natural side effect of the
			neural stimulation.
			Look at this! The organisms'
			metabolism has changed. I wonder
			if the stimulation is affecting
			them somehow...
			I'm going to refocus the impulse
			pattern on the interpretative
			cortex.
			Will that intensify the
			commander's memories?
			Exactly. And we'll see if that has
			an effect on the microbes...
			Everyone! We've brought the
			visitors!
			Please enjoy what we have!
			This will please you. Join us!
			Another time. Thanks.
			Joy and happiness!
			Certainly is.
			The good life, Worf.
			I am not concerned with pleasure,
			Commander. I am a warrior.
			Even Klingons must need love now
			and then.
			For what we consider love, sir,
			I would need a Klingon woman.
			How about plain old basic sex?
			You must have some need for that.
			Of course. But with the females
			who are available to me... Earth
			females... I must restrain myself
			too much. They are quite fragile,
			sir.
			Worf, if anyone else said that,
			I'd suspect he was bragging.
			"Bragging," sir?
			Gentlemen, if this is what you
			call "enhancement" you have a gift
			for understatement.
			What's your name, and tell me you
			love jazz.
			My name is Minuet. I love all
			jazz except Dixieland.
			Why not Dixieland?
			Because you can't dance to it.
			My girl.
			What's a knockout like you doing
			in a computer-generated joint like
			this?
			Waiting for you.
			Waiting for me?!! You can't be
			serious?
			Oh yes, Will -- I've never been
			more serious in my life.
			I am going to have to leave you
			for a while and see to my duties.
			Your work is very important to
			you.
			It is me -- it's what I am.
			Can we dance once before you
			leave?
			Sure, why not.
			How did you learn to dance so
			well?
			From following you.
			I can anticipate your lead. Tell
			me more about your work -- what
			is it about it that consumes and
			enthralls you?
			What an interesting choice of
			words. That's exactly what it
			does.
			You are very fortunate.
			I know that.
			At this point in your life to be
			exactly where you want to be...
			And it's wonderful that you
			realize it.
			I'd be a fool not to know how
			lucky I am to be on this ship
			serving with this group of people.
			It's a dream come true.
			Just like this.
			A dream? Is that what this is?
			Is that what I am?
			I know you are a computer-generated
			image... but your smell,
			the way you feel, your touch, even
			the way you talk and think is so
			real.
			Thank you.
			How far can this relationship go?
			I mean, how real are you?
			As real as you need me to be.
			Something wrong?
			No... it's just that... Commander
			Riker's emotions are rather...
			passionate.
			As in -- erotic?
			Very much so.
			William, is something wrong?
			What do you mean?
			Do you not like girls?
			Of course I like... Oh... is there
			a technique to this foot washing?
			You generally start at the top...
			and work your way down.
			I think I can handle that.
			I was hoping you might.
			I like the way your eyes pick up
			the color of your tunic.
			It's not our place to interfere
			in the domestic affairs of other
			societies.
			But you can interact, can't you?
			Of course. Otherwise, how can
			we learn?
			And that's why you're here,
			tonight, with me... to learn?
			Yes.
			... About our society.
			Yes.
			In our society, it's men who are
			the fortunate ones, enjoying all
			that life has to offer, while we
			women devote ourselves to the
			obligations of making life work.
			In our society we share the
			responsibilities and the pleasures
			equally.
			Don't be defensive. I'd be the
			last to imply that men are
			inferior.
			Or I, that women are. That's why
			I can be here with you while the
			women on the away team go to find
			Ramsey.
			I must remember to thank them when
			they return for giving us this
			time.
			You resist... Why? Do you not
			find me attractive?
			Oh... Yes I find you very
			attractive.
			Don't you feel you know me well
			enough?
			You attract me like no man ever
			has.
			I'm flattered. I don't know what
			to say.
			The organisms responded, all right.
			Their growth rate has doubled.
			Then all we've done is make things
			worse...
			Now we know the organism's growth
			rate is related to the memories
			he's experiencing.
			Or the emotions they produce.
			Different mental processes
			generate different chemicals.
			Perhaps the organisms are
			sensitive to brain endorphins.
			And if some types of endorphins
			attract them...
			... others will repel them.
			I'm going to change the
			differential current pattern and
			see what happens.
			I am Commander William Riker of
			the USS Enterprise.
			I am ARMUS. You are in my space.
			We mean you no harm. We have an
			injured crew in that shuttlecraft.
			We need to get to them. May we
			pass?
			You haven't given me a good enough
			reason yet.
			Preserving life -- all life --
			is very important to us.
			Why?
			We believe that everything in the
			Universe has a right to exist.
			An interesting notion which I do
			not share. You may now leave if
			you wish.
			We won't go without the shuttle
			crew.
			I warn you. You will not like
			it here.
			What are you saying -- that you
			are going to deny us access to
			our comrades?
			I told you what you can do. You
			can leave. I have no interest
			in any further discussion or
			argument.
			Enough. We have people who need
			attention. We will not harm you,
			but we must help them.
			She's dead.
			Status, Doctor?
			Unchanged.
			Can you bring her back?
			I'm trying.
			You've saved people before. You
			can save her.
			Neural stimulator.
			There. You did it.
			No. I've got her on total
			support. There's no independent
			brain activity.
			She's not responding, Doctor.
			Her synaptic network is breaking
			down.
			No! Inject norep.
			We're going for direct reticular
			stimulation.
			Doesn't matter! Do it!
			Neurons are beginning to
			depolarize.
			Increase to seventy microvolts.
			Doctor?
			Eighty-five microvolts.
			She's gone.
			Gone?
			There's too much synaptic damage.
			That thing just sucked all the
			life out of her. There's nothing
			I can do...
			This way.
			You are going to be all right,
			now.
			Where are the others?
			Gone. It's just us.
			Commander!
			There's someone there!
			She's dead. If we'd only gotten
			here a little sooner... !
			Sir, if you indeed have "Q"'s
			power...
			I don't understand. Certainly
			you can't bring her back to life?
			I'm prevented from that by a
			promise.
			It's Ian. Please... please hurry.
			Save him, you must save him.
			What happened? Did he eat
			anything? Did he fall?
			No.
			The child is the source of the
			unusual radiation.
			He said he's the reason the ship
			is in danger.
			That analysis is correct.
			I'm losing life signs.
			Oh, please. Please save him.
			I'm sorry.
			Captain. The containment field
			has stabilized.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Then Ian was right. He was the
			cause.
			Apparently so.
			He is a life-force entity... as
			we passed each other in space he
			was curious and wanted to know
			about us, and he thought the best
			way to learn was to go through
			the process. To be born, to live
			as one of us and in that way to
			understand us.
			Captain, he never meant any harm.
			There was a moment when you
			smiled.
			He said thank you.
			I told him we will miss him -- and
			I will.
			The growth rate has definitely
			slowed. What is he feeling? Can
			you tell?
			Sadness.
			Just the opposite of before --
			and it's having the opposite
			effect on the infection.
			Then your theory is correct. The
			organisms are sensitive to
			different types of endorphins.
			And negative emotions...
			Such as sadness...
			... produce endorphins that inhibit
			the organisms' growth.
			Then we've found a way to repel
			the infection.
			Assuming we're not already too
			late.
			How much time do we have?
			I'm not sure. His vital signs
			are getting weaker. I don't want
			to risk another dose of
			tricordrazine unless I have to...
			I'm refocusing the pattern again.
			We need to isolate memories that
			generate stronger negative
			emotions.
			I am Commander William Riker of
			the Starship Enterprise.
			That is incorrect.
			I don't understand.
			You are Commander Riker, first
			officer of the Klingon Cruiser
			Pagh, or do you intend to
			disobey Federation orders?
			I have no such intentions,
			Captain.
			Exactly where are your loyalties,
			Commander?
			I'm afraid I still don't
			understand.
			This ship is equipped with our
			best weapons and our finest
			warriors. Although we are on a
			peaceful mission we are prepared
			to go into battle instantly.
			I know I can count on every
			Klingon warrior in this crew to
			serve and die in that battle.
			So I ask again Commander Riker,
			where are your loyalties?
			I have been assigned here to serve
			this ship and to obey your orders.
			I will do exactly that.
			Will you take an oath to that
			effect?
			I just did.
			yI-Har-Qo! nep-we' ghaH! (Do
			not believe him! He lies!)
			Hol-chaj yI-jatlh. (Speak in
			their language.)
			This is your second officer,
			Lieutenant Klag.
			Was there something you wanted
			to say to me, Lieutenant?
			Yes sir.
			I don't believe you.
			Then I take it you challenge my
			authority over you.
			Correct.
			And your position in this,
			Captain?
			I would call it your first command
			decision.
			My oath is between Captain Kargan
			and myself. Your only concern
			is how to obey my orders.
			Or do you prefer the rank of
			prisoner over that of lieutenant?
			I will take your orders.
			And you, Commander Riker, will
			obey my orders.
			Agreed, Captain Kargan.
			Ready for your tour, Admiral?
			Quite ready, Commander.
			What's in the case?
			Actually... I brought this for
			Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd
			like you to see it first?
			What is it?
			A form of life. Discovered quite
			accidentally by a survey team on
			a distant uncharted planet.
			Why haven't we heard anything
			about that?
			Oh, you'll be hearing more about
			it shortly. But first there is
			much scientific study to be done.
			After all, this is a superior
			life-form.
			Superior?
			Totally.
			Now come, Riker. Take a good
			look.
			I think I'll summon our science
			officer --
			It won't like your science
			officer. It likes you.
			Now look!
			Vitamins. They do wonders for
			the body.
			Ahh, your life is so painful now.
			But soon you'll be one of us.
			Riker to security. Emergency --
			Touch him and he dies.
			Enterprise, ARMUS has enveloped
			Commander Riker.
			I'm beaming you up!
			If any of you leave now, he dies.
			And so do the survivors of the
			crash.
			We've reduced the growth rate
			even further... but not enough.
			And his vital signs are
			deteriorating.
			But we've isolated the specific
			areas to stimulate. The feelings
			were very primal... survival
			emotions.
			They must be producing a type of
			endorphin that's poisonous to the
			organisms.
			Can you intensify those emotions?
			I can refocus the impulse pattern
			even tighter.
			But I don't know if he can
			withstand it. He's extremely
			weak.
			Do we have a choice?
			No. If we don't neutralize the
			infection within half an hour,
			he'll be dead.
			Medical log, supplemental.
			Commander Riker's condition is
			still critical.
			I've discovered a way to reverse
			the infection's growth rate --
			but I may be too late.
			He's getting weaker, isn't he?
			Respiration shallow, heartbeat
			extremely irregular.
			But we can't delay any longer...
			Take us to our planet -- leave us
			there with our medicine or this
			person dies.
			Don't you see -- I have no choice.
			We were sent to bring back the
			Felicium. The suffering on my
			planet is too great. People are
			dying. It doesn't matter any more
			whether we are entitled to the
			Felicium... we have to have it.
			Let him go.
			Take us there now -- or give us
			a shuttle -- but we must have the
			medicine... if you refuse, this
			person dies.
			I will not be coerced.
			I'll do it. I'll kill him.
			No you won't. You're not a
			killer.
			Commander Riker, those answers
			make no sense.
			You haven't used my first name
			once, Paul.
			You remember it, don't you?
			You don't, because you don't even
			exist. You're a fake -- an image
			of the original! Aren't you?...
			Answer me!
			Report, Number One.
			The image of Rice has been
			replaced by something which is
			hovering several meters away.
			Prepare to beam up.
			Commander.
			What just happened down there?
			Number One! Report!
			Report! Report!
			He can't answer you, Captain.
			Commander Riker has been encased
			in some kind of energy field.
			Is he alive?
			Unknown.
			Who are you?
			The growth rate's down to seven
			percent.
			But the organisms are still
			impairing his neural functions.
			Respiration is erratic, pulse
			grossly irregular, blood pressure
			almost nil.
			Tricordrazine.
			Can we tighten the pattern
			further?
			Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc,
			Captain...
			Recognize Riker, William T.,
			Commander.
			Set auto-destruct sequence.
			Does the first officer concur?
			... Yes. Set auto-destruct
			sequence -- now!
			Auto-destruct will detonate in
			four minutes and fifty-nine
			seconds... four minutes and
			fifty-eight seconds... four
			minutes and fifty-seven seconds...
			Let's go. The only place we can
			stop the count is from the bridge.
			Thirty seconds to auto-destruct.
			Captain, we are clear of the void.
			You may stop the auto-destruct.
			Data, on any heading -- warp six
			-- now!
			Captain.
			I don't believe it, Number One.
			It could still be part of the
			illusion. Data, report.
			All navigational systems confirm
			-- we are at warp six -- on
			course...
			Seventeen... sixteen...
			fifteen... fourteen...
			Firing sequence proceeding, sir.
			Hold fast.
			Eleven... ten... nine...
			six... five... four... three...
			I am Korris.
			We'll handle the formalities later
			-- right now we have to get off this
			ship. Are there any others still
			alive?
			No.
			I believe there is a quicker way
			out of here.
			Let's go.
			Check him Data.
			He is alive -- but just barely.
			Pick him up and let's get out of
			here.
			No. I will carry him.
			As you wish.
			We're out of time, Commander --
			the ship's going to blow.
			Transporter Room, have you got
			a lock on us?
			Not yet. Too much interference.
			You have to get farther away from
			the Engineering section.
			End of the line. Transporter
			Room, we've gone as far as we can.
			Get us off -- now!
			Ship's log, First Officer Riker.
			The star has begun disintegrating.
			Enterprise will be destroyed
			unless it can be moved out of the
			path of the star material
			hurtling...
			... toward us. Our only hope is
			for Lieutenant Commander Data in
			the time we have left, to regain
			his senses and reconnect engine
			power to the bridge.
			Hi, Mister Data.
			Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?
			Data! We need the engines on-line
			in a hurry, remember?
			Oh yes, I remember too.
			So, Data, if you don't mind...
			We've no time for courtesy!
			Get those damned control chips
			back in place, Data! In the
			correct order!
			NOW!
			It's like a game of "how fast can
			you do it?"
			Ah, a game!
			I think I can switch this to the
			Main Viewer, sir...
			We've got eight or nine minutes,
			at most, Data. Can you finish
			by then?
			No. This will take slightly more
			time than we have, sir.
			Dammit, NO! I can't afford to
			get it!
			If we had just a minute more,
			sir...
			We didn't make it, Captain. If
			we had just a minute or so more...
			Yes, then reversing power leads,
			back through the force
			activator... repulser beam hard
			against the Tsiolkovsky...
			We're pushing away!
			Bridge, engage engines!
			The growth rate's almost zero.
			That's not good enough.
			Sickbay to bridge.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			We've eradicated the infection.
			I'm on my way.
			You still here?
			I could ask you the same question.
			How do you feel?
			Beat. You wouldn't believe the
			dreams I've been having...
			Yes, we would.
			You'll be pleased to know that
			we've terminated the infection.
			Great work, Doctor.
			Now, if you'll let me get out of
			here and back to work...
			Lie still. I have a few dozen
			tests to run first.
			Why? I feel fine.
			There may be some residual memory
			loss. I just want to make sure
			you still know who you are.
			Of course I know who I am. I'm
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			USS Enterprise.
			Delighted you're feeling better,
			Captain.
			The admiral and I were worried
			about you.
			Sir, I do not believe you have
			the authority to promote me to
			the rank of admiral.
