			Come in.
			Excellent. Exactly what I need.
			Well, Doctor, and bearing gifts?
			Ale from Ennan Six... your omelets
			deserve no less.
			This is not an efficient method
			for the preparation of sustenance.
			You're right, Data. The ship's
			computer is much more efficient,
			but it lacks the subtlety needed
			for great cooking. It mixes the
			ingredients to precise
			measurements. There's no flair,
			no individuality, and Data, as
			we both know... inspiration and
			flair are the difference between
			artistry and mere competence.
			For much of the history of
			mankind, the breaking of bread
			was a sign of friendship and
			community. Something we have
			gotten away from in the
			twenty-fourth century.
			You have a practiced hand,
			Commander.
			I have my father to thank for
			that.
			Oh, your father liked to cook?
			No, he hated it. It was a chore
			left to me.
			It is my understanding that in
			most human families, the woman
			shares in the cooking.
			There were only the two of us.
			I never knew my mother. She died
			when I was very young.
			Where did you get the eggs?
			During our last stop.
			At Starbase seventy-three?
			Yes.
			What kind of eggs did you say
			these are?
			'Owon.
			A cook's only as good as his
			ingredients.
			Delicious.
			Commander Riker...
			Yes, Captain.
			Would you join me on the bridge?
			On my way.
			We have picked up an automated
			signal from a Federation
			shuttlecraft.
			A shuttle? Out here?! How is
			that possible? We're the first
			manned Federation vessel to enter
			this area.
			Apparently not.
			So what's a shuttle doing out this
			far? And where's the mother ship?
			I don't know.
			Sensors indicate there is at least
			one life-form on board the
			shuttle. Humanoid.
			Perhaps someone to answer your
			questions, Number One. Open
			hailing frequencies.
			Captain, the shuttle is without
			power. Communication is not
			possible.
			Set course to intercept.
			Estimate intercept in three
			minutes.
			Captain's log, stardate 42679.2.
			While traversing an unexplored
			section of the galaxy en route
			to the Endicor system, a
			Federation shuttlecraft has quite
			suddenly appeared -- virtually out
			of nowhere. There are no other
			ships in the vicinity -- and no
			indications whence it came nor
			how it got out here.
			We are closing on shuttlecraft.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Prepare to lock tractor beam.
			Target vehicle -- we will be within
			tractor beam range in two zero
			seconds.
			Set automatic locking device.
			Alert Shuttle Bay Two.
			Locking tractor beam.
			The tractor beam has been locked.
			Number One.
			Worf -- you're with me.
			Doctor Pulaski, you are needed
			in Shuttle Bay Two.
			I have been monitoring. I am
			on my way.
			Well, it's a Federation shuttle
			all right.
			Yet, there are no Federation
			vessels or bases in this area.
			NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS
			Enterprise, shuttle number
			five.
			NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS
			Enterprise shuttle number
			five.
			How is this possible?
			Commander! Come here!
			Captain?
			What is it, Number One?
			Captain, are you on the bridge?
			Where else would I be?
			Right now, I think you had better
			be in Shuttle Bay Two.
			Why? What is it?
			This you had better see for
			yourself and, Captain, bring
			Commander Data.
			We have been in a lot of bizarre
			situations, but nothing like this.
			What's his condition?
			The life signs are confusing.
			I get a strong heartbeat, but the
			rhythm is off.
			Has he been injured?
			No signs of trauma.
			Then why is he unconscious? What
			happened to him?
			I can't say.
			The readings from his brain waves
			are very... strange.
			Strange? In what way? Non-human?
			Artificial?
			No -- neither. They are just out
			of phase.
			Can you revive him?
			I won't attempt it until he's in
			Sickbay.
			Let's get him there.
			Counselor.
			I have never felt anything quite
			like this so it is difficult to
			put into words.
			That person is you. What I mean,
			the person we are looking at is
			as much Jean-Luc Picard as the
			person I am standing next to;
			beyond that there's very little
			of which I am sure. I will have
			to wait until he is conscious
			before knowing more.
			Data, we have to know what is on
			the shuttle's logs.
			Yes, sir.
			Both primary and reserve power
			has been drained from the shuttle.
			I am going to have to connect
			to the Enterprise in order to
			activate the shuttle's systems.
			Lieutenant La Forge -- report to
			Shuttle Bay Two.
			I'm on my way.
			Number One, I'll be in Sickbay.
			Keep me informed.
			Did you see this, Captain?
			It looks like the kind of damage
			caused by an antimatter explosion.
			Yes, the shuttle must have been
			just out of range.
			Data, I need those logs.
			Counselor.
			We'll be on the bridge.
			Resume course and speed.
			Scanners at maximum range.
			Maximum range.
			You should have power now.
			What happened?
			The polarity was not
			compatible.
			Not possible, the connection is
			idiot proof.
			The power requirements of the
			shuttle do not match the
			Enterprise. We are going to need
			a variable phase inverter, to
			align the power from the
			Enterprise to the circuits of the
			shuttle.
			Data, what do you think is going
			on? I don't just mean about the
			shuttle, I mean about all of this?
			I do not have enough information.
			The captain here, the captain
			there. This shuttle -- that
			shuttle. Commander Riker is right -- this
			is very strange.
			This smells like a set-up.
			A trap?
			If it is me, me from where? And
			why in a shuttle? There is
			nothing about this which is random
			or happenstance. Look beneath
			the boards, Counselor; I expect
			something foul and familiar to
			crawl out.
			We have just started doing a
			complete work-up. The vital signs
			are distorted. Some of the
			indicators are totally depressed,
			others are fluctuating wildly.
			I can't explain any of it. But
			he is alive, and I don't think
			he's in any immediate danger.
			The restraints are for his own
			protection.
			Have you been able to determine
			why he is still unconscious?
			I have been able to rule out head
			injury -- otherwise there is no
			apparent cause.
			Wake him.
			What happened?
			Apparently a normal stimulant had
			the opposite effect. I'll have
			to try something else.
			There... that should give you
			something. Making this power
			adjustment is very tricky. By
			all rights, this connection should
			overload all the shuttle's
			circuits.
			Perhaps you had better step back
			out of the way.
			Remember you're not indestructible
			yourself.
			Increase the power.
			Adjust the invert two percent
			positive.
			That's the correct decision, but
			it's having the opposite effect.
			Yes.
			There is nothing I can think of
			which could cause such a radical
			change in this circuit.
			Adjust the invert two percent
			negative.
			Got it. It shouldn't work, but
			it does.
			Data, take a look at the stardate.
			Four-two-six-seven-nine-point-five.
			Captain.
			Go ahead.
			Captain, we have been able to
			activate the shuttle; the on-board
			clock indicates that the shuttle
			is six hours ahead of us.
			Captain, did you read me? If the
			shuttle is from six hours into
			the future, so is the other
			Captain Picard.
			Captain's log, supplemental. Part
			of the mystery has been solved.
			The reason there are two NCC
			one-seven-zero-one-D-five
			shuttlecrafts is because one of
			them is from the future... six
			hours to be exact. And, so
			presumably is the facsimile of
			me.
			Try to wake him, again.
			No!
			It's a only a sedative.
			I know what it is... don't sedate
			him. Let him be!
			Please... allow him to remain
			conscious.
			I have never seen anything like
			this.
			Captain, you had better sit down.
			I'm fine, Doctor... Save your
			ministrations for the patient.
			I want a staff meeting in five
			minutes. Doctor, I assume you
			will want to remain here.
			I will monitor the conference
			from here.
			Keep me informed, Doctor -- of any
			change no matter how small.
			Captain, we have retrieved all
			we are going to get from the
			shuttle logs, including the last
			visual records. Everything before
			this is just a jumble.
			Proceed.
			The distortion is because we had
			to use a phase inverter to
			retrieve the logs. It will
			improve slightly.
			According to the shuttle log, the
			Enterprise was destroyed three
			hours, nineteen minutes from now.
			Captain, we have a portion of your
			last log entry.
			Proceed.
			It's audio only.
			Captain's personal log,
			supplemental.
			For the record... I have just
			witnessed the total destruction
			of the USS Enterprise with a loss
			of all hands, save one. Me.
			That last sound apparently
			occurred when the shuttle was
			thrown back in time.
			All attempts to obtain additional
			information from the shuttle's
			logs have failed.
			At least now we have something
			to go on.
			I can't understand how you could
			end up in a shuttlecraft while
			the Enterprise is being destroyed.
			Nor I, the last thing you would
			do is leave the bridge of the
			Enterprise during an emergency.
			Yes, but let's proceed on the
			premise that what we have just
			seen is factual and that somehow,
			in less than four hours, the
			Enterprise will be destroyed and
			somehow -- although this is
			unfathomable -- I, and I alone
			escaped. Discussion.
			Our destination is the Endicor
			system. We are not due to arrive
			for three days. The charts
			indicate nothing of consequence,
			certainly nothing which could
			threaten the Enterprise, between
			here and there.
			Sensors indicated no other vessels
			-- Federation or otherwise -- in
			this area.
			Data?
			I have nothing to offer. There
			is not enough information upon
			which I can base a hypothesis.
			Well, the shuttle apparently came
			from somewhere up ahead. Rather
			than continuing on this course,
			perhaps we should stop here and
			let whatever is out there come
			and find us.
			I think it's already too late for
			that.
			Are you saying that stopping,
			turning left, or right, or even
			reversing course, is pointless?
			When we brought the shuttle and
			the other Picard on board, we
			committed ourselves to a sequence
			of events which may be
			unalterable.
			Yes, this isn't a rock in the road
			which once seen can be avoided.
			It's much more complex.
			There is the theory of the
			moebius, a twist in the fabric of
			space where time becomes a loop
			from which there is no escape.
			So, when we reach that moment --
			whatever happened will happen
			again... The Enterprise will be
			destroyed, the "other Picard" sent
			back to meet with us and do it
			all over again.
			That sounds like someone's
			definition of hell.
			I know this much -- we can't avoid
			the future.
			Agreed. So let's continue on
			course. Everyone return to your
			duty stations. Somewhere out
			there something will happen...
			a decision will be made which
			will cause me to become separated
			from the Enterprise -- at the time
			that decision will seem correct,
			but it won't be. We have to
			anticipate and not make the same
			mistake once. Something is
			waiting for us out there -- let's
			determine what it is as quickly
			as possible.
			Data -- I think the molecular
			structure of the shuttle has
			changed!
			Your assessment is accurate.
			Why now?
			Perhaps it always was unstable
			and it was only by leaving and
			coming back that you were able
			to see the change.
			Doctor?
			I am beginning to realize just
			how much of the body is held
			together by its own internal
			clock. You -- he was thrown out
			of time, which caused the body
			systems to change their rhythms.
			Slowly, as we move closer to the
			time he left, the internal body
			clocks are realigning.
			You're saying, when our time
			intersects with the time he left,
			at that instant he will be
			functioning normally. And there
			will be two of us.
			Right now, that would be my guess.
			I don't believe that is possible.
			Captain, I am able to feel more
			from him now. Much of his
			emotions are still a jumble,
			but...
			What did you feel?
			Only that he wants desperately
			to leave this ship.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			continue on course to Endicor.
			We are now less than two hours
			away from our rendezvous with
			ourselves.
			Worf.
			All sensors are on maximum scan.
			There is nothing unusual to
			report.
			If the timetable is correct, we
			should get an indication of
			something very soon.
			Bridge, this is Sickbay.
			Yes, Doctor.
			Captain, my patient is more
			coherent.
			I'll be right there.
			Number One, you have the bridge.
			How is he?
			His vital signs are more normal -- which
			is to say, more like ours.
			He is calmer.
			He is now aware of me.
			In some fashion.
			But, does he know where he is,
			and who's here with him?
			I doubt it.
			What went wrong?
			You know... don't you?
			What did you do? What happened?
			Why did you leave the ship?
			Don't turn away. Look at me.
			Picard!
			LOOK AT ME!
			He doesn't understand you.
			He knows I'm here.
			Yes, as part of a nightmare of
			disjointed images, half-heard
			voices. He is in another
			dimension -- seeing us across a
			great chasm -- and he's filled with
			remorse at what he has witnessed,
			and he's afraid.
			What is he afraid of?
			Damn you -- help me! Why did you
			leave the ship?
			It's no use, Captain. He can't
			answer.
			As we get closer to the time he
			left, he may be able to.
			Are you still convinced he is me?
			Yes -- but you're not.
			Not in the slightest. Except for
			his features there is nothing
			about him which I find familiar.
			I want you to stay with him. He
			will be able to communicate with
			you before any of the rest of us.
			I don't know how long anyone can
			take this kind of schizophrenia.
			There has to be a breaking point.
			He is handling it very well.
			He has a lot of anger.
			Yes. Because of what...
			... he represents.
			And what is that?
			Doubt. Seeing him here and
			knowing what happened to the
			Enterprise could make him timid
			or, worse, cause him to hesitate.
			When he said -- that there is
			nothing familiar about him...
			... except his features. It
			sounded like a form of denial.
			It's his accurate feelings.
			Part of my job is to anticipate
			problems. I have a duty to the
			captain, but first to the ship
			and its crew.
			Doctor, the captain is fully
			capable of command decisions.
			Yes... for now. But... this
			situation has put enormous
			pressure -- of a unique and very
			personal nature -- on Captain
			Picard. And we both know that
			pressure is going to increase.
			You said he already has doubt.
			Yes, which is necessary and
			healthy.
			But could potentially paralyze.
			If we begin to see signs that he
			is acting in an irrational manner,
			then I have the authority and the
			duty to relieve him.
			I do not think that will be
			necessary.
			I hope you're right.
			What force or phenomenon could
			cause a shuttle to be thrown back
			in time?
			None that we have ever
			encountered. In theory,
			accelerating beyond warp ten.
			Using the gravitational pull of
			a star to "slingshot" back in
			time. Is that what happened here?
			The shuttle doesn't have warp
			capability.
			No. Some external force was
			needed.
			We have never encountered any
			natural force that powerful. And
			why only six hours? Why not a
			day? A year?
			Are you suggesting there is a
			conscious mind at work here?
			There is no evidence either way.
			The Traveler moved through time
			with the power of his mind.
			I don't think that's the case
			here.
			No -- and Manheim's experiments
			with gravity and time were
			rudimentary, and uncontrollable.
			Captain, this is one instant
			where you must suppress your
			natural tendencies.
			Explain.
			Your strength, Jean-Luc, is your
			ability to evaluate the dynamics
			of a situation, step in and make
			the definitive, preemptive move.
			You take charge. You're
			frustrated now because, not only
			can't you see the solution... you
			can't even define the problem.
			Go on.
			This is not place or person we
			are facing... at least not yet...
			it's time.
			Are you telling me to just sit
			down -- shut up and wait.
			I wouldn't have used those exact
			words... but, yes.
			I don't do that well.
			It's your Persian Flaw.
			Yes -- perhaps it is.
			Captain to the bridge.
			Report.
			This energy vortex appeared out
			of nowhere. There was no warning.
			Well, now at least the waiting
			is over.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			waiting is over. We have
			apparently intersected with...
			something.
			It is similar to our tractor beam,
			only much more powerful.
			Bridge, this is Engineering.
			This is the bridge.
			The pull on the Enterprise is
			steady. I am having to hold the
			warp engines at thirty percent,
			in order to maintain this
			position.
			Transfer engine control to the
			bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			There is a consciousness here,
			Captain. Not thought -- it is more
			like instinct.
			What do you make of it, Number
			One?
			I would say we're being probed.
			The beam is coming directly from
			the center of the vortex. Sensors
			show only massive amounts of
			energy.
			What is it trying to learn?
			I think it is trying to determine
			if we are a life force.
			We should stay and investigate.
			Agreed.
			But, was that the mistake?
			... staying too long.
			Possibly.
			We should go now.
			Well...
			It's the prudent move.
			I never thought I would hear
			myself say something like that.
			Under the circumstances -- I think
			you may be right.
			But you'd rather stay and find
			out what it is? What is its
			intent?
			Engineering, transfer to bridge.
			Lieutenant La Forge.
			Yes, sir.
			See if you can get us out of here,
			Mister La Forge. Maximum warp.
			Aye, sir.
			I have set velocity to warp nine.
			Engage.
			The warp engines are at ninety-one
			percent.
			Put it to the wall.
			Aye, sir.
			I can't hold it.
			Captain! The engines can't take
			this strain.
			All stop.
			Status.
			All decks have reported... no
			damage -- no injuries.
			The pull on the Enterprise is
			steady, but much stronger than
			before. I am at warp seven just
			to hold this position.
			Everything we do tightens its
			grip. Let's see what we can
			learn. Launch a Class One probe.
			Aye, sir.
			That was personal.
			Captain -- the power drain needed
			to hold this position is enormous.
			How long can you maintain it?
			A few minutes, then we are going
			to have to shut down again.
			Captain -- some kind of energy has
			just surrounded my patient.
			Is he still alive?
			Yes...
			Arm photons, Mister Worf, and lock
			them on the center of the vortex.
			Photon torpedoes locked on
			target.
			Hold.
			We're like a rag in a dog's mouth.
			I am now at maximum warp.
			It's you, Captain. It was the
			entire ship, but now it has turned
			its attention completely on you.
			Captain, I can't hold it. If we
			don't shut down, we are going to
			explode.
			Counselor, what if I were to leave
			the Enterprise? Would its
			attention stay focused on me?
			Yes. I think it would.
			You'd never survive.
			But, maybe in those few seconds -- the
			Enterprise could break free.
			In any case, that's what he...
			the other Picard... must have
			thought.
			Captain, where are you going?
			Prepare a shuttle, Number One.
			You're leaving the ship?!
			I have to make a stop in Sickbay.
			We may be on a road which has no
			turns.
			He's very agitated.
			I must get to the shuttle.
			I know.
			Do you know where you are?
			The Enterprise.
			But you're only vaguely aware of
			it. And me -- do you know who I
			am?
			No. You don't.
			I must go.
			Release him.
			Do you know what you are doing?
			No -- release him!
			Security to Sickbay.
			No. Security, this is the
			captain -- disregard that order.
			And clear all personnel -- repeat,
			all personnel -- from Shuttle Bay
			Two. I don't want any
			distractions. You...
			... stay here.
			You have made the decision to
			leave the ship?
			I must.
			Why?
			The energy in the vortex wants
			me.
			You're certain.
			Yes... it's an entity -- a
			life-form which recognizes the
			Enterprise as an entity with me
			as the brain, and it wants me.
			Shuttle Bay Number Two.
			What's your other option?
			This is our only chance. If I
			leave, it might be distracted long
			enough for the Enterprise to
			escape.
			You are wrong. Leaving won't save
			your ship. Don't you remember?
			It was destroyed -- you saw it
			happen.
			If I don't leave the Enterprise,
			the ship will be destroyed.
			If that's true, then help me.
			We want the same thing. We want
			the Enterprise to be safe.
			There has to be a piece of
			information which I don't have.
			What is it?
			It's me.
			You?
			Captain.
			Yes.
			We are about to lose warp drive.
			Understood.
			When you say it's "you," do you
			mean it's still you? And it's
			not me -- just you. Has this
			entity singled you out -- somehow
			making a connection?
			You're confusing me. We're
			almost out of time.
			I must get to the shuttle.
			Wait. You can -- I'll let you,
			hell, man, I'll go with you, but
			first tell me. What is -- what
			was, your other choice?
			Stand aside.
			You don't know what I'm talking
			about. You're frozen with a
			single thought -- unable to change -- unable
			to alter any part of your
			previous actions.
			I must leave -- there's no other
			way.
			There must be.
			Only one -- but it would never
			work.
			What is it? What would never
			work?
			Better to sacrifice myself than
			destroy the Enterprise.
			Destroy the Enterprise -- how?
			I have to leave.
			Tell me -- what was your other
			choice? We can't escape it -- we
			can't fight it, we can't go
			forward.
			No -- no... We can't go forward,
			it would destroy the Enterprise.
			Was that it... Was that the other
			choice?
			I must leave.
			No.
			I can't allow it. Before we have
			any chance of moving forward, the
			cycle must end.
			Doctor Pulaski -- report to Shuttle
			Bay Two.
			Bridge.
			Number One, we have been wasting
			our energy trying to escape. It
			only weakens us.
			Helm, set a course for the center
			of the vortex. Lieutenant La
			Forge, on my command -- I want all
			the power you can muster.
			Yes, sir.
			We are going into it?
			Yes.
			Course set.
			Everyone hold your position -- no
			matter what. ENGAGE!
			What's our position?
			We are back on course to Endicor.
			Stand down from Red Alert.
			Bridge, this is Shuttle Bay Two.
			The other Picard and the shuttle
			are gone.
			Explain.
			They just... vanished.
			All decks have reported in. No
			damage -- no casualties.
			I want a complete check -- all
			systems.
			Yes, sir.
			You have the bridge, Number One.
			Lots of questions, Number One...
			... and damn few answers.
			Everything about it seemed a tick
			off.
			He certainly did not act like me,
			at least not the way I think I
			act.
			Maybe none of it was real... we
			could have just been part of a
			shared illusion.
			Or maybe "he" was thrown back in
			time so that we would be able to
			take another road... make another
			choice?
			That suggests a moral force,
			giving us the opportunity... or
			specifically giving you the
			opportunity to right a wrong.
			It's said... if you travel far
			enough you will eventually meet
			yourself.
			I will tell you this... it's a
			very unnerving experience, one
			I hope never to repeat.
			Come.
			I know you were all disappointed
			with my last culinary effort.
			Not all.
			Thank you, Worf. Anyway,
			considering the stress of the last
			few days, I thought we could use
			a little diversion and at the same
			time I could make amends for the
			'Owon omelet.
			So what are you preparing?
			The specialty of the house,
			Alaskan stew.
			Not with ingredients you picked
			up at Starbase seventy-three?
			No -- I had the computer fabricate
			everything. The potatoes, the
			onions, the flour, and the meat.
			Meat? What kind of meat?
			Ahh... Well, to be authentic I
			needed moose. But, I couldn't
			find the specific molecular
			pattern for moose, so I had to
			improvise. The computer came
			close...
			... actually, it's somewhere
			between venison -- musk ox -- and
			Kobe beef.
			I thought that humans had long ago
			given up the practice of raising
			animals for food.
			There were a couple of winters
			when it was either starve or hunt.
			How fortunate.
			I'll give you this -- your stew
			smells a lot better than the eggs.
			This is quite good.
			Agreed.
			No good, Worf.
			I appreciate the effort, I would
			have preferred another omelet.
			Sorry. I used the last of 'Owon
			eggs.
			Thank goodness.
