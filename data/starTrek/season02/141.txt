			Captain's log, Stardate 42680.3.
			We are the first manned vessel
			to enter the Selcundi Drema
			quadrant. Previous unmanned
			probes have recorded unusual
			levels of geological activity
			in all five planetary systems.
			I am hoping the Enterprise will
			find the answer to this engima.
			Commander, I have been reviewing
			the unmanned probe scans. In the
			past one hundred and fifty years,
			the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema
			has shattered, forming an asteroid
			belt.
			I'd call that geological
			instability.
			Is there any indication that this
			is the work of an unknown
			intelligence?
			I think this is geology, not
			malevolence. These planets live
			fast and die hard. The question
			is why.
			You're sure you won't reconsider?
			No, I'll watch you and be
			impressed.
			An optimistic vote of confidence
			from the non-rider.
			I've never thought of you as
			particularly an animal person.
			Small animals, no, but horses --
			Computer, program Holodeck for
			a woodland setting with a bridle
			path and an appropriate mount.
			Type of mount? Andorian Zabathu,
			Klingon Sark --
			A horse, an Earth horse.
			Breed?
			Arabian.
			The Arabs believed that Allah
			gathered the south wind and made
			the horse.
			On the Holodeck we've made that
			legend come true.
			I like that. Oh yes, computer,
			English tack, and I will control
			the animal myself.
			Acknowledged.
			Hello, my beauty.
			So you like horses for the
			romance?
			It goes deeper than that. A fine
			war mare would sleep in a
			bedouin's tent, carry him into
			battle, feed his children with
			her milk. There is a bond which
			forms from mutual need.
			Now I understand. You don't want
			the comfort of a pet. You want
			a companion.
			I had a Betazoid kitten once. My
			mother and the cat reacted...
			badly to one another.
			Captain, my mother and I share
			a bond. She is going through a
			difficult time, and I may need
			to be with her.
			If you want leave, you need only
			ask.
			Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.
			You're sure you won't try? It's
			a good way to relax. We can get
			you something quiet and gentle.
			No, no. I prefer a mode of
			transportation that doesn't have
			a mind of its own.
			Strange. I should have thought
			that Betazoids would be
			outstanding animal trainers.
			We become too involved in the
			thoughts and shifting passions
			of the beast. We lose our way
			and become swept up in
			emotionalism.
			I should think the shifting
			passions of...
			... this beast would be
			far more terrifying.
			Captain.
			Yes, Number One?
			We've entered the first system.
			I think you might want to come
			to the bridge.
			Something interesting?
			Spectacular and a little
			terrifying.
			On my way.
			Later, old girl.
			This is our first long-range
			reading, extremely high
			magnification.
			Quite impressive.
			And deadly. The last unmanned
			probe showed a thriving
			ecosystem. Now there's nothing.
			This is Commander Riker's meeting.
			I need your advice and
			recommendations. I was given the
			responsibility of overseeing
			Wesley's education. To further
			that goal I want to put him in
			command of the planetary mineral
			surveys.
			This is a big job with a lot of
			responsibility.
			The game's not big enough if it
			doesn't scare you a little.
			To do the job, Wesley's going to
			need a team. It takes command
			presence to lead. Is he ready
			for that?
			Leadership grows from
			self-confidence which is also
			part of a Starfleet officer's
			education.
			All of this is true, but there
			is an old horse trainer's adage
			about putting too much weight on
			a young back -- we don't want him
			to break under the pressure.
			We seem to be shifting the focus
			here. Are we talking about a
			young officer on the fast track
			to the Academy or are we talking
			about guiding a young man through
			adolescence and into adulthood?
			Both.
			You can't guide someone into
			adulthood. The experiences are
			unique to each person. Whether
			Wes succeeds or fails, he will
			learn from the experience.
			I agree. I'm just questioning
			the speed at which we're moving.
			You think we're pushing him too
			hard?
			It's a valid concern.
			Tempering is done in extremes.
			He's a boy, not a sword.
			Who will someday be a man and
			need a fine edge that will hold,
			that won't dull at the first
			touch of resistance.
			Sooner or later he's got to feel
			the burden of command.
			Mister Crusher to the Observation
			Lounge.
			Wesley, I'm placing you in
			command of the planetary mineral
			surveys.
			Sir! Um... thank you, sir.
			You may not thank me once you see
			how much work it entails.
			Assemble your team, and take a
			look at the records on the Drema
			quadrant. We've got a mystery
			to solve here.
			Yes, sir. A team, sir?
			Ensign, this is a serious
			responsibility.
			I know, sir.
			These officers are here to assist
			you. Not judge, but help. I
			suggest you use them; they are
			a valuable resource. And by the
			way, I have more respect for an
			officer who knows when to admit
			ignorance and ask a question than
			one who, out of pride, will
			blunder blindly forward.
			I understand.
			You're dismissed, Mister Crusher.
			I'll try not to disappoint you
			Is this part of your regular
			duties?
			No, a personal project. I have
			just reset the sensors to scan
			for frequencies outside their
			usual range.
			Such as?
			The dips and peaks of the galaxy's
			magnetic field, organic molecules
			in nebular clouds, energetic
			cosmic rays.
			Interesting. Would these scans
			also detect artificial
			transmissions as well as naturally
			occurring signals?
			Of course.
			Good.
			Those signals are very faint and
			difficult to distinguish from
			background noise, which is why
			I am boosting the power.
			I will be removing this equipment
			to my quarters.
			Good!
			Hi, may I walk with you? I need
			a little advice.
			Yes.
			And it's free.
			Walking or advice?
			Both.
			It's about my team. I'm
			considering so many factors I'm
			confusing myself.
			What have you done so far?
			Broken down the task and picked
			the best people in those
			disciplines.
			Who have you got so far?
			Prixus for mineralogy and
			metallurgy, Alans and Hildebrant,
			volcanology and geo-mechanics,
			and I want Davies for geo-chemistry,
			but --
			But they're all older than
			you?
			Yeah, it makes me feel awkward.
			And what about compatibility --
			Completely irrelevant. They're
			professionals. And if there are
			personality conflicts, you resolve
			them. You're in charge.
			So you not only have to understand
			the job, you have to be a ship's
			counselor.
			Sometimes.
			Well, thanks.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42680.7.
			We are entering the second
			Selcundi star system. I believe
			the volatility of these planets
			originated in the primordial gas
			cloud which formed them five
			billion years ago.
			Computer, identify.
			Sensors indicate low-level R.F.
			waves.
			Is there a pattern?
			Affirmative.
			Naturally occurring?
			Negative.
			Key universal translator.
			Unable to comply. Weak signal.
			Lock on com link and boost.
			Lock on complete.
			Read.
			Working.
			Ensign Davies?
			You got him.
			Wesley Crusher.
			I've been put in charge of the
			planetary survey, and I'd like
			to have you on the team.
			Sounds great. Who else is on it?
			Prixus and Hildebrant and Alans.
			It's a shame you didn't talk to
			me first. Personal opinion, but
			I like to break up married teams.
			Oh, I hadn't thought about that.
			Don't worry, they'll probably work
			out fine.
			And if you need any help, just
			give me a signal and I'll take
			over for you. We don't want you
			getting too beat up on your first
			command.
			Uh... thanks, but I think I'll
			be okay.
			Analysis complete.
			Enhance.
			Is anybody out there?
			Yes.
			Wes.
			Hi, Doctor Pulaski.
			Is there trouble behind that door?
			My team's in there. I've got to
			assign planets, set a schedule.
			Sounds like you've got everything
			under control.
			But I haven't had to deal with
			them. Not all together. Not
			professionally.
			Wes, the minute you walk through
			that door they're your team. You
			don't have to prove a thing.
			You've got the authority.
			Only because Commander Riker says
			I do.
			It's up to you to hang on to it.
			You better get in there.
			And for whatever it's worth, I
			think you're going to do just
			fine.
			Or not.
			It has been six weeks since our
			entrance into the Selcundi Drema
			quadrant. Each system has
			revealed the same disturbing
			geological upheavals on every
			planet.
			Program complete. Enter when
			ready.
			Feels good, doesn't it? You're
			a lovely darling.
			I agree. Nice job.
			Here are the results of my scan
			of the third Selcundi system.
			Just the same old song.
			Didn't you tell me that U.V.
			absorption readings like these
			are indicative of traker deposits?
			And where there's traker there's
			generally dilithium? Yeah, I did.
			Then don't you think we ought to
			run an Ico-spectrogram?
			Those tanker readings are really
			faint. It's probably a fool's
			echo.
			I think I'd still run the
			Ico-gram.
			Wesley, it's a major undertaking
			to set up that scanner.
			We're looking at five hours -- minimum.
			I know, I just don't want to do
			the job halfway.
			Wes, there's being thorough and
			then there's wasting time. It's
			also the mark of a good officer
			to recognize the difference.
			Well, maybe you're right.
			Access all volcanic and tectonic
			plate activity of Drema Four.
			Accessing.
			Computer, locate Captain Picard.
			Captain Picard is on Holodeck
			Three.
			I am sorry to disturb you,
			Captain.
			Quite all right. It must be
			important, or you wouldn't be
			here.
			Yes, Captain, it is important.
			Very. Eight weeks ago I received
			a transmission -- a simple four
			word message: "Is anybody out
			there?" I answered it.
			I could not help myself.
			There is a loneliness inherent
			in that whisper in the darkness.
			Yes, I am glad that you
			understand.
			But it didn't stop there.
			No. I have been drawn into her
			life.
			To what degree is this
			involvement?
			We have been communicating
			regularly.
			Dear heaven, you've got a pen pal.
			Does this society have any idea
			that there is interstellar life?
			No.
			Merde. Just where does she think
			you're calling from?
			I have kept that somewhat vague.
			But Sarjenka has been quite
			specific, telling me detailed
			stories of her family and friends.
			It was fascinating, but among
			these confidences were interspersed
			alarming references.
			Go on.
			Captain, Drema Four is enduring
			the same geological stresses we
			have found in the other systems.
			Then your pen pal is in trouble.
			Yes, sir.
			What are you proposing?
			If we can determine the cause of
			the geological instability, we
			might be able to reverse the
			process.
			And violate the Prime Directive.
			I was hoping that you might have
			an option.
			We don't even know if this
			catastrophe is preventable.
			Call a conference in my
			quarters. All senior
			staff.
			Yes, sir.
			And Data, all communication with
			this life-form must stop.
			Yes, sir. I understand.
			Will you excuse me?
			You have the look of someone who
			didn't come up here to relax.
			No, sir, I need your advice.
			Yesterday Ensign Davies turned
			in his survey results. I thought
			he should run an Ico-spectrogram.
			He didn't agree.
			Did you think you were right?
			Well, yeah, I guess. Or I could
			have just been picking nits.
			Or perhaps intimidated? It's
			tough to tell people what to do.
			I suppose I could have made it
			an order, but that's the hard
			part. How do I give orders to
			somebody older and more
			experienced then me?
			Your and Davies's relative ages
			aren't the issue here. Are they?
			I guess not.
			Do you think it might have
			something to do with ego?
			Maybe the opposite of ego. Every
			time I give an order, there's this
			part of me that's asking what
			makes my judgment so superior to
			this other person's.
			Wes, authority and responsibility
			go hand in hand. I know you're
			responsible, now you have to learn
			to handle authority. You've been
			put in command so you can make
			a few right decisions. That will
			establish a pattern of success
			and build your self-confidence.
			That's why I said this was about
			ego. If you don't trust your own
			judgment, you don't belong in the
			command chair.
			But what if I'm wrong?
			Then you're wrong. It's arrogant
			to think you'll never make a
			mistake.
			But what if it's something really
			important -- not just a mineral
			survey, and what if someone ends
			up dead because of my mistake?
			In your situation you only have
			to do one thing: Ask yourself,
			what would Picard do?
			He'd listen to all the opinions,
			then make the decision. But he's
			Picard.
			Doesn't matter. Would anyone
			argue with the captain once his
			decision was made?
			No way.
			Why not?
			I'm not sure.
			Commander Riker, report to the
			captain's quarters.
			When you've worked it out, you'll
			understand command.
			On my way.
			I hope I've helped. Let me know
			what you decide.
			I've already decided. I'm going
			to have Davies run that Ico-gram.
			And thank you, sir.
			You're welcome.
			Hey, Wes, hi.
			Ensign Davies, I want that
			Ico-spectrogram run on the Selcundi
			Drema system.
			You got it.
			You see the dilemma?
			There are no options. The Prime
			Directive is not a matter of
			degree. It is an absolute.
			I've always had a problem with
			that kind of abstract
			intellectualizing. It seems very
			callous and even a little
			cowardly.
			Doctor, I'm sure the lieutenant
			did not intend it in that way.
			In this situation we must use
			caution. Our actions could have
			a profound effect upon the future.
			If we could see all possible
			outcomes --
			We would be gods, but we're not.
			If there is some cosmic plan,
			isn't it the height of hubris to
			presume that we can, or should,
			interfere?
			So what are you saying? That the
			Dremans are fated to die?
			It's something that needs to be
			considered.
			Well, consider it considered, and
			rejected.
			If there is a cosmic plan, are
			we not part of it? Our presence
			at this place at this moment in
			time might be part of that fate.
			So it might be part of the plan
			that we interfere.
			I think that eliminates the idea
			of "fate."
			Commander, remember "Human
			reason needs only to will more
			strongly than fate, and she is
			fate."
			Doctor, you quote Thomas Mann,
			and Commander Riker could no doubt
			cite Euripides to support his
			position, but all of this is just
			philosophy. Sarjenka is not a
			subject for philosophical debate,
			she is a person.
			He's got a point. The Prime
			Directive was designed to protect,
			not destroy.
			So Doctor, you draw the line at
			the death of millions.
			Yes.
			Same situation if it's an epidemic
			rather than a geological
			catastrophe?
			Absolutely.
			How about a war? A
			generations-long conflict that
			is killing millions. Do we
			interfere?
			Now we're less secure in our moral
			certitude. And what if it's not
			death. What if it's an oppressive
			government which is enslaving
			millions?
			The Prime Directive serves many
			purposes. Not the least of which
			is to protect us. It keeps
			us from allowing our emotions to
			overrule our judgement.
			My emotions are involved. Data's
			friend is going to die. That
			means something.
			To Data.
			Does that invalidate the
			emotion?
			If the Dremans asked for our help?
			Yes, Sarjenka's transmission could
			be viewed as a call for help.
			That's sophistry and you know it.
			Hell, I'll buy that excuse. We're
			all jigging madly on the head of
			a pin anyway.
			She cannot ask for help from
			people she does not know.
			She knows me.
			What a perfectly vicious little
			circle.
			I want you to sever the remaining
			com link with Drema Four.
			Captain, to maintain contact
			without subspace radio capability
			required the computer to remotely
			scan all subspace resonance in her
			area. If I break that link the
			probability of relocating her
			signal falls to one in twenty-three
			million...
			We are going to allow her to die,
			are we not?
			Data, Data! Where are you? Why
			won't you answer? Are you angry
			me? Please, please, I'm so
			afraid! Don't leave me!
			Wait.
			Oh, Data.
			That whisper in the dark has
			become a plea. We cannot turn
			our backs.
			We've found the reason for the
			geological instability.
			Excellent.
			We would have missed it if Ensign
			Crusher hadn't requested an
			Ico-gram, but he did, and...
			Drema Four has the largest deposit
			of dilithium ore ever recorded.
			It's also laid down in a very
			unusual pattern. The crystals
			are growing to form perfectly
			aligned lattices.
			The ore is forming generator
			strata.
			Which creates a piezoelectric
			effect.
			In plain English this means that
			the dilithium is causing the
			geological catastrophe?
			Right, the crystals take the
			natural radiant heat of the planet
			--
			Focus it, and turn it into
			mechanical energy.
			That increases tectonic stresses
			--
			Excuse me, those plates are mine.
			Stick to your volcanos. Anyway
			the stress tears the planet
			apart.
			Then the crystals break down,
			which is why we found all these
			traces of Illium-629.
			All right, we know the why. Now
			what can we do?
			That's going to take a little more
			work.
			Can we reverse the process?
			We think so.
			No theories or half answers. Yes
			or no.
			We'll get to work on it.
			Sir.
			Data's out there...
			... monitoring conditions on
			Drema Four. The situation's
			becoming pretty desperate for his
			friend. He's calculated the
			safest locations on the planet's
			surface. You can guess why.
			We just keep getting in deeper
			and deeper, don't we?
			She's going to die. They're all
			going to die.
			Unless.
			Yes... unless.
			You may tell Commander Data that
			he has my permission to contact
			his friend and guide her to a
			safer location.
			Do you know where we are now,
			Number One?
			Sir?
			Up to our necks.
			Sarjenka, this is Data. Respond
			please.
			Unable to complete transmission.
			Reason for failure?
			Damage to remote receiver on
			planet's surface.
			We are modifying Class One probes
			so they become resonators. We
			will then use torpedo casings
			to protect the probes once they
			begin burrowing beneath the
			surface.
			How do these resonators destroy
			the crystals?
			By emitting harmonic vibrations
			which will shatter the lattices.
			The Enterprise will monitor and
			adjust the frequency of the
			resonators.
			It sounds like a plan. Get
			started on it.
			Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
			Captain, permission to beam down
			to Drema Four.
			What?
			I have been unable to contact
			Sarjenka.
			I know you're worried, but
			transporting to the surface is
			only going to make a bad situation
			worse.
			I feel it is important to
			determine the reason for --
			Come on, Data!
			Sir, your orders were to deliver
			the message, correct?
			Yes.
			So what is the difference whether
			I send the message or deliver it
			personally?
			A whopping big one, and you know
			it.
			We have come this far.
			In for a penny, in for a pound,
			is that what you're saying, Mister
			Data?
			Oh hell.
			Go.
			Sir?
			Go. Handle the transport, Number
			One.
			Now where would you say we are?
			O'Brien, take a nap. You didn't
			see this, you're not involved.
			Right sir, just standing here
			dozing off.
			Ten minutes, Data, that's it,
			and if you meet anybody but
			Sarjenka --
			I will signal for immediate beam
			out.
			Commander Riker to the bridge.
			Damn!
			I just woke up, sir.
			You know what to do?
			No problem. I'll have him out
			of there as smooth as ice.
			Sarjenka, wait!
			Do not be afraid. I am Data.
			Data.
			Data, you came.
			Data, where have you been?
			There is no time for explanations.
			You and your family must leave.
			We already have. We ran when the
			tremors began.
			Then why are you here?
			My father wouldn't let us take
			anything, but I had to have my
			transmitter. I knew you would
			come back, and I didn't want you
			to find only silence -- the way
			I did.
			Yes, well, I am sorry about that,
			but it is very complicated -- Does
			your family know where you are?
			No.
			You cannot survive in this.
			What are we going to do?
			Enterprise, two to beam up.
			Where are we going?
			To the stars?
			Yes.
			There's gonna be hell to pay.
			Where is Commander Riker?
			On the bridge.
			Where are you going?
			To the bridge.
			You're going to take that?
			Leave her here?
			Don't leave me here. Please don't
			leave me.
			Quite impossible.
			Sir, we are three minutes from
			resonator launch.
			Where is he?
			He'll be here.
			He has brought that child aboard
			my ship and onto my bridge.
			I'm sure Data will have a very
			good explanation.
			She was frightened and did not
			want to be left alone
			Mister Data, would you kindly
			assume your station.
			Counselor, escort her to Sickbay.
			It's all right, nobody's going
			to hurt you.
			We'll go and get a treat, and --
			NO!
			Captain, I will not allow her to
			be in the way.
			Two minutes to resonator launch.
			Little one, hush, it's all right.
			NO! Leave me alone! I want Data!
			Counselor, allow me. Please.
			Hush, it is all right now. No
			one will harm you. These are my
			friends.
			Take your station, Mister Data,
			and keep her with you. This does
			directly concern her.
			Thirty seconds to resonator
			launch.
			I require my hand now.
			Firing torpedoes.
			Sensors locked on probes.
			Torpedos have reached their
			targets...
			Resonators activated. Harmonic
			sequences have begun.
			What are you doing?
			We are attempting to quiet your
			planet. If we succeed, there will
			be no more quakes, no more
			volcanos.
			When should the results become
			evident?
			Very quickly, sir.
			And my parents and brothers?
			If our experiment...
			They will soon be safe.
			Captain, sensors indicate a
			planetwide reduction in tectonic
			stress levels.
			It's working. We did it!
			You did this for me?
			Sarjenka, look.
			Starboard view.
			There, there are your
			stars.
			What are you thinking?
			Someday, I'm going to be here.
			Data, take Sarjenka to Sickbay.
			Sir, must we?
			Yes.
			Data and the alien are on their
			way down. What would be involved
			in removing all memory of her
			communication with Data and her
			visit to this ship?
			Assuming her brain structure is
			similar to ours the memories will
			be stored chemically on the
			neurons of the cerebral cortex.
			They are also time dependent.
			I'll have to scan for age of the
			chemical links, and try to find
			the relevant neurons. To be sure
			I may have to go back weeks before
			the initial contact with Data.
			Well, do your best.
			You have many different kinds
			of people here.
			Yes.
			When I'm bigger can I be on your
			ship?
			I am certain you could.
			I wish I could come with you now.
			There are many things in life
			which we desire but will never
			receive. This is one of them.
			I know, but I can still wish for
			it.
			Sarjenka, this is Doctor Pulaski.
			Hello, dear.
			Hello.
			What is this?
			An Elanin Singer Stone. It sings
			a different song for each person.
			What does it sing for you?
			It does not sing for me.
			Why not?
			Because I am a machine.
			Oh Data, I'm sorry.
			Sarjenka, we're going to run a
			few scans just to make sure you're
			all right.
			Data's going to be right with you.
			Don't worry.
			You did a good thing, Data.
			But are we doing a good thing now?
			Data, this is to protect her as
			much as us.
			By robbing her of her memories?
			To remember you and this ship
			would complicate her future. She
			has to be the person she was born
			to be. And you'll remember.
			Sit down.
			No thank you sir. It's going to
			be a long time before I'm really
			qualified to sit here.
			You did a good job, Wes. I'm
			proud of you.
			Thank you, sir.
			Does it get any easier?
			No.
			Come.
			I came to thank you.
			No thanks are necessary. You
			reminded us that there are
			obligations beyond duty.
			You did not have to hold that
			conference. Your decision could
			have been unilateral.
			One of my officers...
			... One of my friends was in
			trouble. I had to help him.
			I am going to miss her, Captain.
			That too is part of friendship,
			remembrance and regrets.
			Yes, sir.
			And understanding that has taken
			you a step closer to humanity.
