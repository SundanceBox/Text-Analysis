			Medical log, Stardate 42437.5.
			Ira Graves is arguably the
			greatest human mind in the known
			universe...
			For years he's lived in near
			isolation on a remote planet,
			devoting full time to his
			revolutionary work...
			Eight hours ago, we monitored a
			message from his assistant,
			urgently requesting medical aid.
			It seems Graves' health is failing
			rapidly -- I only hope we can
			reach him in time...
			Any response from Gravesworld,
			Mister Worf?
			Nothing sir. Not since their
			initial communication.
			They send out a plea for help,
			then shut off the transmitters
			so they can't tell if help's on
			the way. Doesn't make much sense,
			does it?
			What's our e.t.a. at the planet,
			Mister Crusher?
			Thirty-six minutes to orbit, sir.
			You understand the importance of
			doing everything we can for Doctor
			Graves.
			Of course, Captain.
			Starfleet Command believes his
			work in quantum physics is
			reaching a critical stage. They
			consider this a priority one
			action.
			A man is ill, Captain. Treating
			him is my priority one.
			Regardless of who he is.
			It's wonderful. What is it?
			A year on the planet Thurasia is
			four hundred and ninety days long.
			It rains twice, and only twice.
			You're drinking Thurasian rain
			water.
			Water? Tastes more like...
			Heaven.
			Exactly. Where can I get some
			more of this?
			'Fraid that's the last of it.
			Next rainfall in a hundred and
			sixty three days.
			I'm not sure I can wait that long.
			Hey, old friend. Any luck?
			I believe my quest has ended in
			complete success.
			Data's been scouring the library,
			in search of the perfect joke.
			I have explored seventy-six
			thousand, two hundred and
			twenty-three anecdotes thus far.
			Why, Data?
			It is an attempt to find the most
			humorous anecdote in recorded
			history. And I believe I have
			done just that.
			This I gotta hear.
			There were twelve birds sitting
			on a fence... Six had a notion
			to fly away. How many were left?
			Okay, I'll bite. Six.
			No, twelve! They only had a
			notion to fly away!
			You did not find it wildly
			hilarious?
			What do you think?
			Perhaps I should have described
			the interesting plumage of --
			-- Data honey, I don't think it
			would've helped. That joke
			chilled my blood.
			Receiving a transmission from
			Gravesworld, sir. It's unfocused.
			Not directed specifically at us.
			On screen, Mister Worf.
			... If anyone can hear me, please
			send a doctor. Things are getting
			worse --
			Try and raise her, Mister Crusher.
			Tell them we're minutes away.
			It's no good, sir. I don't
			believe they're receiving us.
			Our records show that she and
			Graves are the only ones living
			on the planet, Captain.
			Then what scared her?
			Sir, I'm picking up another
			signal... but it's not from the
			planet.
			Confirmed. Point of origin...
			sector three-five mark seven.
			Signal is very weak, sir. Audio
			only.
			Pipe it through, Mister La Forge.
			... Mayday! Mayday! This is
			-- questing emergency assistance.
			Outer hull breached
			Environmental systems compro --
			Need immediate
			I show the Mary Rogers in that
			general vicinity, Captain. She's
			a transport ship, used to ferry
			settlers to new colonies. No
			other ships of any kind in this
			sector.
			Outer hull breached -- their air
			must be leaking out.
			There may be hundreds of colonists
			aboard that ship. We've got to
			help them!
			And what about Graves?
			He's one man. And we don't even
			know the nature of his illness.
			He's the man we came to assist!
			I have my orders, Doctor.
			Suggestion, sir.
			Suggest we execute long range
			transport of away team to assist
			Dr. Graves at earliest possible
			moment. We can use the mass of
			the planet to slingshot us toward
			the stricken liner, thus making
			up most of the lost time.
			Mister Crusher, make it so -- prepare
			for extended touch and go orbit.
			Aye sir.
			The transport may be a bit tricky.
			I'd like you to handle it, Mister
			La Forge.
			Understood, Captain.
			Assemble an away team, Number One.
			Include whatever medical
			assistants the Doctor deems
			necessary.
			Excuse me sir, but I'd be more
			useful dealing with the Mary
			Rogers. There may be hundreds
			who'll need attention --
			-- Thank you Doctor, but I'll make
			those decisions.
			You're going to Gravesworld.
			I cannot comprehend it. It is
			beyond my ability to reason.
			Don't feel too bad, Data. Humor
			is subjective.
			But this anecdote had all the
			elements humans find so diverting!
			A play on words, colorful
			characters, deception, a lively
			setting --
			-- Maybe it's the birds.
			Interesting. How so?
			Birds are considered to have
			boring personalities. They just
			sit around and eat seed all day.
			Maybe squawk once in a while.
			Boring.
			In fact, there's only one thing
			birds do that's funny, but you
			couldn't put that in a joke and
			keep it tasteful.
			Now chickens. Chickens are funny.
			Hello Guinan. Keeping this guy
			out of trouble?
			It's a challenge, but I'm trying.
			Excuse me sir, but in what way
			is Guinan attempting to restrain
			me from adversity?
			Never mind, Data, I was only
			joking.
			That joke was funny. Was it not?
			It wasn't meant to be, Data.
			Are you really going down to see
			Ira Graves? The Ira Graves?
			How did you know about that?
			Remember Will -- great men have
			great egos.
			Come on Data. A great man awaits.
			May I ask a question, sir?
			I think you just did.
			Quite correct. May I ask you
			another question after this one?
			Sure, what's on your mind?
			Do you think it is pointless for
			me to try and understand humor?
			Pointless? Not necessarily.
			I believe that comprehending what
			is truly funny will bring me
			closer to... humanness.
			Until recently, I thought I was
			making progress.
			For example Commander, do you find
			this amusing? There were
			twelve....... aquatic fowl sitting
			on a fence, and six had --
			-- Twelve. They only had a notion
			to fly away.
			How did you --
			-- Are you kidding? That joke's
			become a legend on this ship.
			Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We
			don't know what's going on down
			there; no need to take chances.
			Agreed, sir.
			Remember folks, this is a long
			range transport. The effects will
			be a little unusual.
			How do you mean?
			Understood. Energize.
			Wait a minute! I don't under --
			-- ssstttaaaaaannnnddd!
			You do now.
			Ohh... I know this is crazy, but
			for a moment I felt like I was
			trapped inside that wall.
			You were. For a moment.
			Riker to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			We've arrived in Graves' home.
			All's quiet so far -- on the other
			hand, no one knew we were coming.
			Use caution and investigate.
			Protect Graves' health at all
			cost. We're leaving orbit to
			assist the Mary Rogers. Back as
			soon as possible.
			Understood, Captain. Riker out.
			Let's look around -- see if
			anybody's home.
			Someone is home, sir.
			You heard me. Thank God.
			I'm Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves'
			assistant. Are you... you with
			Starfleet?
			Yes, we're from a ship called the
			Enterprise. We monitored your
			distress call but you never
			acknowledged our response.
			I'm sorry, I... couldn't take the
			chance...
			What chance?
			The chance that I might find out
			someone was coming.
			Kareen knew full well that I would
			not be pleased.
			I had no choice. I refuse to
			stand by and watch you
			deteriorate.
			What symptoms have you noticed?
			He has pain, shortness of breath,
			irritability --
			-- Ridiculous! I'm as healthy
			as a Rigellian ox!
			We'll see about that, Ira.
			I hope one of you is a doctor.
			Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Call
			me Kate.
			No offense, but I don't want you
			touching me in a medical way.
			It's no secret that I don't like
			people much, and I like doctors
			even less than people!
			Funny, I always thought doctors
			were people.
			And you were wrong. Just ask any
			patient.
			Although I will admit for a doctor
			you're a nice looking woman.
			And what have we here?... Another
			lovely specimen of womanhood.
			I thought you didn't like people?
			I like women. Always try to
			forget that they're people.
			I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honor
			to meet you Doctor Graves.
			Yes! Yes, of course it is! This
			is one of the truly great moments
			of your life! Believe me honey,
			you'll never meet anyone half as
			sagacious as me. I'm a phenom.
			Oh there I go again -- shocking
			people with the truth. I can
			appreciate how hard it is for
			others to try and keep up with
			my mind. I don't mean to burden
			with my brilliance. It just works
			out that way.
			Excuse me sir... Are you a
			Romulan?
			Hardly.
			He's a Klingon, Kareen.
			Kareen has lived here since her
			father died when she was quite
			young. Her only knowledge of
			inhuman races comes from me. I
			suppose Klingons and Romulans must
			look much alike.
			Do I have to stand here and be
			insulted?
			No insult intended, Mister Klingon.
			See Doctor? Nothing wrong with
			my hearing --
			My, my, my...
			Uh, Lieutenant Commander Data,
			sir --
			-- Shhh!
			Functional... Durable... Obviously
			no concern whatsoever for
			aesthetic values.
			Looks like Soong's work.
			Quite correct, sir! Did you know
			Soong?
			Know him?!
			I taught him everything he knows.
			You could say I was the father
			of his work...
			Which kinda makes me your
			grandfather, doesn't it sonny?
			Damn doctors! Always sneaking
			up on you like that -- saying this
			isn't going to hurt, this isn't
			going to hurt, when you both know
			it's going to hurt like hell!
			Well I'm not paying the bill for
			this!
			There won't be a bill, Doctor.
			May I speak with you privately?
			What for! Anything you think you
			found's more my business than his!
			Go on, gorgeous! Whatever the
			hell it is, I can take it.
			I checked twice to make certain...
			You have Varnay's disease.
			I'm sorry, Ira. You're dying,
			and there's nothing I can do about
			it.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42437.7.
			We've successfully transported
			the passengers and crew of the
			stricken liner Mary Rogers.
			Tragically, six people died in
			the initial explosion, but the
			rest are now aboard and in good
			condition. We are heading back
			to Gravesworld with great
			dispatch.
			You wanted to see me, sir.
			Yes Ensign. I assume you would
			very much like to meet Doctor
			Graves.
			Yes sir. His theories on spatial
			relationships are amazing! And
			his work in thermodynamics is --
			-- Good, I get the idea.
			Providing his health is reasonably
			intact, I'm going to appoint you
			as his personal tour guide when
			he comes aboard. You have the
			run of the ship -- show him
			anything you think he'll find
			interesting, and for heaven's
			sake, don't talk his ear off!
			Yes sir. Understood.
			But why me, sir? I mean, not that
			I'm complaining --
			-- Graves has a reputation for
			being difficult and I'm not sure
			I have the patience for that right
			now.
			And... sometimes the very old get
			along best with the very young.
			I'd say he has a week, but that's
			a guesstimate.
			Is he in great pain?
			Some. I could help with that but
			he won't let me get near him.
			He won't even let me get near him,
			now.
			Has he been... like a father to
			you?
			More like a teacher.
			I sense that his feelings for you
			are very warm. He's attracted
			to you in many ways.
			Attracted?... I know -- I've felt
			certain feelings from him. But
			he's always been a gentleman.
			Had I been older... perhaps we
			could've been lovers. But nothing
			like that ever happened between
			us.
			Now, it's like he's afraid to face
			me... The only one he talks to
			is your friend, Data.
			I have noticed Doctor, that you --
			-- Call me Grandpa. Seems more
			touching in my final hours.
			I have noticed Grandpa, that you
			keep repeating the same notes of
			a musical passage that I am
			unfamiliar with.
			It's an ancient little tune called
			"If I Only Had A Heart." A rather
			plaintive lament sung by a
			mechanical man who longs to be
			human. It's his only wish.
			What happens to this man?
			He finds out that he is human
			after all. Always was -- just
			worried so much he never realized
			it.
			A happy ending. The mechanical
			man got his wish.
			Stories often have happy endings.
			It's life that throws you for a
			loop.
			It must be hard for you... So
			close to being human and yet never
			really knowing what it's like to
			feel pain.
			But... pain is unpleasant... is
			it not?
			Pain... Lust... envy...
			pleasure... desire. Do you know
			what desire is, Data?
			Desire? It is to long for or
			crave, a wish, a request, a --
			-- Do you know what desire is?
			No... I do not suppose I will ever
			know what it really is.
			I feel pity for you. Your
			existence is a kind of walking
			purgatory -- neither dead nor
			alive, never really feeling
			anything. Just existing. Just
			existing.
			Listen to me -- a dying man taking
			the time to mourn a man who will
			never know death. Funny, isn't
			it?
			Funny?... I have... difficulty
			discerning what is funny.
			I've had the same difficulty most
			of my life. We're much alike.
			I just spoke with the captain.
			The Enterprise is minutes away;
			he'll contact us again when she
			goes into orbit.
			You informed him of Doctor Graves'
			condition?
			Yes. Arrangements are being made
			to make his last days with us as
			comfortable as possible.
			It'll be strange to leave here.
			You're a beautiful young woman,
			and there's a whole universe
			waiting for you out there.
			I'll be alone. I'll be without
			Ira.
			I know what it is to lose those
			closest to your heart. It will
			be hard... you will feel alone
			at first... but it will surely
			pass, as time passes. I know.
			You mentioned your impending death
			a while ago. I must say Grandpa,
			that you are facing it with
			remarkable courage and stoicism.
			That is because I am an incredible
			man, possessing an iron will and
			nerves of steel. Two traits that
			helped me become the genius I am
			today as well as the lady-killer
			I was in days gone by.
			You condone homicide, sir?
			It's an expression, Data. It
			means I was once as beautiful as
			I am smart.
			Really Grandpa?
			No, not really -- but what the
			hell, I'm dying. I can remember
			my life any way I want.
			And I'll tell you a little secret,
			Sonny. I don't think I truly will
			be dying.
			But... the doctor --
			-- Oh I'll die, but I won't really
			be dead. You see?
			I've invented a way of
			transferring consciousness into
			a computer. Before I die I plan
			to convey my great intelligence
			into this machine, thus cheating
			the Grim Reaper of his greatest
			prize.
			Grim Reaper... Is that a farmer
			with no sense of humor?
			I speak of the personification
			of death itself.
			But what do you know of death?
			It is a subject forever alien to
			you.
			Well Grandpa, that is not
			necessarily true. I do have an
			"off button" if you like. Its
			activation robs me of all
			consciousness -- therefore
			rendering me dead for all intents
			and purposes.
			It is not something I enjoy
			contemplating.
			I can understand that; still the
			analogy is a good one.
			Just where would Soong position
			such a device? Don't tell me,
			let me guess.
			Welcome to Gravesworld, sir. This
			is Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves'
			friend and assistant.
			I'm very sorry, Ms. Brianon. I'm
			sure this is quite difficult for
			you.
			Thank you, Captain. Your people
			have been most kind to me.
			Where's Data?
			He's been with Doctor Graves
			almost the entire time. They seem
			to have developed a genuine
			rapport.
			Hmm, I suppose I can understand
			that.
			I think we should immediately
			transport to the ship. There are
			patients from the Rogers who
			could use some of your medical
			savvy.
			Injuries?
			Nothing serious.
			But I'd also like to get Doctor
			Graves to a place where we can
			make him more comfortable.
			That will not be necessary,
			Captain.
			Explain yourself, Data.
			It happened in my arms, just a
			few moments ago.
			There is no need to hurry... Ira
			Graves is dead.
			Captain's log, Supplemental. I
			leave Gravesworld with an empty
			feeling and the knowledge that
			our mission was unsuccessful.
			Whatever scientific secrets Ira
			Graves was about to unlock will
			follow him to his grave...
			Our immediate priority is to reach
			the nearest starbase so that
			Graves' assistant and the marooned
			settlers can get on with their
			lives.
			And he really believed he could
			transfer his intellect into a
			computer?
			That is correct. Unfortunately
			he never had the opportunity to
			elaborate. Death came swiftly.
			Why didn't you notify Doctor
			Pulaski when it started to happen?
			To do so would have been
			pointless. There was nothing she
			could have done.
			It's probably right. My
			preliminary report indicates an
			extremely rapid heart stoppage.
			Death was almost instantaneous.
			I am not an "it," Doctor. You
			have been duly informed of this
			on several occasions, yet you
			continue to label me with that
			abhorrent pronoun.
			Data... I realize you liked Doctor
			Graves a great deal.
			He was the greatest man I have
			ever known.
			Does his death disturb you?
			Disturb, Captain? No. All things
			must pass.
			May I go now, sir?
			Yes of course.
			We will try and do the funeral
			the way he wanted, will we not,
			Captain?
			I told you we would, Data.
			I am glad, sir. It was his dying
			wish.
			That's interesting.
			Hmm?
			I thought he said death came
			swiftly. When did Graves have
			time to make a dying wish?
			Perhaps beforehand. Perhaps he
			had a premonition.
			Hello Data. It's good to see you
			again.
			The stars are so beautiful when
			seen from space. Yet they seem
			lonely -- each so isolated from
			the next.
			Ira... never told you how
			beautiful you were to him. He
			never told you that, did he?
			He could not tell you, do you
			understand?
			Yes. I understand.
			But he wanted to. Every waking
			moment.
			And he wanted you to know that.
			Data!
			How do you know? How do you
			know... what he thought of me?
			He told me.
			Captain Picard.
			What is it?
			I heard about the ceremony you're
			having for Doctor Graves, and...
			well sir --
			-- You wish to attend.
			Since I never got to meet him...
			I think it's a fine idea. Come
			along, Wes.
			... The temperature should be
			seventy-two, no make it
			seventy-one degrees. And whenever
			the name Ira Graves is mentioned
			it will warm considerably --
			Are we the first?
			You are the last. The others have
			congregated inside.
			Very good.
			Enter.
			Perhaps the child would be better
			off playing somewhere else. This
			is an adult ceremony after all.
			The child? You still working on
			your sense of humor, Data?
			You don't seem yourself lately.
			Are you feeling all right?
			Of course, sir. I am as healthy
			as a Rigellian ox.
			... Although we hardly knew him,
			we certainly knew of him. His
			reputation spread throughout the
			galaxy, and his mind touched all
			who cherish science.
			We gather here today, to say a
			respectful good-bye to Ira
			Ellsworth Graves. A man who --
			This is not exactly what he
			wanted.
			You programmed the setting. The
			field, the mountain range --
			-- It is not the environment that
			I question, Commander. This was
			one of his favorite places on
			Gravesworld.
			Well what is it then?
			It is the tone, the pacing, the
			content of the verbal tribute.
			No offense Counselor, but Doctor
			Graves would have desired a
			slightly more personal address.
			And how can you be so sure?
			Why he told me, of course.
			Perhaps I should take over, sir.
			If you promise to be brief. When
			I agreed to this, I didn't intend
			for it to interfere with our
			duties. Understood?
			Perfectly.
			Just look at that face. The face
			of a thinker, a warrior, a man
			for all seasons.
			Yes friends, Ira Graves was all
			that and more.
			Ira Graves was a great
			humanitarian.
			To know know know him, was to love
			love love him. But Ira Graves
			was not perfect.
			Data...
			Perhaps his greatest fault was
			that he was too selfless. Cared
			too much for his fellow man.
			Data! That's enough!
			I am almost finished sir.
			You are finished, you mean.
			What's become of your judgment?
			Perhaps I am maturing, sir.
			Do you consider it mature to
			program the mountains to tremble
			every time you say the name, Ira
			Graves?
			Not to mention the air warming
			at the very thought of him. We
			would've been barbequed if we'd
			stayed much longer.
			I seem to have overdone it.
			To put it mildly.
			I brought shame to this ship.
			To the good name of Starfleet.
			Data --
			-- I was only trying to carry out
			his wishes. To make sure I kept
			my promise.
			I know that Data.
			Look... I realize you've been
			studying the human equation with
			great alacrity, but maybe you've
			been trying just a little too
			hard. Do you know what I mean?
			Try and relax a little. Don't
			try to be so... "human." Just
			be yourself. Okay?
			Affirmative, sir. I will work
			on staying within myself. Now
			if you will excuse me, I am due
			on the bridge.
			I'm concerned, sir. I've never
			seen him act like this.
			Could it be that grandfather
			analogy Graves planted in his
			head?. Data is an orphan in a
			manner of speaking. Maybe the
			loss of Graves really got to him.
			Touched him emotionally.
			I hope that's all it is.
			It's Captain Picard and Commander
			Riker. May we come in?
			We've come to pay our respects,
			Miss Brianon.
			Thank you, gentlemen. That's most
			thoughtful.
			We're due at Starbase Six in less
			than twelve hours. We thought
			you might enjoy a quick look at
			the bridge before we arrive.
			Can one see the stars from up
			there?
			Oh yes. Closer than you've ever
			seen them before.
			I think I'd enjoy that very much.
			That was a great speech, Data.
			To know know him is to love love
			love love love him?!
			Taken from a centuries-old Earth
			composition. Your child-like mind
			cannot appreciate the timeworn
			wisdom of its words.
			You're not turning into a
			star-crossed artist on us, are
			you Data?
			I am many things: artist,
			scholar, lover, genius --
			You're getting funnier, I gotta
			hand it to you.
			There's something to be said for
			that deadpan delivery.
			You're looking in the general
			direction of the constellation
			Pegasus.
			I'm aware of your interest in
			science. Perhaps you'd like to
			--
			-- And I am aware of your interest
			in her.
			What was that, Data?
			Nothing sir. Nothing at all.
			These are our science stations.
			What's wrong with you?!
			I detest hypocrisy. I wish they
			would just come out and admit it.
			Admit what, Mister Data?
			That your interest in Kareen is
			not entirely honorable.
			Data! You are way out of line!
			Try as you might, you cannot win
			her heart. She does not like
			older men...
			... or men of limited intellect.
			Mister Data, you are hereby relieved
			of duty -- Worf, take his station.
			Yes sir.
			You will report to your quarters
			immediately. You will not leave
			there until you hear otherwise
			from me. Is that understood?
			Sure, I understand.
			I understand all too well.
			Removing the competition will not
			help you, Picard.
			Do you know what that was all
			about?
			Jealousy... I sensed intense,
			burning jealousy. And it was
			coming from Data!
			I heard what happened but I just
			can't believe it.
			Do not trouble yourself, friend.
			I am sure the captain will be by
			to apologize shortly.
			You expect him to apologize?
			It seems I was too harsh on Soong.
			Notice the strong chin, the finely
			chiseled features, the powerful
			torso. Do you realize that this
			body will never wear out.
			Immortality.
			What the hell are you talking
			about?
			He's not himself, sir. I know
			him better than anybody.
			We're going to Sickbay.
			Oh? Are you ill, sir?
			I'm getting there. Come along.
			I don't oil machinery.
			Why don't you take it down to
			Engineering?
			Because I brought him to you.
			I want a complete medical check
			run on him immediately.
			I'll do the best I can --
			-- I expect nothing less.
			-- But if it blew a fuse or
			something I may not pick it up.
			I have the utmost faith in your
			abilities, Doctor. I know nothing
			will get by you.
			I'm sure there's a reason you're
			looking at me that way.
			I am simply looking. Any thought
			of ulterior motive rests with you.
			Perhaps you are projecting your
			own desires.
			Perhaps not. I've had three
			husbands dear, and they've all
			been flesh and blood. For some
			strange reason I like it that way.
			Now shut up and turn over.
			Very well. It is your loss.
			Wait for me in the corridor, Mister
			Data.
			What for? This concerns me more
			than it does any of you.
			You will wait for me in the
			corridor!
			His insubordination is growing
			by leaps and bounds. I could
			throw him in the brig but I'd
			rather try and help him.
			Well I really don't know what to
			suggest. Physically it's fit as
			a fiddle. Granted it's not easy
			to examine a tin can the size of
			a human, but I'll be damned if
			I can find anything wrong with
			it.
			Perhaps we're looking in the wrong
			place, sir.
			Explain.
			Well, Data's physical health may
			be unimpaired but it's his mental
			health that needs to be addressed.
			Are you suggesting it's losing
			its mind?
			With your permission Captain,
			there's one way to find out.
			You remember the psychotronic
			stability examination, don't you
			Data? We all had to take it
			before graduating from the
			Academy.
			It was a waste of time then and
			it is a waste of time now.
			Just watch the screen and let your
			mind go blank. This little
			machine will do the rest.
			It's safe to say you're his best
			friend. Can you speculate on
			what's happening to him?
			It's just a guess sir, but, well
			sometimes he wants to be human
			so bad he can taste it. And
			sometimes he is more human than
			he or we realize.
			Yes...
			I think your theory might be
			right, Captain. Witnessing
			Graves' death may have been the
			catalyst --
			I have the results of the tests,
			Captain. I -- I ran two tests
			to make certain.
			Make certain of what?
			There are two distinct
			personalities within Lieutenant
			Commander Data.
			What?! He's an android, that's
			not possible!
			Nevertheless it is true. The
			second personality is the
			dominant. It is unbalanced:
			brilliant but vain, sensitive yet
			paranoid. I believe it is also
			capable of extreme acts of
			violence.
			So that's it...
			What was that, sir?
			Nothing. Go on.
			It seems to have an especially
			strong hatred of you, Captain.
			Or to a lesser degree, any
			authority figure.
			And worst of all, it's growing.
			How do you mean?
			The alien persona is getting
			stronger -- gobbling up what's
			left of the original Data.
			If we don't find a way to stop
			it immediately, the Data we knew
			will be gone forever.
			Where is he now, Counselor?
			I left him in his quarters. He
			still has orders not to leave.
			Orders? Which personality will
			choose to obey my orders?
			Tell me -- where is Lieutenant
			Commander Data?
			Hello Kareen.
			You know who I am, don't you?
			You're -- you're Data.
			You know who I am. Don't you.
			Ira?...
			It is me, Kareen! I'm here -- I'm
			alive!
			How?
			The process worked! I turned Data
			off and transferred my
			consciousness into his frame.
			Just look at me! Sleek, powerful,
			indestructable.
			When I was a boy, other children
			knew I couldn't match them
			physically. They teased me -- bullied
			me. That's when I
			withdrew... Became an island.
			But no one will ever bully me
			again.
			If they try, I'll simply break
			their necks.
			Don't talk that way, Ira. I've
			never known you to be violent.
			I've never been capable of
			violence. But now I'm more than
			capable -- and I rather enjoy this
			new ability.
			Excuse me Data, but the captain
			would like to see you.
			Of course.
			If you will excuse me, Miss
			Brianon.
			You're just the type, aren't you?
			You'd beat me up if you could,
			but you can't. Not any more.
			Ira, no.
			Stay out of it!
			You're lucky I'm such a
			compassionate man. Now walk!
			There's something I must do -- something
			they're forcing me to
			do. I'll come for you when my
			task is complete.
			Ira... I don't understand...
			what's happening to you?
			Something wonderful. I feel no
			pain, no pain at all! And I'm
			immortal -- I'll never have to
			face death again. Think of the
			things I'll accomplish over the
			next thousand years!
			I know what you're thinking, but
			there's no need to worry. I'll
			create an android body for you
			as well. We'll witness the end
			of infinity together.
			Don't cry, Kareen.
			Don't you see, I can love you now.
			The way I've always wanted to.
			It wouldn't have been right
			then... I was too old for you,
			too weak. But now I can be
			everything you've ever wanted.
			Ira -- you're hurting me!
			I'll be back. Wait for me.
			Ohhh, what hit me?
			Did Data do this?
			But it's not really Data.
			Yes. I realize that now.
			Security alert -- all decks.
			Lieutenant Commander Data may be armed and
			dangerous. Use extreme caution
			and subdue. All phasers on stun.
			Well hello there. You all look
			like you could use a little
			vacation.
			Captain Picard -- I have ordered
			your people to vacate the bridge
			and they have refused. In an
			effort to save insignificant lives
			I will give you the opportunity
			to issue the same order.
			Otherwise, I will remove them my
			way.
			That phaser's set to kill,
			Captain.
			Data. That's your best friend
			you're threatening. That's
			Geordi. You wouldn't harm him
			for the world, would you?
			Geordi?
			Yes Data. It's me.
			He's no friend of mine! I should
			kill him on the spot -- put him
			out of his blind misery.
			You win -- no need to act rashly.
			Mister La Forge, you and the rest
			of the bridge crew will vacate
			immediately.
			I'll blast anyone who attempts
			to reenter.
			You will make no attempt to
			recapture the bridge. Is that
			clear, Geordi?
			Yes sir. Evacuating now.
			Maybe I should shoot one in the
			back just to let you know I mean
			business.
			What is it you want? Tell me!
			Kareen is with us! You want to
			talk to Kareen.
			Kareen? Are you there?
			Yes -- yes Ira. I'm here.
			They're all against me, Kareen.
			They want to drive me out of this
			body. To kill me!
			We're going to a new world, my
			darling. A place where no one
			can ever touch us. Just hang on,
			and trust in me.
			Riker to bridge, Riker to bridge.
			It's no good. He deactivated the
			monitor.
			We must remember that we're
			dealing with an unhealthy mind,
			ravaged by Varnay's disease as
			well as the strain of assimilating
			into a new body.
			And that "unhealthy mind" is in
			total control of this ship.
			Yet he seems to have a purpose.
			He said something about going to
			a new world.
			Do you know what he meant by that?
			Is there anything you can tell
			us about Ira Graves that will help
			us to understand?
			He's a wonderful man. He's not
			like this --
			-- He's taken over my ship! And
			I want her back!
			Are you going to help me?
			How can I help?
			By rejecting him! By deflating
			his ego.
			Yes, he said he was doing this
			for you. Saying you want nothing
			to do with him might distract him
			long enough --
			-- I won't hurt him! He's sick,
			I won't help to destroy him.
			It might be our only hope! He
			controls all life-support systems
			on this ship. He could start
			killing us like flies.
			I can't do it, don't you
			understand?
			Yes, I suppose I do understand.
			Where are you going, Captain?
			To the bridge.
			I can't let you do that, sir.
			You have no choice, Number One.
			Should I fail to return I want
			you to attempt an external bridge
			separation. Get all of our people
			as far away from him as possible.
			You can't just walk in on him!
			He won't hesitate to kill you.
			There's still some of Data inside.
			I know there is. If I can reach
			him, maybe we've still got a
			chance.
			I could've killed you. You know
			that, don't you?
			I do know that. I also know you
			haven't killed anyone so far.
			I don't think you really want to.
			Where are we going?
			To the Aldebaran system. There's
			a planet there that suits my
			purpose.
			Which is?
			Why should I tell you?
			Because you're lonely. Because
			you want someone else to share
			your plans.
			I'll tell you... because I'm
			bored. I plan on building a
			fortress, with a laboratory of
			course. Those of your crew that
			I do not exterminate shall live
			there as our slaves. Kareen will
			never want for anything.
			And what of Data? Your
			"grandson."
			What of him?
			You took advantage of him.
			I did him a favor! I gave him
			life!
			You killed him! You're nothing
			but a two-bit murderer!
			You call me a murderer?! I'll
			show you what murder is.
			Stop it!
			You've become a monster.
			Don't say that, Kareen. He
			attacked me --
			-- And a liar as well.
			I hate you. I despise you.
			Kareen... don't...
			You're not a man anymore! You're
			a pathetic little pile of
			machinery!
			Stop... please...
			The thought of ever living with
			something like you makes me sick.
			I'd rather live alone! I'd rather
			make love to a computer!
			Are you going to kill me too?
			You hate me... What can I do, what
			can I do?
			Leave that body. It doesn't
			belong to you.
			Data! Data, can you hear me?
			May I ask you a question,
			Commander?
			I think you just did.
			Quite correct. May I ask you
			another question after this one?
			No questions. Just tell me a
			joke. The funniest joke in
			history.
			All right. There were twelve...
			starship captains, sitting on a
			fence --
			-- I've heard more than enough
			to know you're you again.
			He's in there. Ira put himself
			in the computer.
			No Kareen. The real Ira Graves
			never left the planet.
