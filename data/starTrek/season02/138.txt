			Ship's log, stardate 42625.4,
			First Officer Riker reporting.
			We have achieved orbit around
			Theta Eight...
			... the planet furthest from its
			sun in this previously unmapped
			solar system. It is a world of
			ruthless realities: particularly
			harsh, barren, and inhospitable...
			Our reason for being here -- a
			passing Klingon cruiser reported
			discovering pieces of a strange
			vessel in the upper atmosphere.
			We've come to investigate...
			Nasty. Nitrogen... methane...
			liquid neon. Surface temperature
			minus two hundred and ninety-one
			degrees Fahrenheit. Winds up to
			three hundred and twelve meters
			per second.
			Not exactly a vacation planet,
			eh?
			Uh uh. Not unless you like
			ammonia tornadoes. Or orange
			lightning bolts for that matter.
			Not my cup of tea. Found anything
			artificial in the atmosphere?
			Nothing so far. We're just coming
			around to the night side now.
			Keep me informed. The sooner we
			identify what the Klingons think
			they saw, the sooner we can get
			the hell out of here.
			Sounds good to me.
			Nasty.
			Come.
			Fermat's last theorem. Familiar
			with it?
			No. I'm afraid I spent too many
			math classes daydreaming about
			being on a starship.
			It's intriguing. When Fermat died
			they found scrawled in the margin
			of his notes that he had found
			a "remarkable proof."
			Unfortunately he never lived to
			write it down. And for the last
			eight hundred years people have
			been trying to rediscover it.
			And that includes you?
			I find the process relaxing.
			We've detected debris of some sort
			in a loose orbit.
			Can you identify?
			I suggest we beam a section aboard
			for analysis.
			Make it so, Number One.
			Energize.
			We've locked onto something with
			markings on it.
			What sort of markings?
			Uncertain, sir.
			There's something here.
			That symbol... Do you recognize
			it?
			Yes sir. I -- I think I do.
			Metallic analysis bears out that
			the object in question was
			terrestrial in origin. Most
			likely late twenty-first century.
			But that's not possible. No ship
			of that time period could have
			come this far.
			Nevertheless, that is what our
			tests indicate. And the markings
			we discovered are consistent with
			this hypothesis.
			Any idea what destroyed it? An
			explosion of some sort?
			Unknown.
			The question is, how did it get
			here?
			Captain. We've detected a large
			structure on the planet.
			It is a building of some sort,
			situated on a plane of frozen
			methane, smack in the middle of
			a tremendous storm belt. It is
			incongruous; it simply should not
			be there!
			Are you certain it's artificially
			constructed?
			Absolutely. The structure is
			surrounded by breathable air.
			It's hard to accept...
			Yet it does seem to be down there.
			Is there a connection between the
			structure and the ship?
			Suggestions?
			Only one, sir. Suggest we go down
			and have a look.
			Form an away team, minimal
			complement.
			Let's see if we can find the
			architects.
			Give me a moment, gents. We're
			dealing with an extremely narrow
			access point.
			We're ready when you are...
			Phasers on stun.
			Energize.
			Where are we?
			Exactly where Geordi said we would
			be. The structure is directly
			behind us.
			I am detecting vast ammonia storms
			raging mere kilometers away. Yet
			they do not appear to penetrate
			this breathable zone.
			It's like the eye of a hurricane.
			It is here. It must be here, yet
			we cannot see it.
			Enterprise, this is Commander
			Riker. We have arrived in a very
			unusual place... it is like being
			in the eye of a hurricane. It
			is completely calm, no sound, no
			movement, yet a few meters away
			a storm, which we can neither see
			nor hear, is raging.
			Describe the structure.
			We can't see it.
			Commander, over here. I see
			something!
			What is this thing?
			What is it, Commander?
			I think it's a door. An antique.
			Judging by its location, it may
			be an entrance to the structure
			we seek.
			Well... this is what we came here
			for.
			Captain, we are entering the
			structure.
			Riker to Enterprise. We have
			entered the structure.
			We're not getting through.
			Where's that interference
			originating?
			From the source, sir. Cause...
			unknown.
			Lock onto the landing party.
			Have the Transporter Room prepare
			to beam them up.
			We can't distinguish them as long
			as they're inside that structure.
			Can they hear us?
			We've got to recalibrate all
			frequencies.
			Make it so.
			Without radio contact, we should
			leave immediately.
			Agreed. We'll make a preliminary
			sweep of this environment and then
			return.
			Checking in, gentlemen? You'll
			have to go to the front desk.
			Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice
			trip?
			Uh... Do you know us?
			We've been expecting you. A trio
			of foreign gentlemen.
			We're from the United Federation
			of Planets --
			Of course. Welcome to The Hotel
			Royale...
			Did Rita call?
			No -- and for your own good you
			had better quit thinking about
			Rita.
			I'm not afraid of him.
			Then you're a fool. Everybody
			with any sense is afraid of Mikey
			D.
			If Rita calls -- you let me know.
			The kid's just askin' for trouble
			-- Rita's too much for him to
			handle, and Mikey D will plant
			his face in the pavement.
			Now, here are your room keys and
			some complimentary casino chips.
			Enjoy!
			What is this place? How did a
			being like you get here?
			Why this is the Royale, of
			course. And my personal life is
			really none of your business,
			thank you.
			What he means is, what planet
			is this?
			I beg your pardon?
			This planet. What do you call
			it?
			Earth.
			What do you call it?
			We call it Theta Eight.
			How charming.
			Commander...
			Yes Data?
			None of these people... are
			emitting life signs.
			You mean they're not alive?
			Then what are they?...
			These beings... are they machines,
			or mere illusions, designed to
			deceive us?
			Not illusions, Lieutenant. They
			do exist, but they do not register
			as either man or machine.
			For example, this creature
			exhibits no DNA structure.
			Look who's talkin'.
			He sounds just like my ex-wife.
			Aaaaall right!! Time to get back
			to business!
			What sort of business do you
			suppose he is getting down to?
			Status report?
			We're attempting to employ
			alternate encoding schemes.
			There are hundreds of possible
			combinations, Captain.
			Is there an intelligence causing
			the interference?
			Impossible to tell, Captain.
			You're new around here, aren't
			you?
			Yes. I have certainly never
			visited this place, or its true
			counterpart, before.
			Sit down, boy. I'll show you how
			this game is played.
			Go ahead. Ante up.
			It seems he expects something of
			me.
			He wants you to cut the cards.
			Ah, is this poker?
			No, it's blackjack.
			Also known as twenty-one, a
			number which defines the object
			of the game. Tens and picture
			cards are worth ten, ace -- one
			or eleven -- the other cards face
			value. The dealer must hit
			seventeen -- five cards under pays
			double.
			Not at this joint -
			Run 'em, boy. And make 'em
			friendly. There's no bread in
			the house.
			Aren't you going to look at your
			hand?
			Poor girl needs to win.
			Fifteen - do I hit, Texas, or
			stand?
			If you've got to win -- then you've
			got to hit.
			Hit me.
			Damn!
			Hit me.
			Twenty-one -- a winner.
			Having fun, Data?
			Fun, sir? While there is a
			certain amount of enjoyment
			involved I was mainly conducting
			research into --
			-- Save it, Data. We're getting
			out of here.
			Understood, sir.
			Hey, you're holding up the game.
			Our apologies. Come on, Data.
			Try it again.
			Sir, there is no other exit point.
			Unless we can find another way...
			it seems we are trapped here.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			remain in orbit around Theta
			Eight, still out of contact with
			the away team.
			Phasers are totally ineffective
			on all surfaces.
			I am checking options... they
			seem quite limited --
			We don't have any. If we're ever
			going to get out of here, we'll
			have to do it on our own.
			I'm going to get some answers out
			of that desk clerk...
			Are you crazy?
			Wrong. I'm finally getting some
			smarts --
			You think you're gonna scare Mikey
			D with that thing?
			I'm gonna make him leave Rita
			alone.
			Kid, she's a big girl... and she's
			Mikey D's girl.
			Not any more. Not after tonight.
			Look. I like you. I don't want
			to see you get hurt... especially
			over some dame --
			Don't call her that!
			You'll see! You'll see how tough
			Mikey D is! He's nothin'!
			I want some answers!
			The concierge can help you with
			any --
			We want out of here. Now.
			I'm afraid you've missed your
			check-out time. We do have our
			rules, you know.
			I mean out of the building. We
			want to get outside --
			The Royale's exits are clearly
			marked.
			That's not good enough.
			If you have a complaint about the
			service you've received during
			your stay, you can always take
			it up with the manager.
			Fine! I'd like to see him
			immediately!
			I'm afraid the manager is very
			busy.
			... Riker, can you read me?
			Yes, go ahead.
			Enterprise?... Enterprise?...
			... Enterprise...
			Why haven't you left the
			building, Number One?
			... Tried... Trapped here... No
			immediate danger...
			Something at your location is
			interfering with our exchange...
			Working on the problem...
			These frequencies aren't
			working.
			Then find another.
			Yes sir.
			What is going on down there?
			Commander... I am picking up
			something most unusual in another
			section of this structure.
			Indications of DNA.
			Where?
			Thirty-one point nine meters
			above and to the right of us.
			Perhaps those turbolifts could
			take us there.
			The reading I got is behind this
			door.
			My reading is intensifying.
			Life signs?
			None.
			Definitely human. Male.
			Looks like the poor devil died
			in its sleep.
			What a terrible way to go.
			He has been dead for two hundred
			eighty-three years. The lack of
			any advanced decomposition is
			attributable to the sterile
			environment.
			Commander, look here.
			Is that... this "Las Vegas" you
			spoke about?
			I believe that's what the
			illusion is meant to be.
			Why would anyone go to all this
			trouble? It's all just... window
			dressing for a dead man.
			Is this significant, sir?
			American. Fifty-two stars -- that
			would date it between 2053 and
			2079 A.D.
			Colonel S. Richey.
			Rest in peace, Colonel.
			Picard to Riker.
			Finally.
			Riker. Go ahead.
			What's your situation?
			We are locked in a structure made
			to resemble twentieth century
			Earth -- all efforts to exit have
			failed.
			We can't transport.
			I assumed as much. Captain, we
			have located the remains of a
			human.
			Request identity scan on a
			Colonel Richey, American, first
			initial S., roughly same time
			period.
			We also need a computer library
			check on hotel known as the
			Royale; possible location, Las
			Vegas, Nevada, circa twenty-first
			century.
			Get on it.
			Information retrieved, Captain --
			Colonel Stephen Richey was the
			commanding officer of the
			explorer ship Charybdis which
			had a terrestrial launch date of
			7-23-2067. It was the first
			manned attempt to travel beyond
			the confines of the Euclidian
			solar system. Its telemetry
			system failed and it was never
			heard from again...
			Why is this of interest, Number
			One?
			The frequency scramble remains
			unpredictable, sir...
			Commander? Some curiosities...
			Books... A novel...
			"The Royale Hotel"...
			Summarize.
			The story of a group of compulsive
			gamblers caught up in the web of
			crime, corruption and deceit spun
			by nefarious lothario Mikey D who
			appears only at the climax to be
			brought to his knees by a
			heartbroken bellboy. There is
			a subplot about an older man
			conspiring with a younger woman
			to murder her husband while
			squandering her inheritance. The
			writing is elementary, the
			plotting predictable, the
			characters one-dimensional. The
			only thing of interest, quite
			honestly, is the intriguing
			setting, that of a Las Vegas
			gambling casino-hotel --
			This novel... and everyone in
			it you've just described...
			that's this hotel...
			This... this appears to be a
			diary... but with only one
			entry...
			"I write this in the hope that
			it will someday be read by human
			eyes... I can only surmise at this
			point, but apparently our
			exploratory shuttle was
			contaminated by an alien life-form
			which infected and killed all
			personnel except myself. I
			awakened to find myself here in
			The Royale Hotel... and for the
			last thirty-eight years I have
			survived here.
			"I have come to understand that
			this place was created for me
			out of some sense of guilt,
			presuming that the novel we had
			on board was in fact a guide to
			our preferred lifestyle and social
			habits. Obviously, they thought
			this was the world from which I
			came. I hold no malice toward
			my benefactors... they could not
			possibly know the hell they have
			put me through, for it was such
			a badly written book, filled with
			endless cliche and shallow
			characters. I shall welcome death
			when it comes... "
			Then that is why... all of this
			is here. But why can't we get
			out?
			Suppose we phaser a slice in the
			field which surrounds the
			structure?
			Yes...
			That would mean the atmosphere
			of the planet would instantly rush
			in.
			How long would they live under
			those conditions?
			A minute -- maybe less.
			But you could revive them.
			Well, that would depend on how
			long they were exposed, how soon
			I got to them, but Captain
			realistically... I wouldn't give
			them much of a chance. I'm a
			doctor -- not a magician.
			I understand the risk, but I will
			not warp off and leave them.
			Make your preparations.
			Yes, sir.
			Yes?
			There is a female voice asking
			if we want... "room service."
			I believe they are asking if we
			want the room cleaned.
			Tell them no.
			No.
			What'd she say?
			She said... "The kitchen's open
			twenty-four hours if we change
			our minds."
			I'm going to explore the other
			floors; you two go down to the
			lobby, see if we've missed
			anything. Talk to the other
			"guests" -- try and find out who
			and what they are.
			I suggest we separate and blend
			in with these beings. Casual
			queries offered in an
			inconspicuous manner might prove
			most fruitful.
			What?
			Mingle, Worf. Mingle.
			How much do I have left?
			Honey, it's bad luck to count your
			chips at the table...
			If I might inquire, where are you
			from, sir?
			Lubbock, Texas.
			How did you get here?
			To Vegas? Drove. Got a
			ninety-six caddy with only eighty
			thousand miles on her.
			And where is your automobile now?
			Hit?
			It's out front, I suppose. What
			the hell difference does it make?
			Could you take me there?
			I'm losing my shirt here --
			Now son, why would I wanna do
			that? Can't you see I'm tryin'
			to to help this little lady?
			I do not believe you could go to
			your car, even if it truly exists.
			You are trapped inside the Royale,
			just as I am.
			Sure does feel that way when
			you're losin', doesn't it? But
			right now we're tryin' to turn
			this lady's wagon and win back
			some lost change. Otherwise she's
			goin' to be in a desperate
			situation with nowhere to turn.
			Well, almost nowhere.
			I stay, right?
			I wouldn't.
			The odds favor standing pat.
			What do I do?
			You want a card or what?
			Too many.
			That's everything I had. I've
			lost it all. What am I going to
			do?
			There, there...
			You were told.
			It's not for you to make the
			call... it's for Rita.
			She sent me to tell you.
			Boys -- we can't afford to have
			any trouble here -- take it
			outside.
			Yeah -- I like that... come on,
			baggage man... let's you and me
			take it outside.
			Watch yourself.
			Don't worry.
			It's all part of the novel. Don't
			interfere.
			You should have listened, kid
			no woman is worth dying for...
			killing for... but not dying for.
			How can he leave?
			It is on page 244.
			The book... Then... how does it
			end?
			A bad love affair ends in a bloody
			shoot-out, the hotel gets bought
			out and life goes on... such as
			it is --
			The hotel gets bought? By whom?
			It is not very specific. The
			acquiring party is simply referred
			to as "foreign investors." Sale
			price, twelve point five million.
			That's how we're getting out.
			We're buying this place.
			Number One... If we don't take
			some action, make some attempt -- however
			dangerous it may be -- to
			rescue you, you may very
			well be lost to the confines of
			that conundrum for all eternity.
			That is certain death for you
			all... and that...
			... that is unacceptable! We
			have set phaser focus with energy
			ratios sufficient to penetrate
			the structure --
			Hold on that. There may be
			another way. I'll keep you
			informed.
			It is a question of decimal
			percentages. Quite simple, really
			if one bets with any sequential
			consistency.
			Can you do it?
			Certainly.
			C'mon, sugar, seven-come-eleven
			and we're on easy street --
			Snake eyes.
			I'm almost broke!
			Baby, relax! It's only money --
			But if I lose it all, I won't
			even have a place to sleep.
			Don't worry your pretty little
			head. I'd never let that happen.
			It's your roll, sir...
			Go to work.
			Maybe this turkey'll change our
			luck --
			Six. The point is six --
			Six! Hell, my blind grandmother
			can make a six! Let 'er rip, boy!
			Seven. Seven and out...
			So much for your new turkey --
			These cubes are improperly
			balanced. I believe that their
			final resting position is
			adversely affected --
			Loaded dice.
			Can you... "repair" them?
			I believe so...
			Seven! A winner!
			Attaboy! Just do that a few more
			times and everybody's gonna get
			well --
			Who has the dice?
			Oh, Tex, darlin', you're
			brilliant!
			Yeah. An' good lookin' too, huh?
			Isn't that enough?
			Almost. I don't want to be short,
			that's for sure...
			You are keeping count?
			Eleven point three million.
			Perhaps I will bet it all --
			No! Simply reach twelve million.
			As you wish...
			The man has the touch.
			Now.
			I would like to cash out, please.
			I'm afraid you've broken the bank.
			That's over twelve million --
			Twelve point five million to be
			exact. The purchase price of
			this hotel.
			That's impossible --
			Wrong. We're the "foreign
			Investors" on page 244. We're
			buying you out, lock, stock, and
			barrel.
			Consider it a "done deal."
			Hey, y'know what? Y'all got
			style! I like that! Let me buy
			y'all a drink --
			Enjoy the game, friend. And don't
			let 'em change the dice on you.
			Wait! You can't leave!
			Oh yeah? Watch us.
			Don't forget, we own the joint.
			You're confident about this,
			Commander?
			Focus. Concentrate. See only
			where we want to BE, not where
			we are.
			Ancient philosophical overtones
			of thought process... "Zen", I
			believe --
			We own the place... and we're
			walking through that door...
			I think it's time to go home...
			Transporter Room, we have a fix
			on our away team. Beam them up...
			and please be quick about it!
