			Captain's log, Stardate 42923.7.
			We are en route to the Braslota
			System, site of the first
			Starfleet battle simulation.
			Joining the Enterprise as observer
			and mediator is the Zakdorn Master
			Strategist, Sirna Kolrami.
			Despite misgivings, I have agreed
			to Starfleet's request that we
			take part in these wargame
			exercises.
			Mister Kolrami -- Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard. Welcome aboard.
			Captain. I bring greetings from
			those at Starfleet Command.
			Would you care to be shown to your
			quarters?
			I require little rest, Captain.
			I would prefer to commence our
			mission.
			Despite their reputations, this
			Zakdorn does not appear to be a
			very formidable warrior.
			In the game of military
			brinksmanship, individual
			physical prowess is less
			important than the perception of
			a species as a whole. For over
			nine millennia potential foes have
			regarded the Zakdorns as having
			the greatest innately strategic
			minds in the galaxy.
			And no one is willing to test that
			perception in combat.
			Exactly.
			Then the reputation means nothing.
			The Braslota System. In orbit
			around the second planet is the
			eighty-year old Starcruiser,
			Hathaway.
			He is still your choice?
			Commander Riker will captain the
			Hathaway.
			You will have forty-eight hours
			to ready the vessel before the
			Enterprise attacks.
			And we'll be experiencing actual
			battle conditions?
			Correct. Engineering will
			disconnect the Enterprise's
			weapons and link the system with
			the modified laser-pulse beam.
			All "hits" will be recorded
			electronically. If the computer
			registers "damage," it will react
			accordingly -- shutting down the
			affected areas for the appropriate
			"repair" time. Additional
			questions?
			Captain Picard, I understand that
			you initially resisted Starfleet's
			request for this simulation.
			Yes.
			May I know why?
			Starfleet is not a military
			organization. Our purpose is
			exploration.
			Then why am I here?
			Because with the Borg threat,
			I have decided that my officers
			and I need to hone our tactical
			skills.
			In a crisis situation, it is
			prudent to have several options.
			I still prefer brains over brawn.
			I think it's a waste of
			effort to test our combat skills
			-- it's a minor province in the
			make-up of a starship captain.
			Your objection is noted. Let us
			hope your distaste for the
			exercise will not affect your
			strategic abilities.
			Mister Kolrami, when I agree to
			do a thing. I do it.
			Care to surrender now, Captain?
			Well, Number One, you are allowed
			a complement of forty. Select
			whom you will. Save Data, who
			will serve as my first officer
			in your absence.
			I had envisioned you defining the
			crew.
			On my ship, the leader of an away
			team has total control of the
			mission. If you want to judge
			"leadership" -- why not start at
			the beginning?
			Very well, Captain.
			My, what a charmer.
			Now, Doctor...
			Captain, he needs an attitude
			adjustment.
			The Zakdornian culture is replete
			with self-assuredness and
			confidence. It is seldom
			undeserved. For example, Kolrami
			is a third level grand master at
			the game of Strategema.
			Another millimeter... little
			more... there! Excellent.
			Lieutenant.
			Commander.
			You've heard of the simulation
			aboard the Hathaway?
			Yes, sir, and the best of luck
			to you. I've researched the old
			Avidyne engines -- archaic by our
			standards, very touchy.
			Anticipating the worst, do you
			think it can be whipped into shape
			in forty-eight hours?
			I've taken the liberty of packing
			a few necessities.
			Enter!
			Am I disturbing you?
			Just finishing, Commander.
			"Interesting" quarters.
			Thank you.
			You know of the simulation. What
			do you think?
			Waste of time.
			It's just designed to be an
			exercise.
			Useless. If there is nothing to
			lose -- no sacrifice -- then there
			is nothing to gain.
			You mean -- besides "pride."
			Well, it's a good thing in this
			case, because I probably don't
			have a chance.
			There is always a chance.
			Slim. The Hathaway's most
			sophisticated weapon-systems --
			even in a computer mock-up --
			can't hope to defeat the
			Enterprise.
			Still...
			Worf... when you're out-gunned,
			out-manned, and out-equipped --
			what else do you have left?
			Guile.
			Join me.
			The honor is to serve.
			Begin long-range scanning of all
			sectors within three light years
			of Braslota.
			How is your crew shaping up?
			It's complete, but I would like
			to request an addition.
			Anyone in mind?
			With your permission, I would like
			Acting Ensign Crusher aboard for
			educational observation.
			Oh... since we have some time
			before reaching Braslota --
			I was hoping that you would agree
			to play me in a game of Strategema.
			Although I am intrigued by the
			audacity of your request, I can't
			fathom why you wish the encounter.
			I enjoy a challenge.
			Very well, an opponent of "limited
			dimensions" can often be quite
			diverting.
			Thank you.
			So you're going to beat him?
			Nope.
			Oh, then it's going to be a close
			one.
			No.
			But you have got a chance?
			Nah.
			Are you planning to show up?
			Sure, Kolrami is the best at
			Strategema. To even get to play
			him is a privilege.
			Other than you being privileged,
			is there anything else I can
			look forward to?
			Nope.
			This is going to be exciting.
			Against an opponent of approximate
			skill -- Strategema can last well
			over one thousand moves.
			I wouldn't bet on us being here
			that long.
			I have wagered heavily in the
			ship's pool that you will take
			him past the sixth plateau.
			What if I don't?
			I will be... irritated.
			Forever curious, this urge to
			"compete."
			It's a human response, that inborn
			craving to gauge your capabilities
			through conflict.
			Doctor, there are other ways to
			challenge oneself.
			Perhaps... but they all lack a
			certain -- thrill!
			Data, sometimes humans find it
			helpful to have an outsider set
			the standard by which they're
			judged.
			To avoid deceiving oneself.
			Maybe you should challenge
			Kolrami to Strategema.
			Why?
			Because when someone is that smug,
			you occasionally have to deflate
			them just a little.
			Yeah, Data, I'd like to see your
			neural-flecks tear him down a peg.
			To what end?
			Computer -- actuation positions
			for Strategema.
			Ready?
			Begin!
			That's it?
			I'm afraid so.
			But... but you only made
			twenty-three moves.
			Yes.
			Congratulations.
			Commander Riker --
			There is your next challenge.
			Away team assembled and ready to
			transport, Commander.
			Until we test our mettle on the
			field of honor.
			I may get over there and want to
			come right home.
			Good luck, Number One... Captain.
			The simulation will commence in
			forty-eight hours.
			Not good.
			Oh, Mister Worf, you're wrong.
			It's fantastic... and it's ours
			--
			Mister Worf.
			Sir, Lieutenant La Forge is a
			superior officer. The honor
			should be his.
			Worf, this is a battle simulation,
			and you're our tactical officer.
			Mister La Forge and I agreed, you
			need to be at my side.
			And if the engine room is anything
			like the bridge, I'm going to have
			my hands full.
			Attention crew of the USS
			Hathaway -- this is your captain.
			I can promise you that two days
			from now we will have missed a
			lot of sleep. But with your skill
			and your stamina, we'll have this
			old lady ready to fly.
			I want hourly progress reports
			from every station. Riker out.
			It's a real mess down here, but
			we'll get to work on it.
			I'm sure you'll perform your
			usual miracle.
			Nice work, Geordi, now what's
			the possibility for warp drive?
			There are only minute dilithium
			fragments left in the holding
			clamps. And even if we had intact
			crystals, there's no anti-matter
			to fuel the drive.
			Any recommendations?
			No, sir.
			We don't have a prayer.
			Would you care to transfer back to
			the Enterprise, Mister Crusher?
			No, Sir!
			Remember Wes, the purpose here
			is to improvise. It's the effort
			that counts.
			Open.
			I believe the rules are understood
			by all.
			The weapons conversion, Lieutenant
			Burke?
			Complete, Captain.
			Signal received... locked on.
			She's really been stripped down,
			Captain.
			The only offensive systems you
			need will be simulated by
			computer.
			What's the Zakdornian word for
			"mismatch?"
			Challenge! We do not whine about
			the inequities of life.
			And how you perform in a
			"mismatch" is precisely what
			interests Starfleet. After all
			--
			-- when one is in the superior
			position, one is expected to win.
			Screen off. Data, you have the
			bridge.
			Lieutenant Commander Data -- I
			am intrigued by your challenge.
			Doctor Pulaski informed me of your
			desire to play a game of
			Strategema.
			But I have expressed no such
			interest.
			What Commander Data means is that
			he would never have had the nerve
			to ask you himself, but I know
			he is very interested in pitting
			his skill against yours.
			Play a machine? Why should I wish
			to?
			I don't blame you. It's no fun
			going into a game when you know
			you're going to lose.
			But I wouldn't lose, and now
			you're no doubt going to make
			me prove it to you.
			Come on, Data, you can't let that
			pass.
			Indeed I...
			...Cannot.
			Then you will play for the honor
			of your ship.
			Honor of the ship. It's your
			reputation that's on the line.
			With my knowledge of the
			Enterprise's security override,
			we may be able to convince the
			sensors that an enemy ship is
			approaching. Their instruments
			would "lie" to them.
			If you can pull that off, Mister
			Worf, it might just give us the
			edge we're looking for.
			But what about the viewscreen?
			If I am successful, the computer
			will project a false image of the
			enemy ship on the main viewscreen.
			And unless they run to a window
			and look out....
			... They're going to fall for it!
			The lining is still smooth, and
			we ought to be able to do
			something with the dilithium chips
			we scavenged.
			Sure the system is functional,
			but without antimatter what
			difference does it make?
			Geordi, I have to return to the
			Enterprise.
			Wes, we've only got thirty-two
			hours.
			This is important.
			This isn't?
			Attempt the routing bypass here!
			If it works, they will be
			surprised.
			Where'm I gonna get the
			opti-cable?
			Anywhere.
			Sir, I left an experiment running
			on the Enterprise. May I go back
			and shut it down?
			It's that important?
			It has to be monitored. And it
			is my final grade in plasma
			physics.
			In the present context, what did
			she mean by, "Bust him up?"
			Doctor Pulaski, in her own way, is
			instructing you to take the
			shortest route to victory.
			As opposed to what?
			Begin!
			I can't believe it. The
			"computer" was beaten by flesh
			and blood.
			You advanced quite far against
			such a worthy opponent.
			Thoroughly enjoyable, Mister Data.
			I am at your disposal for a
			rematch.
			Thank you, but there would be no
			point.
			How can you lose? You're supposed
			to be infallible!
			Obviously I am not.
			Message from the Hathaway, sir.
			On screen.
			I'd like to request permission
			for Ensign Crusher to reboard the
			Enterprise, Captain.
			Why?
			Apparently he was in such a hurry
			to be part of the away team, he
			left several critical experiments
			unattended.
			Have you any objection?
			He should be escorted, and have
			no contact with anything save his
			research.
			Permission granted.
			Mister Burke, handle that.
			I saw no sense in Riker choosing
			him anyway -- he is just a
			non-commissioned child.
			I can't believe I forgot about
			this. Good lesson not to let
			excitement cloud your thinking.
			Yeah.
			This is really delicate ... I
			spent six weeks setting it up.
			Lot of work.
			Oh, no. It's ruined.
			That's too bad. Look, is this
			going to take much longer?
			I have to dispose of it safely...
			This is really volatile... I
			better beam it off the Enterprise
			and leave it particalized.
			Fine, let's just do it.
			I'll transfer the coordinates to
			the Transporter Room.
			Where is Commander Data?
			He has temporarily removed himself
			from bridge duty, sir.
			Your crew is excellently trained,
			Captain. A tribute to your
			leadership. Though I doubt their
			extensive preparation will be
			needed.
			How so?
			I do not expect "Captain" Riker
			to present much of a challenge.
			Mister Kolrami -- may I speak with
			you in private?
			I would like to know the root of
			your prejudice for my
			second-in-command.
			Captain, I don't --
			Mister Kolrami -- you have been
			nothing but denigrating and
			abusive of Commander Riker since
			boarding this ship. I should like
			an explanation.
			Having studied William Riker's
			file prior to this assignment --
			I have found him wanting.
			In what regard?
			His record is exemplary, but as
			you well know, a starship captain
			is not manufactured -- he, or she,
			is born from inside -- from the
			character of the individual.
			My interviews have revealed a man
			who displays circumstantially
			inappropriate joviality, belying
			the seriousness of his station.
			Don't confuse style with intent.
			Only a fool would question
			Commander Riker's dedication to
			Starfleet and the men and women
			under his command. Riker is the
			finest officer I have ever served
			with.
			We shall see if your faith is well
			founded.
			The test is if a crew will follow
			where Commander Riker leads. His
			joviality is the way he creates
			that loyalty. And I'll match his
			command style against your
			statistics anytime.
			Come in, please.
			Data?
			Counselor. Is something wrong?
			That was going to be my question.
			With my repository of knowledge,
			I expected to perform better
			against a humanoid life-form.
			Some of our greatest advances have
			come from analyzing failure.
			While it can be ego-bruising --
			Counselor -- I do not have an
			"ego."
			Yes... well, a loss... can be
			disheartening --
			Counselor -- I do not have a --
			Data! There are two ways to
			handle defeat. You can lose
			confidence or you can learn from
			your mistakes.
			That is what troubles me. I made
			no mistakes.
			Hence, I have conducted a
			diagnostic check of all of my
			programs, and now I am cross-checking
			with the ship's computer.
			Is all of that necessary?
			I believe so. I have proven to
			be vulnerable, and at the present
			time, skepticism must be awarded
			my deductions.
			That is why you haven't been on
			the bridge.
			Yes, the captain would be ill
			advised to rely upon my judgement.
			Data, I think you're really
			overreacting. I'm sure you're
			all right.
			I, however, am not sure.
			What's that?
			My experiment from the Enterprise.
			Wes?
			It dealt with high-energy plasma
			reactions --
			-- with anti-matter.
			You went back to the Enterprise
			just to get this... Wes, you
			cheated.
			No, sir. You told me to
			improvise.
			The hard part's gonna be
			calibrating the thermal curve
			required to start a controlled
			reaction.
			Assuming you can -- can you
			regulate the reaction?
			There's just enough crystal to
			do it.
			We plan to channel the reaction
			through the chips.
			Are we good?
			Better than good. Great.
			Brilliant.
			This is going to be fun.
			Carry on.
			Come in, please.
			All right, Data, enough of this.
			Doctor?
			How long are you going to sit
			sulking like Achilles in his tent?
			I am running diagnostic --
			You might be able to sell Troi
			with that story, but not me.
			You're smarting because you got
			beat. Well, it happens.
			No, Doctor, this is not ego. I
			am concerned about giving the
			captain unsound advice.
			I wish I'd never maneuvered you
			into playing that damn game. I'm
			sorry.
			For what? It is done, and perhaps
			just as well. This has indicated
			that I am damaged in some fashion.
			I must find the malfunction.
			The simulation begins in one hour.
			You'll have warp drive, Captain,
			though it may not be what you
			expected.
			I'd say that calls for an
			explanation.
			Sir, we'll be able to give you
			warp one...
			-- for just under two seconds.
			Well, not enough for an escape
			but used as a surprise, sufficient
			for gaining a strategic advantage.
			Sir, all of this is "theoretical."
			And if the theory fails to pay
			off?
			Ever driven a Grenthemen Water
			Hopper?
			Yes.
			Ever popped the clutch?
			You're telling me we'll stall
			the Hathaway.
			... and the Enterprise will waltz
			over and pulverize us.
			Now, let me see if I fully
			understand this. You're
			suggesting that Commander Data
			is suffering from a profound loss
			of confidence, and you feel that
			only I can restore the balance.
			Yes, sir.
			Both Deanna and I have tried,
			Captain, and we're not getting
			through to him.
			Don't you think you both might
			be overreacting? Data is not
			capable of the emotions you are
			assigning to him.
			The effect is the same whether
			it's caused by human emotions or
			android algorithms. Data's not
			on the bridge, and I don't think
			he's going to be on the bridge
			until we find some way to address
			his problem.
			I am less than an hour away from
			a battle simulation, and I must
			handhold an android?
			The burdens of command.
			Come in, please.
			Commander, I require your presence
			on the bridge.
			Captain, with all due respect,
			perhaps it would be better if you
			choose another to serve as your
			first --
			Data, you are my first officer.
			I have not been able to isolate
			the problem. I might make a
			mistake.
			Yes, you might. But that does
			not alter your duty -- to this
			ship, and to me.
			Do you know how to formulate a
			premise?
			Yes.
			Then formulate one now: How do
			I handle Riker and the Hathaway?
			I'll await your answer on the
			bridge.
			Commander, it is possible to
			commit no mistakes -- and still
			lose.
			That is not a weakness. That is
			"life".
			Thank you, Captain, I believe I
			understand.
			And Data, leave the hesitation
			and self-doubt in your quarters.
			I have several examples of
			Commander Riker's battle
			technique. At the Academy, he
			calculated a sensory blind spot
			on a Tholian vessel and hid
			within it during a battle
			simulation. And as a lieutenant
			aboard the Potemkin, his solution
			to a crisis was to shut down all
			power, and hang over a planet's
			magnetic pole, thus confusing his
			opponent's sensors.
			And from these specifics, what
			general conclusion can you
			extrapolate?
			Only twenty-one percent of the
			time does he rely upon traditional
			tactics.
			So the captain must be prepared
			for extreme cunning.
			Counselor, Commander Riker will
			assume that we have made this
			analysis, and knowing that we know
			his methods, he will alter them.
			But knowing that we know that he
			knows that we know he might choose
			to return to his usual pattern.
			You're over-analyzing. Human
			nature cannot be denied.
			What kind of man is Commander
			Riker?
			He is a fighter.
			Yes.
			The weaker his position, the more
			aggressive will be his posture.
			And he won't give up.
			Then despite whatever logical
			choices he is offered, he must
			be --
			-- The man that he is. Yes.
			Is that a failing in humans?
			You'll have to decide that for
			yourself.
			Screen on.
			The hunt begins, Number One.
			We're ready -- just remember,
			Enterprise -- Captain Riker has
			never lost.
			Begin!
			Screen off. Set course
			two-two-three mark two-five-seven,
			full impulse power. Initiate
			Kumeh maneuver.
			The Kumeh maneuver -- why are they
			starting out with such a
			recognizable ploy?
			He's teasing -- wants us to reveal
			our tactics on his terms. Worf?
			Counter with Talupian stratagem
			on instrument sighting.
			Agreed. Three-quarters impulse,
			full on my command. Ensign Nagel,
			maximum shields.
			Mister Worf, prepare your little
			surprise.
			Course three-one-seven mark
			seven-three. Present minimal
			aspect. Ready warp one, optimal
			spread on simulated torpedoes.
			Captain -- Romulan warship
			approaching fast from astern!
			What the -- ?!
			He came from nowhere, sir!
			Bring us about, Ensign -- maximum
			shields!
			Disengage modified beams.
			Weapon-systems full -- lock on!
			Open a hailing frequency.
			I can't, sir.
			There's nothing there.
			Warp three, evasive!
			Disengage weapons, re-engage
			modified beam.
			He is quite good.
			He is the best!
			Computer reports simulated damage
			to several aft decks. Repair time
			three-point-six days.
			How did he do that?
			Mister Worf must have overridden
			our sensor codes and played some
			holographic games. Data, input
			a new code.
			Attack posture, circumvental
			attitude. Prepare beams for
			photon mode.
			Bye-bye, Hathaway.
			Computers report heavy damage to
			Enterprise, sir.
			They're moving off. Why not go
			after them?
			Because they're not through coming
			after us! Geordi, Wesley --
			prepare warp jump.
			There are no guarantees here, sir.
			There never are, Lieutenant. I'm
			going to trust your expertise.
			Secure your stations, gentlemen.
			Stand by for my signal.
			Ready photon torpedoes.
			Captain, sensors picking up a
			Ferengi warship closing at warp
			five.
			Did you input that new code?
			Yes, sir!
			Mister Worf -- I didn't give you
			enough credit, continue the
			simulation.
			Divert all power to shields!
			Sever modified beams, engage
			phasers and target!
			Stay between the Hathaway and the
			Ferengi!
			That's no ghost attacking the
			Enterprise. That's real!
			We must assist, sir!
			With what?! We have no offensive
			weapons!
			Where are my weapons?
			Unavailable, sir! We cannot
			disengage the modified beams --
			the connections have been fused!
			We must retreat!
			Unacceptable! I have crew on the
			Hathaway.
			Captain, the Ferengi have broken
			off their attack.
			Drop shields. Transport the away
			team aboard.
			Transporter functions gone, sir!
			Shields reduced to one-fifth
			intensity.
			Use their moment of indecision
			to escape!
			I have forty crewmembers --
			-- Who should be sacrificed to
			save a thousand! Acceptable
			tactical losses, considering the
			circumstances.
			Not to me!
			Notify Starfleet -- priority.
			Hail Ferengi on my command.
			Formulate alternatives.
			As the Starfleet observer I am
			ordering you to withdraw!
			I am the captain of this vessel!
			Your order is nullified!
			Ferengi on Main Viewer.
			I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of
			the Federation Starship, USS
			Enterprise. Why have you attacked
			my ship?
			Why was your ship combative with
			another Federation vessel of
			"lesser" design? Why do you now
			protect your former target? What
			is its value to you?
			Our probes indicate you were aware
			of our approach, yet took no
			action.
			Your answers will dictate our
			response.
			I have refrained from launching
			a counter-attack in the hope that
			we can resolve this peacefully.
			Our probes indicate that you are
			crippled, and the ship you protect
			has no weaponry, no light-speed
			drive, and only scarce crew.
			This makes no sense to us.
			Unless it contains something very
			valuable?
			I am Bractor, leader of the
			Ferengi attack vessel Kreechta.
			I shall have the secret of the
			other Federation ship. If you
			surrender it to me, I will allow
			your Enterprise to leave unharmed.
			You have ten of your minutes.
			Sir, they're massing a surge of
			power. We're being scanned...
			they've locked on!
			Data?
			Our shields will not
			withstand another assault.
			Then there are no options.
			Retreat or die.
			Captain's log, supplemental. Due
			to a grave miscalculation on my
			part, the Enterprise has been
			subjected to a withering attack
			by the Ferengi. I find myself
			with little time to decide the
			fate of forty of my crew stranded
			aboard the derelict Hathaway.
			I'm open to suggestions.
			Captain, we are now capable of
			launching a limited number of
			photon torpedoes.
			I have given you my advice,
			Captain. The Hathaway is
			expendable.
			Commander Riker is hailing, sir.
			On screen. Have you been
			monitoring communications, Number
			One?
			Yes, sir. And Kolrami's right.
			You must save the Enterprise.
			You will be left defenseless.
			When Bractor closes in, we'll hit
			our warp drive and take our
			chances.
			Your what?!
			We have a limited, two-second warp
			capability.
			Impossible! That ship was
			rendered warp inactive!
			I told you he was the best.
			I should wish to hear about this
			later, but now I need to work
			something out with Data.
			Premise: The Ferengi wish to
			capture the Hathaway believing
			it to be of value. Therefore,
			we must remove the ship from their
			field of interest.
			They will soon relocate it after
			a two-second warp and --
			There is a way. Are you with
			us, Number One?
			Yes, sir. We're all here --
			anxiously waiting for you to pull
			another rabbit out of your hat.
			Data.
			At the captain's signal, we will
			fire four photon torpedoes
			directly at the Hathaway. A
			millisecond before detonation,
			the computer will trigger your
			warp jump.
			I think I hate this plan.
			Data, we don't even know for sure
			if our warp jump will work.
			If the warp engines should fail
			to function, the result could
			be... unfortunate.
			Very unfortunate... we will be
			dead.
			Captain Riker, I can't order you
			to do this...
			What the hell. Nobody said life
			was safe.
			The advantage is that it will
			appear from the Kreechta's
			perspective -- as though you were
			destroyed in the explosion.
			That will only deceive them for
			a few minutes. Their sensors will
			soon locate us.
			A few minutes is all we need,
			Mister Worf, because you're going
			to prepare a surprise for them.
			Then we are agreed; on my mark
			in four minutes.
			Remember, Geordi, if the
			implementation is off by a
			millisecond, the Hathaway will
			not survive.
			Data, that's the one part of this
			plan that we're all absolutely
			sure about.
			Are we ready, Number One?
			Good luck to both of you.
			Bractor.
			I will wait no longer, Picard.
			You needn't, Bractor. The answer
			-- is "no."
			Your actions have been wholly
			criminal, and you will not profit
			by them.
			You are a fool.
			How can you stop us?
			You feel the Hathaway has value?
			Well, I deny you your prize.
			Fire!
			Destroy your own rather than
			endure the ignominy of defeat and
			capture?
			I did not think the Federation
			had such iron.
			You had no claim to that ship --
			it was ours to destroy.
			As you are ours to destroy!
			You can try.
			Enterprise targeted, Leader.
			Leader! There is another
			Federation ship closing -- a
			starship!
			Maximum shields! We've been
			outmaneuvered. Retreat!
			Captain, our sensors show no
			Federation starship nearby.
			Of course not, Mister Burke. That
			was Klingon guile.
			You made it, Number One. Smooth
			ride?
			Different!
			We'll lock on and pick you up.
			With pleasure.
			I must admit -- your Commander
			Riker has acquitted himself
			quite... admirably.
			And Captain... so have you. My
			report to Starfleet will be quite
			favorable.
			Thank you, Mister Kolrami.
			Initiate recovery procedures,
			continue repairs, plot a course
			for the nearest starbase.
			Captain's log, supplemental. With
			the transporter repaired and my
			crew safely back aboard, we have
			officially ended the first
			Starfleet battle simulation.
			Why have you suspended the game?
			Because this is not a rematch --
			you have made a mockery of me.
			Data, you beat him!
			No, sir -- it is a stalemate.
			No game of Strategema has ever
			gone this high.
			What did you do?
			I simply altered my "premise" for
			playing.
			Explain.
			Working under the assumption that
			Kolrami is attempting to win, it
			is reasonable to assume that he
			expects me to play for the same
			goal.
			You weren't?
			No. I was playing only for a
			standoff -- a "draw." While
			Kolrami was dedicated to winning,
			I was able to pass up obvious
			avenues of advancement and settle
			for a balance.
			Theoretically, I should be able
			to challenge him indefinitely.
			Then you have beaten him.
			A matter of perspective. In the
			strictest sense I did not win.
			Data!
			I busted him up.
