			Captain's log, Stardate 42502.7.
			We are traveling in the Omega
			Twelve System traversing between
			a clustering of small planets that
			form the coalition of Madena VI.
			Each of these planets is populated
			by separate humanoid people who
			co-exist and trade technology and
			minerals under a precarious but
			successful treaty.
			We have an unidentified vessel
			approaching.
			Give me grid markers.
			Sector three-nine-five-six,
			mark zero-nine-one.
			Sensor readings place overall
			dimension of vehicle an
			interplanetary cargo ship.
			One life sign on board, appears
			to be humanoid.
			A vessel of that size usually
			maintains a crew of six.
			Minimum armament present.
			Sensors show cargo holds are
			empty.
			The course is inconsistent with
			normal cargo routes.
			This could be a primitive method
			to elude detection.
			Readout shows a burnout in
			inertial guidance system...
			The pilot is attempting to hold
			his vessel in check manually.
			That could be a pretense.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			have just encountered and
			identified an interplanetary cargo
			vessel which is apparently in need
			of emergency assistance. We will
			make every effort to do so.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			This is the USS Enterprise.
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard, over.
			And this is the cargo ship
			Erstwhile "limping" and "skidding"
			off course. Captain Okona at your
			service. As you see, there is
			no need for phasers, Captain.
			I'm harmless and not quite ready
			yet for mercy killing.
			You were never considered a danger
			to us, Captain Okona.
			It's a shame. I can remember when
			I was at least considered a
			"risk."
			The ship is in viewer range now,
			Captain.
			Main Viewer on.
			I'm the owner and operator of this
			craft and since we both know you
			scanned my vessel, you know I'm
			alone and empty...
			... and it's truly a rare occasion
			for a man of my charm, beauty and
			talent.
			But then with the condition of
			this vessel I'm glad I have no
			responsibilities except for myself
			till I can get some repairs.
			Counselor, can you read him?
			His emotions suggest that he is
			mischievous, irreverent and
			somewhat brazen.
			And some other things...
			The word that seems to describe
			him best is "rogue."
			Rogue? Accessing "rogue."
			Cad, knave, rake, rascal,
			scoundrel, villain.
			Yes, all of that, but he shows
			no malevolence, or ill will.
			What form of assistance can we
			offer you, Captain?
			I had a burnout on my guidance
			system. I'd appreciate it if I
			could use your facilities to
			repair it.
			It would be possible.
			Estimate, Mister Data.
			Time for repair would be seven
			hours sixteen minutes.
			Okona will have to shut down while
			we verify specifications.
			Lieutenant Worf, prepare security
			procedures.
			We can accommodate you.
			I'll allow him limited access.
			If you'll prepare to shut down
			your engines we'll lock on
			tractors and beam you aboard.
			Many thanks, Captain Picard.
			Transporter Chief, prepare to beam
			aboard from Tractor lock bearing.
			Yes Number One, at your command.
			Is that a woman's voice I hear?
			Yes. Now please follow the
			directions of Commander Riker so
			our ship can get back to its
			normal routine.
			Something funny, Commander Riker.
			The unexpected, like what's
			happening now, IS our normal
			routine.
			Hold it steady, Wesley. We're
			ready to link up. On my
			command...
			Aye Number One.
			Easy... easy...
			Engage. Shut down engines,
			Captain Okona.
			Transporter Room proceed with
			Beaming Operation. I'm on my way.
			Yes, Commander.
			Your weapons, please.
			You're the tough one on this ship.
			The muscle man.
			Security.
			That's the usual name for warriors
			nowadays.
			It's more of a piece of jewelry
			than a weapon. A remembrance.
			It will be returned when you
			leave.
			Welcome aboard, Captain Okona.
			I'm Commander Riker.
			If you turn over the inoperative
			part to Lieutenant La Forge he'll
			begin repairs.
			I'd be most happy to do the work
			myself, I'm sort of a "hands on"
			type...
			That will not be permitted.
			Can I at least watch? Maybe offer
			some suggestions?
			I think that could be arranged...
			Here you are, Lieutenant. I leave
			it in your capable hands.
			No, this is Lieutenant La Forge,
			I'm only an ensign.
			Well ensigns have names, don't
			they?
			Wesley... Wesley Crusher..
			Nice to meet you Ensign "Wesley
			Wesley" Crusher.
			And thank you for beaming me here
			and inviting me to see a truly
			beautiful woman.
			You have the majestic carriage
			and loveliness that could surely
			be traced back to the noble
			families who once ruled romantic
			lands with benevolent and tender
			hands.
			I'm sure you said that to many
			ladies and it was no more true
			then, than it is now.
			Of course,
			But it's how I say it that's most
			important. The feeling, the
			warmth, the attraction I have for
			you,
			the attraction that we share.
			I haven't heard that approach in
			years... it is refreshing...
			Mister Okona seems to have excellent
			vision and a healthy libido.
			Which could add to the security
			problem. I'll supervise him
			closely.
			I'm sure you will, Worf.
			If you'll follow Lieutenant La
			Forge, we'll get right to work.
			Now isn't that a beautifully
			formed picture of sex appeal?
			I do not know what you mean.
			I am an android.
			Well then... Have you seen any
			great looking computers lately?
			That's a joke.
			It's funny.
			Yes, of course it is.
			It's the Zelebium contacts that
			wore down and then fused. Why
			not replace them with Tricellite?
			Tricellite isn't available in this
			system. It wouldn't be available
			to me if I have to replace it.
			I don't think your spacecraft will
			outlast the part.
			You mean the age of it or the way
			I fly it?
			The stress test shows that you
			tend to push it beyond its
			designed capabilities.
			Lieutenant La Forge, I've never
			been told that I'm somewhat
			reckless in a kinder, or more
			gentlemanly manner; but since the
			pattern of my life has relegated
			me to interplanetary speed
			deliveries rather than universal
			exploration, I'm forced to add a
			flamboyancy and a zest to the
			doldrums of my existence.
			Captain Okona, I don't know
			whether I'd rather take a flight
			with you or listen to you talk.
			Thank you Ensign Crusher, Crusher.
			It's Wesley, Wesley.
			I'll make it easy on both of us.
			I'll just call you Tiger.
			Captain Picard is not fond of
			nicknames.
			Your gallant Captain Picard. I'd
			like to meet him... I'll stroll
			on the bridge and say hello.
			You are not permitted on the
			bridge. You are restricted to
			your quarters or the Ten-Forward
			lounge unless escorted by a
			crewmember.
			I've broken some small rules
			before.
			You do and besides the bells and
			lights that will go off, our
			benevolent and kindly Lieutenant
			Worf will offer you a new kind
			of greeting.
			Well then, would you escort me
			to C deck?
			I'm busy rebuilding your ship.
			Then Mister Data sir, I would feel
			privileged if you allow me to be
			in your company while you escort
			me to my destination...
			You ever been cold?
			No.
			How about warm?
			The temperature on this vessel
			is regulated to within a fraction
			of a degree of the perfect comfort
			range. I am also able to react
			to any changes just as a humanoid.
			How about drunk? Ever do that?
			That is not possible. One moment.
			I was correct. I am not designed
			to react to any synthenol intake
			but apparently it is possible for
			me to become intoxicated.
			I don't understand that at all.
			It seems that I have been adapting
			some human peculiarities over the
			last three tours of duty.
			What about love?
			The act or the emotion?
			They're both the same to me.
			I believe that deduction to be
			inaccurate.
			Maybe.
			Life is like loading twice your
			cargo weight on your spacecraft...
			if it's canaries and you can keep
			half of them flying all the time,
			you're all right.
			Don't you get it?
			Get what?
			The punch line... The gag... That
			was a joke I told you.
			I still do not understand.
			You don't know what a joke is?
			Of course I do.
			A joke is an antic, a caper,
			mischief, prank, trick, quip,
			witticism.
			That's the dictionary meaning.
			I'm talking about humor, fun.
			Do you know what "funny" is?
			Is that C-nine-two-nine?
			The room to the left. Why?
			You probably wouldn't understand
			that either...
			What's the status of the repair?
			On schedule. The difficulty is
			Okona has to be able to repair
			this part himself next time.
			Commander, do you know much about
			him?
			Just that he's an interesting man.
			He's a lot more than that. He's
			a capable engineer.
			In a practical sense he's
			excellent.
			We've seen him handle his ship,
			and he certainly knows how to
			handle people.
			Everything you say is true.
			Then why is he what he is?
			Why is he operating a cargo route
			alone rather than being a member
			of a large organization like we
			are?
			Yes, that's it.
			I would say because he chooses
			to do exactly what he does.
			A cargo master?
			An ensign in Engineering?
			His choice. Someday you'll make
			yours.
			I already have.
			Okona is right.
			You agree that I am missing a very
			important human factor.
			All I said was I agree with Okona
			that you never smile or laugh.
			At least I've never seen you do
			it.
			Do you? Ever?
			I never knew I had to.
			It's not a "had to." Even Captain
			Picard can't order you to be
			happy.
			But I am not unhappy. I just do
			not seem to break out in laughter
			with everyone else when Okona says
			certain things.
			You mean when he tells a joke.
			That's it, isn't it? You don't
			have any idea what a joke is.
			Of course I do.
			It is a witticism, a gag, a bon
			mot, a fluctuation of words which
			concludes with "trick" ending,
			it is...
			Whoa, slow down. Now Data,
			there's just you and me here and
			nobody is going to know what we
			talked about. My job here places
			me under some obligations, like
			a vow of secrecy. I can't repeat
			anything I hear or see. Now the
			obligation of the patron is to
			tell the truth, otherwise I'm
			being placed under a commitment
			to keep a secret about "nothing."
			That's not fair. It's called
			wasted honor. You understand?
			I understand better than you
			think. You just told me a joke
			and I am not laughing.
			I can see that.
			Maybe it was not funny.
			It was funny.
			How can you be sure?
			I've used it before. Everybody
			else at least smiles. It's you,
			Data.
			I agree. Now what do I do about
			it?
			When most people have trouble,
			they look to a more intelligent
			and learned being for assistance.
			In your case, I'd suggest you go
			to a bigger computer.
			I wish to learn about jokes...
			There are books, films, and tapes.
			But the only animate object would
			be a comedian.
			Show me one of those.
			Specify type, please.
			Humanoid. One who is able to
			understand and tell a joke.
			Physical or cerebral style.
			Show me both.
			I will access a list.
			That one. RW nine, three, two,
			one, six -- twentieth century.
			Program installation complete,
			you may enter.
			Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
			And thank you for bringing me
			here.
			I want to know what is funny.
			Things that make you laugh are
			funny?
			Nothing makes me laugh, but I
			still want to do it.
			How much time do we have?
			Time has no meaning in this
			instance. It could be endless.
			I think we're going to need it
			all.
			I assure you, I am completely
			trainable and capable of
			indoctrination. Show me what is
			funny.
			Okay, try this.
			Well?
			That is considered funny?
			It was till a few seconds ago.
			You mean if you twist your face,
			bend over at the waist, mess up
			your hair, and cross your eyes
			it is a pretense that would be
			funny.
			I have to admit it's a little
			ridiculous, but that's part of
			being funny. Clowns are
			ridiculous, but they make people
			laugh. Now try it.
			Can you juggle, whistle, sing?
			How about write or paint? I have
			a house that needs painting. It's
			hard work, but at least you don't
			have to be funny. Just a strong
			wrist, a good eye, and an
			affection for watching water base
			off-white dry slowly.
			I can do everything else that I
			want to do. I just want to know
			what is funny. I want to be able
			to involve myself in other
			people's laughter.
			I want to "join in."
			We'll try. You have to remember
			your "body English" and gestures.
			Now you're going to learn some
			jokes.
			Proceed.
			We'll start with some standards...
			This traveling salesman...
			Access faster...
			... comes up to his farmhouse
			and...
			Faster. Move to maximum speed.
			This gentleman went to see his
			surgeon and was informed that he
			needed an operation. The man
			thought about that and then said,
			"I would like a second opinion."
			The doctor said, "Okay, you are
			ugly too."
			Was I funny?
			That joke has been funny for over
			four hundred years.
			We'll now have a minute's silence
			for its passing.
			I was not funny...
			Forget it. Try another joke.
			Who was that woman I saw you with?
			Lieutenant Commander Data, report
			to the Main Bridge immediately.
			I repeat, report to the Main
			Bridge immediately.
			I will be back.
			Bring new jokes...
			We have an "unidentified" in
			Sector four.
			Unidentified craft Sector four
			to Sector four two six one.
			Overtaking us, no response to our
			hailing.
			Open hailing frequencies in all
			languages and on all channels.
			Hailing frequencies open. No
			response.
			Sensors report a minimum range
			combat craft of the Squadron
			Class, twenty-six crew.
			Captain, they have locked phasers.
			Phasers?
			Regulations call for a Yellow
			Alert.
			It's too small of a craft to be
			of any threat to us. Do you
			agree, Lieutenant Worf?
			We could blow it out of space
			before it could scratch our hull.
			And I doubt that they are so
			primitive that they wouldn't know
			it. Ensign Crusher, reduce speed
			to allow them to overtake.
			May I ask why, sir?
			They show a great deal of courage.
			Perhaps I would like to show them
			some respect, or perhaps I'm just
			curious.
			I understand, Captain. Would a
			"courteous" Yellow Alert apply
			at this time?
			That won't be necessary, Number
			One. But continue to hail them
			and prepare for a gentlemanly
			surrender if needed.
			Still no response to our hail.
			The "stranger" vessel has slowed
			and is holding its position.
			Captain, we are being hailed.
			On screen.
			I am Debin of the planet Atlec.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the USS Enterprise... What is
			the reason for this aggressive
			approach?
			You are towing a spacecraft of
			a known criminal.
			It was in need of emergency
			repairs. It was our obligation
			to assist.
			You have a man by the name of
			Okona aboard.
			I want him.
			On what authority?
			He is guilty of crimes committed
			on the planet Atlec. I expect
			him to be turned over to my
			authority immediately.
			What crimes?
			That is neither important or
			necessary. I want Okona now!
			Captain, we have another Class
			four armed spacecraft approaching,
			from the opposite sector...
			Another ship from Atlec?
			Similar in specifications and
			capabilities, but a variation in
			markings and hailing language.
			Hold your position, Mister Debin.
			Cut off Main Screen.
			Identify approaching craft.
			Sensors indicate it to be a
			security vessel from the planet
			Straleb.
			We could swat both mosquitoes
			easily.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			They are returning our hail on
			the proper channel.
			On screen.
			I am Secretary Kushell from the
			Legation of Unity of the planet
			Straleb.
			I am Captain Picard.
			We know who you are, Captain
			Picard. We have been monitoring
			your communications and we know
			of the demands made by Debin of
			the planet Atlec.
			Then you know that we intend no
			hostile interaction with either
			of you.
			You only have to concede to one
			demand.
			The word "demand" has the tone
			of finality.
			It is a word I have chosen.
			We demand you turn Okona over to
			us immediately.
			Mute the Main Viewer.
			Lieutenant Worf, Mister Okona to the
			Main Bridge immediately.
			Yes sir.
			Engage the screen.
			The same "demand" has been made
			by the Atlec legation.
			I have no interest in their
			request. We intend to back up our
			legal right to Okona.
			I'd rather you didn't escalate
			this situation any further.
			You're my son. You obey orders,
			you do not interfere with them.
			We are prepared to take Okona by
			force if we have to. The honor
			and prestige of this nation are
			at stake.
			We are ready to die for that.
			We do not intend for that to be
			at our hand. I will respond to
			your request shortly --
			Main Viewer off.
			I have orders to escort you to
			the Main Bridge immediately.
			I'm sure it can wait a few
			minutes.
			Now!!
			I'd like that, but I have orders.
			Some other time then.
			Just remember, it took three armed
			men to rip me from your arms.
			Am I going to meet Captain Picard?
			Definitely.
			Did I say something funny?
			Captain Picard, this is Thadiun
			Okona.
			In there... We'll talk in there...
			Mister Okona, you were welcomed on
			board and given the security of
			this ship openly and without any
			undue investigation. In turn the
			only obligation we placed you
			under was that you do not come
			aboard the Enterprise under false
			pretenses. It seems that you did.
			If you mean my "socializing" with
			the members of the crew?
			No, you are free to interact with
			the members of the crew. First,
			I'm talking about a man named
			Debin. Are you familiar with him?
			He's from Atlec. I've had
			dealings with some of his family.
			Then perhaps you can explain why
			his spacecraft is prepared to
			attack us unless we give him
			custody of you.
			I can't explain.
			Then tell me why Kushell of the
			planet Straleb is demanding the
			same thing?
			Is he here also?
			And quite adamant. Now answer
			please. What crimes have you
			committed?
			I am not a criminal.
			Why do these men want you?
			I can't say.
			You will say. You're on my ship.
			It wouldn't be the honorable thing
			to do. I may be many less than
			auspicious things, but I am a
			gentleman. I won't break that
			code.
			They are prepared to attack the
			Enterprise.
			That would be crazy. They
			wouldn't stand a chance...
			Exactly.
			Then perhaps you could give me
			some reasons as to why I should
			consider destroying these people
			to save you?
			I can't think of any right now.
			Neither can I.
			Put Debin on screen.
			Have you made your decision yet,
			Captain?
			No. You've made your requests
			but you haven't told me why.
			It's a personal matter.
			I'm afraid that's not good enough.
			Not good enough?? You're forcing
			me to embarrass my family by
			demanding reasons.
			It was Okona... He's been bringing
			Yanar gifts, flowers, and even
			poetry for the past five months.
			He took advantage. Then he left
			her like this. I want him.
			I do sympathize with you. If you
			will allow me just a little more
			time.
			Why, so you can turn him over to
			Kushell? You do that and I'll
			blow his ship away and Okona with
			it.
			You'll be dust before you aim your
			first missile. I have a perfect
			right to Okona. He's a thief.
			He stole the Jewel of Thesia.
			A national heritage.
			A "thing." An "item." My case
			involves the victimization of a
			human form. My daughter.
			That's him!! I'll have him now.
			He's mine.
			One at a time. Who accuses me
			of stealing?
			I do, you thief. Me and my son,
			Benzan. Okona was my son's
			friend. He took advantage of that
			friendship to plunder a national
			treasure.
			What do you have to say about that
			Okona?
			Nothing right now. Let them do
			all the talking.
			Gentlemen if you please!
			You will get my decision as soon
			as I can confer with my advisors
			and in the interest of maintaining
			peace I am jamming communications
			between your two ships. Picard
			out.
			Okona, Doctor, Counselor,
			Lieutenant Worf, Geordi, the
			conference room if you please.
			Have Doctor Pulaski join us...
			Dishonesty, lust, and now hunger.
			You really are extremely basic
			Mister Okona.
			Last meals always taste the best
			and hunger won't make me a better
			person.
			That's probably true.
			Neither one of the allegations
			is considered a capital crime.
			I'll never reach either of those
			planets alive. They have lost
			too much face over these
			incidents.
			And yet it provides the
			possibility of even more violence.
			You're not afraid of those two
			or what they can do to you.
			It's what I may have to do to them
			that concerns me. If I turn you
			over to Debin, I will have to deal
			with Kushell. If you go to
			Kushell, I will have Debin to
			administer to. Or perhaps both
			of them would decide to attack
			us. Fatalities could be total.
			I hate to have to be the one to
			say this, but you don't owe me
			anything.
			I'm well aware of that, but it
			doesn't change anything.
			Are you innocent, Thadiun Okona?
			Innocent? Absolutely not, Captain
			Picard. I'll make no excuses for
			my lifestyle.
			But I have not committed the
			crimes that I've been accused of
			or any others similar.
			Then my predicament is confirmed.
			In that case, Captain, I can't
			make it any easier on you.
			Apparently you've never been
			concerned about making it easier
			on anyone... There are two men
			out there who do not consider this
			a joke and are willing to face
			death as a matter of honor. They
			should be respected, not laughed
			at.
			You seemed to have reached a
			decision about me, Captain.
			Only about what I think you are.
			What to do about it is still a
			problem.
			I'll help you with it.
			Stall Debin and Kushell. Give
			me enough time to get the guidance
			system re-installed and I'll go
			on my own.
			Their ships are bigger and faster
			than yours.
			You'll still be able to warp away
			and I'll take care of myself.
			How will you get away?
			I'll dazzle them with my
			brilliance and dexterity.
			I don't like it.
			You have very little choice.
			I know. It will be impossible
			to stall very long.
			"Just long enough" is all I
			need...
			What are you going to say to Debin
			and Kushell?
			Anything I have to.
			Now you're starting to sound like
			me, Captain.
			Heaven forbid.
			Engage Main Viewer.
			Ah, gentlemen... If you'll just
			bear with me, I have a few
			questions.
			Looks like an excellent job.
			You're quite a craftsman
			Lieutenant La Forge. How soon
			will it be finished?
			What's the rush? I thought you
			liked it here.
			I did. It stopped liking me.
			Time for me to disappear.
			Where will you go?
			A new place, if I make it.
			Don't you ever stay anywhere?
			Not for a long time.
			I know that's the way you want
			to be and it is your choice, but
			I don't understand. You like
			people. Why do you want to be
			alone all the time?
			It's ready. You should be able
			to install this in less than five
			minutes.
			Like you said Geordi, what's the
			rush?
			I have some friends around here.
			One moment please, gentlemen.
			Screen off.
			I've used every pretext I could
			think of. The result is they've
			aimed their full ordinance at us
			and are prepared to attack. I
			can't delay any longer.
			I'm not leaving.
			We've gone over this before. I
			thought you made a decision.
			Don't worry, I'm not staying
			either.
			I've decided to surrender myself
			to one of them.
			Which one?
			Put them on screen and place your
			bets. The odds are two to one...
			On screen.
			It took long enough. Now when
			can I have Okona?
			I registered my complaint before
			you. I have first recourse.
			Do not delay your decision again.
			I'm warning you not to do that,
			Captain Picard.
			Yes, both of you are most adept
			at issuing warnings.
			Mister Okona has volunteered to
			deal with this himself.
			I'll speak my piece before I walk
			to your gallows. As I said before
			I am not a thief. I am also not
			a character of exceptional good
			name and reputation; so, as I
			never chose to become a thief,
			I have never chosen to become a
			father either.
			Given the choice between the two
			I must say that marriage to the
			beautiful and affectionate Yanar
			is a much more pleasant sentence.
			So my dear Yanar, if you would
			do me the honor of becoming my
			wife I will do everything in my
			power to make our marriage happy
			and fruitful.
			No! He can't!
			My son is right. Okona will not
			escape me that way.
			No, that's not what I mean.
			Send him to me. I'll decide his
			fate.
			Why should you decide? Why don't
			I? Since everybody knows Okona
			is the father of this child, why
			should we not allow him to take
			his rightful place?
			I accept.
			You can't accept!
			That's right. Okona is still a
			thief.
			No he's not. Nothing was stolen.
			The Jewel of Thesia!
			It was not stolen by my friend
			Okona.
			Then where is it?
			You could say it was taken into
			"custody" by the rightful heir,
			me.
			Benzan has a certain flair for
			the language that is similar to
			yours.
			A little bit of me might have
			rubbed off on the boy. I didn't
			think he would let me hang.
			You placed great faith in him.
			He's a friend...
			Why would you steal what would
			eventually become yours?
			To present it to Yanar as my vow
			of marriage.
			Yanar is carrying my child.
			Yanar said it was Okona's.
			You were with both these men?
			No, but that's not what is
			important now. What is important
			is who I marry.
			You'll marry me.
			Why should I?
			Because I love you.
			You waited this long to say that?
			You almost allowed Okona to be
			punished, now suddenly you wish
			to marry me?
			I sent the Jewel of Thesia to you
			with Okona to declare us man and
			wife. The politics of our fathers
			would have been settled later.
			So Okona does have the jewel.
			I ordered him to deliver it!
			And waited a little too long to
			do that also. I won't marry you,
			Benzan.
			Then you'll marry Okona.
			I won't marry anyone!
			Don't Yanar. You're angry about
			the embarrassment of all this and
			maybe the timing and approach is
			not the most romantic, but I know
			you love Benzan and I don't want
			to see you throw away that feeling
			because we adults do not know how
			to behave properly.
			If Benzan could speak with the
			same integrity as you do, maybe
			it would be different.
			I carried your messages back and
			forth for almost six months. I
			smuggled each of you into the
			other's homeland. You feel for
			him the same way he feels for you.
			So for heaven's sake girl, you
			have to marry the boy because I've
			finally run out of words.
			I don't believe that.
			It is mathematically possible.
			Okona defies even the science of
			mathematics.
			Was that funny?
			I do love him.
			Then tell him.
			I'll marry Benzan. It is his
			child.
			It's our child.
			Then I'll have to withdraw my
			charges of theft. By our law
			Benzan must present the jewel to
			his wife.
			I'll be coming for you shortly
			Yanar. We'll find a new planet
			to live on.
			You'll live on Straleb.
			No! You'll live here!
			Gentlemen, this is a matter to
			be settled between yourselves.
			I have only two words for both
			of you.
			Picard out.
			Take over, Will. Mister Okona
			and I are going to drink a toast
			to the newlyweds.
			Weddings bring out emotions in
			me that I never could quite
			understand. I get so sentimental.
			Perhaps it's the way they drape
			the flowers over the shotgun that
			makes you cry.
			We could have destroyed both
			crafts without even using our
			photon torpedoes. They were
			totally vulnerable.
			Maybe next time, Worf. Maybe next
			time.
			I wish to reinstate the same
			program.
			Maybe with some new material.
			We will continue.
			What, no warm up?
			I told a joke.
			And?
			No one laughed.
			No one? Nobody?
			Me, I'm "no one" and "nobody."
			It wasn't funny.
			She said I "killed" the joke.
			It's always hard to deal with a
			solo person. You need a crowd.
			Laughter is contagious.
			A lot of things are contagious.
			Most of them aren't funny either.
			Perhaps he is right. An audience
			could be the difference.
			Holodeck, give me an audience.
			And now folks from his record
			breaking tour of Straleb and Atlec
			I bring you the funny man of the
			stars, that comet comedian, the
			sensation of the solar system,
			... DATA!
			Good evening ladies and "germs."
			You know I come from a town so
			small it had a fraction for a zip
			code.
			... It was so small in fact that
			it didn't have a Godfather of
			Crime... it had a Nephew..
			You sure you made a living doing
			this?
			I was so ugly as a child they hung
			a pork chop around my neck so the
			dog would play with me. Then
			there was the gene bank where they
			crossed a lion and a parrot. They
			weren't sure what they got but
			when it spoke, they listened.
			Or the human cannonball that was
			hired and fired in the same night.
			Holodeck off.
			It was a Holodeck audience. They
			were programmed to laugh at
			anything...
			Never mind that. Let me tell you
			one about the traveling salesman.
			I have heard it...
			I have heard them all.
			Hold the speed, Captain Okona.
			We'll disengage at my command.
			Disengage.
			Separated.
			I'm under my own power. Thank
			you, Enterprise. Thank you,
			Captain Picard.
			I think it turned out to be "my
			pleasure," Mister Okona.
			You've got a bizarre sense of
			humor, Captain.
			Stretched to the limit with you,
			but thankfully still present.
			I think I might miss your
			presence, but I would like it to
			remain a fond memory.
			Well put Captain Picard, and
			good-bye sir.
			Good-bye Captain Okona.
			What about you Data? You can say
			good-bye, Data.
			"Good-bye Data."
			Was I funny?
			And there is the one about the
			girl in the nudist colony that
			nothing looked good on.
			Warp speed Captain?
			Please...
