			Captain's log, stardate 42609.1.
			In response to a desperate plea
			for aid by my old friend, Captain
			Donald Varley of the USS Yamato,
			I am running a grave risk and
			taking the Enterprise into the
			Neutral Zone.
			This rendezvous is necessitated
			by dangerous malfunctions which
			are plaguing our sister ship.
			Perhaps with both crews working
			together we will be able to
			eliminate the problem -- before
			we are detected by the Romulans.
			Mister Crusher -- how long to
			rendezvous?
			Four minutes, thirty-three
			seconds, sir.
			Status of download, Mister Data?
			Entire Yamato log will be in our
			computer by rendezvous.
			Have you nailed down our little
			hiccup yet?
			Sir?
			The odd reading.
			No. It might be due to the
			problems currently being
			experienced by the Yamato.
			Trouble, Number One?
			I'm not sure, sir.
			We are alone out here?
			Yes, sir. There are no other
			vessels in the area except the
			Yamato.
			Which is coming into viewer range
			now.
			Transmission from the Yamato,
			Captain -- on visual.
			Donald, what's a nice Starfleet
			Captain like you doing in a place
			like this?
			It's good to see you, Jean-Luc,
			despite your antique humor. I
			only hope your people can help
			us. The malfunctions are becoming
			serious. We lost an engineering
			team when the computer shut down
			the forcefield in an open shuttle
			bay. Eighteen people.
			And no idea what's causing these
			problems?
			None. They are affecting every
			system simultaneously. It's like
			the ship has suddenly decided to
			fall apart.
			It's beginning to make me think
			we should have run these Galaxy
			Class ships across a few more
			drawing boards before we built
			one.
			Are you suggesting it's a design
			flaw?
			I don't know. I'm grasping at
			straws here. All I know is that
			we've got to get it fixed, and
			before I lose more than an
			engineering team.
			Do you wish to evacuate
			non-essential personnel to the
			Enterprise?
			No... that would be premature.
			Donald, we'll get our teams to
			work. I'm sure neither of us
			feels too comfortable sitting
			around the Neutral Zone.
			I know what you're thinking, what
			the hell am I doing here? Well,
			I had heard rumors about a couple
			of archaeological digs that
			started making the Iconians sound
			a lot less like legend. I did
			a little investigating, and I
			located their homeworld.
			In the Neutral Zone.
			In the Neutral Zone.
			Don, this was quite a risk to
			run just to satisfy an
			archaeological curiosity.
			No, the risk would be in allowing
			the Romulans to locate Iconia.
			Fortunately, I got there first.
			It's a virtually dead planet, but
			enough of the technology remains
			to give the Romulans an edge if
			they were ever to find it.
			Don, your transmission is breaking
			up.
			Clean that up.
			Sir, there is an energy build-up
			in the Yamato's engineering
			section.
			Yamato, this is the Enterprise,
			come in Yamato.
			Magnetic seals in the antimatter
			chamber decaying!
			Captain. Don!
			Shields up!
			Sir!
			Sensors indicate no life readings
			from the Yamato's saucer section.
			Captain! Another vessel coming
			into sensor range.
			It is Romulan.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			Yamato's entire crew and their
			families, more than a thousand
			people, have been lost.
			Circumstances, unfortunately,
			permit us no pause for grief.
			No response from the Romulan
			vessel.
			Arm phasers and prepare to lock
			on target.
			Did they attack the Yamato?
			Unknown, sir.
			All their weapons systems have
			been fully activated. Still no
			response.
			Romulan vessel, this is Captain
			Picard of the USS Enterprise.
			Explain your illegal presence in
			the Neutral Zone --
			Explain yours!
			Are you responsible for the
			destruction of the Yamato?
			No. And believe me, Captain, had
			we chosen to exercise our right
			to defend the Neutral Zone, we
			would not have stopped with one
			starship. You will leave at
			once.
			Comments?
			She is extremely anxious --
			Understandable if she just
			destroyed a Federation starship.
			Your scan was inconclusive. We
			can't be sure of what happened
			to the Yamato.
			Our presence in the Neutral Zone
			is provocative. It could force
			her to respond.
			Open com. We will comply when
			we have determined the cause of
			the Yamato's destruction. And
			when we are fully satisfied that
			you were not responsible. Picard
			out.
			They are engaging their cloaking
			device.
			Good. They can't fire when
			they're cloaked.
			Unless they have overcome that
			deficiency. The Yamato was
			destroyed while they were cloaked.
			Forget the Romulans. I want to
			know what happened to the Yamato.
			Number One, assemble the staff
			for a conference in one hour.
			And I want answers.
			Aye, sir.
			Sensor recordings reveal that what
			we witnessed was an uncontrolled
			and catastrophic matter/antimatter
			mix. The magnetic seals between
			the chambers collapsed --
			That's not possible.
			Yes, sir, it is, but a highly
			improbable series of events has
			to take place before such an
			occurrence can result.
			Explain.
			In the event of a breach of seal
			integrity there is an emergency
			release system which dumps the
			antimatter.
			Apparently such a dump began, was
			then halted, and the containment
			seals were dropped. There was
			still sufficient antimatter
			present to lead to the result we
			observed.
			Then there is no evidence that
			a weapon was used?
			I'm sorry I'm late. I was with
			the children. They have been
			deeply affected by the Yamato's
			destruction.
			Mister Data.
			Evidence of a weapon? No, sir,
			none.
			However it happened, the Yamato
			did it to herself.
			Theorize. What do you think
			caused this catastrophic
			malfunction?
			I think Captain Varley may have
			been correct. There could be
			a design flaw.
			In a Galaxy Class starship?
			Yes, sir. It's the most
			complicated piece of machinery
			ever built. Something could have
			been overlooked.
			Knowing where the flaw is located,
			do you think you can isolate and
			solve the problem?
			We're working on it now.
			Pull any and all personnel who
			might be useful to your task.
			If we have established that the
			Romulans were not responsible for
			the destruction of the Yamato,
			would it not be prudent for us
			to withdraw?
			If this is a design flaw, we
			better stay where we are and
			give Geordi time to work. Or
			what happened to the Yamato
			could happen to us.
			Computer, access Captain Donald
			Varley's personal log. Search
			parameter, locate entries
			containing the words Romulan and
			Iconia.
			Working.
			Personal log. It was kind of
			Doctor Ramsey to allow me to carry
			away my own little piece of legend
			from the archaeological dig on
			Denius Three. My engineers have
			examined it, but are completely baffled
			by the technology. What was its
			purpose? I'm like a caveman
			confronted by a tricorder. I'm
			certain this device is Iconian.
			But how far had it travelled
			before it was abandoned on an
			alien world?
			Personal log. A galactic Rosetta
			stone. The starfield shown on
			the artifact was unintelligible
			until I took into account two
			hundred millenia of stellar
			drift. After that it was easy
			to pinpoint Iconia.
			My first officer is questioning
			the wisdom of my order to
			violate the Neutral Zone, but
			I am convinced I have taken the
			only proper course. Should this
			advanced technology fall into
			the hands of the Romulans, we
			might as well dock our ships
			and defend ourselves with sticks.
			Personal log. We've been spotted
			by a Romulan cruiser, but after
			playing hide and seek through
			several solar systems, I think
			I've managed to elude them.
			The Iconian probe scan -- was it
			an attempt at communication? If
			only I knew what we were dealing
			with here.
			Personal log. I am unable to send
			an away team to the surface of
			Iconia, nor can I scan the energy
			source on the planet because of
			these maddening system failures.
			It is infuriating to be stopped
			at the threshold of a dream by
			one's own ship. We are leaving
			orbit to rendezvous with Picard.
			If his people can't help us repair
			the Yamato, I must convince him
			to continue this exploration.
			The future well being of the
			Federation may depend upon it.
			No further entries conforming to
			search parameters.
			Mister Data, there is a reference
			in Captain Varley's personal log
			to a probe which scanned the
			Yamato.
			Yes, sir. We have a visual
			record.
			Put it on Main Viewer.
			What the devil is that?
			Have you ever seen anything like
			that before?
			No, sir, but it appears to be
			a scanner. Possibly a
			transmitter.
			Transmitting what?
			Unknown, sir.
			Engineering.
			La Forge.
			Progress on your matter/antimatter
			scan?
			Everything continues to check
			out. I'm starting an analysis
			of the magnetic coils.
			Data, when the Yamato was probed,
			where was she?
			In orbit around a planet at
			coordinates two two seven mark
			three five nine.
			Estimated time of arrival at warp
			factor eight?
			Twelve hours, sixteen minutes.
			Sir, that would put us
			substantially closer to the
			Romulan side of the Neutral Zone.
			It can't be helped. Ensign
			Crusher, lay in a course. Warp
			factor eight.
			We are going to assume the
			Yamato's mission.
			And risk a war?
			If that's what it takes to get
			some answers.
			Come.
			Sir, may I talk to you for a
			minute?
			Yes.
			It's about the Iconians, sir.
			I'd always heard that they were
			just a myth.
			China was thought to be only a
			myth until Marco Polo travelled
			there. No, the Iconians were
			real. We know that three
			systems in this sector have a
			number of cultural similarities.
			Similarities which can be
			explained only if there had been
			a single unifying force.
			The Iconians colonized those
			worlds?
			Probably conquered.
			So they were warlike?
			Perhaps. Ancient texts refer
			to them as the Demons of Air and
			Darkness, but that could have
			so many different interpretations.
			Air and darkness?
			Legend has it that they travelled
			without the benefit of spaceships.
			Merely appearing from thin air
			on distant planets.
			That sounds like magic.
			Wouldn't we seem magical to a
			stone-age people?
			How did you find out about all
			this?
			Archaeology has been a hobby since
			my Academy days. But why don't
			we talk about what really brought
			you here?
			I can't stop thinking about the
			Yamato. All those people -- dead.
			I just don't know how you do it.
			You, Commander Riker, Geordi, you
			all handle it so easily.
			Easily. No, not easily.
			Darjeeling tea, hot.
			We handle it because we are
			trained to, as you will be. But
			if the time ever comes when the
			death of even a single individual
			fails to move us --
			That should not have happened.
			Captain's log, supplemental. As
			happened with her sister, the
			Enterprise is being plagued by
			a series of system failures.
			So far they are random, but
			perhaps early symptoms of what
			happened to the Yamato.
			La Forge!
			Lieutenant, are you making any
			progress toward a solution to our
			problems?
			A solution, no sir, but I can
			eliminate one worry. It is not
			a design flaw. I've been
			reviewing the Yamato's log, and
			I think maybe that alien probe
			had something to do with her
			problems.
			How?
			I'd need to see the thing.
			If it was the probe, that explains
			the Yamato; but how do you account
			for the difficulties the
			Enterprise is experiencing?
			I can't.
			Are our problems likely to attain
			the seriousness experienced by
			the Yamato?
			If you want speculation, yes sir,
			I think they are. I need time.
			Lieutenant, time is the one
			thing which we do not have in
			abundance.
			Scanning.
			Mister Data.
			No life-form readings.
			All major cities have been
			heavily damaged, and the pattern
			of destruction is consistent
			with large-scale orbital
			bombardment.
			How long ago?
			Approximately two hundred
			thousand years.
			There is an energy source in the
			mountains of the smaller
			continent.
			Magnify.
			Is this Iconia?
			Donald Varley died believing that
			it was.
			Captain! Projectile launched from
			the planet's surface!
			Its size and composition match
			the probe which scanned the
			Yamato.
			Shields up. Ready the tractor
			beam. Lieutenant La Forge, I'm
			about to assist you in your
			research. A probe has been
			launched from Iconia. I intend
			to capture it.
			No, sir, wait!
			Captain! Captain!
			Damn!
			Bridge!
			Emergency stop!
			Emergency stop! Stop dammit!
			Tractor beam ready, sir.
			Prepare to lower shields,
			Mister Crusher.
			Geordi, are you --
			Destroy it, sir, quickly!
			Worf, target phasers!
			Phasers locked on target.
			Fire!
			Mister La Forge, are you all right?
			Yes, sir, and thank you for
			trusting me. If that thing had
			managed to scan us, we would have
			had no hope of saving the
			Enterprise.
			That probe was a transmitter
			sending an alien computer program.
			The same program that is currently
			aboard the Enterprise and trying
			to rewrite our software in its
			own image. We have two
			completely incompatible computer
			systems trying to interact.
			So that's why the ship's
			instruments have become so
			erratic.
			Yes.
			What can you do?
			Not very much. The Iconian
			program is so sophisticated I
			don't think I'll ever understand
			it.
			Consider, Captain, this program
			has entered an alien data base
			-- ours -- and in less than seven
			hours it has managed to not only
			learn our system, but has also
			begun to reprogram our computer.
			So the earlier probe was
			responsible for the Yamato's
			destruction.
			Only insofar as the probe
			transmitted the program.
			But we weren't scanned by the
			probe. So how did this thing
			get aboard the Enterprise?
			We downloaded the Yamato log, and
			contained in the log was the
			program.
			So why haven't we suffered their
			fate?
			The program affected all systems
			on the Yamato simultaneously.
			But with us, the program was
			deposited in a specific section
			of our mainframe. It's having
			to work its way out from that
			location. That gives us a little
			breathing space.
			Not much. Reports of injuries
			are mounting.
			Doctor Pulaski is unwilling to
			trust the turbolifts. She is
			sending medical teams through the
			access tunnels.
			Sir, the Enterprise computer
			system is a lot like our bodies
			with a voluntary and involuntary
			system. Probably ninety percent
			of what happens on this ship is
			done automatically, completely
			beyond our control. We're sitting
			on a bomb that could go any second
			-- or never.
			Can you stop this thing?
			I'll give it my best shot.
			The biobeds aren't working.
			The ship's falling apart and
			you're wasting my time about
			biobeds? I've got thirty-five
			emergency calls scattered across
			twelve decks and my trauma teams
			are being run ragged trying to
			respond.
			Biobeds!
			Doctor Pulaski.
			What?
			I've got a problem here.
			The knitter isn't working.
			Use a splint.
			Splint. It's a very ancient
			concept -- two flat pieces of wood
			or plastic, a bandage. The broken
			limb is kept immobile.
			That's crazy, that's not
			practicing medicine.
			Oh yes it is. A time-honored way
			of practicing medicine -- by
			using your head and your heart
			and your hands. So jump to it.
			Dammit!
			Try a bypass on the shield control
			interface.
			No go. Let me see if I can
			directly access the master
			program.
			What happened?
			Any answer would be mere
			speculation. This is just another
			example of how our actions have
			random results.
			Thank you, Data, I noticed.
			Life support has failed on Decks
			Seven and Thirteen.
			Suppose this thing manages to
			rewrite our entire system? It's
			so far beyond us that we don't
			have a hope of understanding it,
			much less controlling it. Our
			ignorance could kill us.
			We may never reach that point.
			A variation of what happened to
			the Yamato may destroy us first.
			So we just sit here while the ship
			disintegrates around us?
			The probe was launched from
			Iconia, probably by an automated
			system. There may be records
			near the launch site which
			could help us find a solution.
			I'll form an away team.
			I will lead it.
			You will lead it?
			Yes.
			We've had this discussion a
			hundred times before.
			Will, ever since I was a cadet
			I've studied the Iconians. I have
			to be the one to go.
			The Enterprise is yours.
			For as long as she lasts.
			I've got a fix on the energy
			source, and for the moment this
			baby...
			... is working, but that could
			change in an instant.
			We're aware of the risks.
			Energize.
			Transport complete.
			Stay sharp, Mister O'Brien, I want
			to be able to pull them out at
			a moment's notice.
			Commander, Romulan vessel!
			Open hailing frequencies.
			They're arming photon torpedoes!
			Shields up! Go to Red Alert!
			Shields not responding.
			They are preparing to fire photon
			torpedoes!
			Ensign Crusher, we need those
			shields!
			I'm trying, sir!
			Firing.
			What happened?
			Instead of firing they suddenly
			disarmed and cancelled.
			Fate protects fools, little
			children and ships called
			Enterprise.
			Lock phasers on the Romulan, but
			hold your fire.
			Sir, the shields are up.
			Impeccable timing.
			Uh, shields are back down.
			Phaser banks are down.
			The shields are back up.
			In another time and another place
			this could be funny.
			Status of the torpedo banks?
			They're down too.
			In case it should become necessary
			to fight, do you suppose you could
			find me some rocks to throw at
			them?
			Sir, the Romulan torpedoes are
			continuing to arm and disarm.
			Maybe their attempt to fire
			was not intentional.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Open.
			Romulan vessel, this is Commander
			William Riker, first officer of
			the USS Enterprise. Why did you
			attempt to fire on us?
			This is Sub-Commander Taris of
			the Haakona. Why have you
			penetrated deeper into the
			Neutral Zone?
			Why are you still here?
			I have claimed this planet for
			the Romulan Empire.
			This is the Neutral Zone. Nobody
			can claim anything.
			You will withdraw or I will be
			forced to destroy your ship and
			your away team.
			What the hell?
			This is your final warning, I
			will not --
			Having a little trouble with your
			systems, Commander? Maybe we
			could consider postponing the war
			until we solve our more immediate
			problem?
			You're stalling for time.
			Sir, another probe launched from
			the planet, heading for the
			Romulan.
			Have we got our phasers back?
			No, sir.
			Taris, if you've got phaser
			capability, you better use it now!
			What?
			Destroy that probe!
			And not even a thank you.
			Sub-Commander Taris is deeply
			frustrated, probably because her
			ship is as crippled as the
			Enterprise.
			Why would the Romulans be having
			problems? They haven't been
			probed.
			They must have tapped into the
			Yamato log. Taris got a whole
			lot more than she bargained for.
			Commander, sensors indicate the
			Romulans are attempting to
			transport a team.
			They lost them, complete
			molecular break-up.
			So the captain is safe for the
			moment.
			Safe from the Romulans.
			Maintain Red Alert, and try to
			keep those shields up just in case
			Taris feels she has to act on her
			threat.
			Sir, what about the away team?
			With our shields up we can't beam
			them back.
			Enterprise. Come in Enterprise.
			Still no response, sir.
			Keep trying them. Communication
			is going to be erratic.
			I do not want to become a
			permanent resident of this
			planet.
			Nor do I, Mister Worf.
			Scans indicate no other life-forms
			on the planet.
			I would not expect any. Judging
			from the severity of bombardment,
			I doubt any Iconians survived.
			Well, Mister Data, let us see if we
			can make sense of this.
			Aye, sir.
			This is very reminiscent of
			Dinasian.
			Yes, sir. There are also
			similarities to Dewan and Iccobar.
			Is it possible that they are all
			branches of a language family
			beginning with Iconian?
			Yes.
			Run a comparison between simple,
			basic words in Dinasian, Dewan
			and Iccobar. Let's see if we
			can't reconstruct a common root
			language.
			Accessing.
			You're jumpy.
			The tension on the ship is very
			high.
			What's your recommendation?
			Give everyone something else to
			think about, some place to focus
			their attention.
			All right, let's consider
			evacuation.
			To the planet?
			It's risky with Taris sitting
			out there -- it's probably
			impossible to pull off, but it
			will give everyone something
			to do. You go and start
			organizing it.
			But you will need me if you
			have to negotiate with Taris
			again.
			I'll manage. Right now
			they're more important.
			Captain, your original hypothesis
			was correct. Iconian is the
			parent tongue for a language
			family consisting of Dewan,
			Iccobar and Dinasian. I have
			constructed a basic working
			understanding through a comparison
			of common root words such as
			mother, father, food, death,
			child, home, tribe, pain, love,
			mine, yours, ours --
			Data, Data, Data -- the point.
			You do understand that my
			interpretation of the symbols will
			not be exact?
			Yes, let's get on with it.
			This would appear to be the manual
			override.
			That was not manual override.
			Demons of Air and Darkness,
			indeed.
			What is that?
			A gateway.
			The scenes could be holographic
			images.
			Data, that was very foolish.
			But we have established it is
			not a holograph. If I step
			through and investigate, we would
			determine whether it is truly a
			gateway.
			No, Data. You might not be able
			to get back, and I can't risk
			losing you.
			If it's not illusion, this gate
			would seem to take you beyond the
			confines of this planet.
			Is this how the Iconians
			travelled? Stepping across light
			years as easily as we would cross
			a room? Those worlds might be
			in distant sectors of our galaxy.
			This is what Varley feared. What
			he lost his life for.
			Sir?
			The Romulans could turn this
			technology into a weapon.
			Like the Iconians did.
			No, I believe that to be
			incorrect. Captain, there is
			nothing in this room to indicate
			it was used as a military command
			center. It is much more akin to
			a transporter room.
			But the probe was hostile.
			We can't make that assumption.
			The probe's effect on the Yamato
			was devastating, but I suspect
			that was by accident rather than
			design.
			We do know that the Iconians were
			conquerors.
			Do we? The little we know was
			passed down by the descendants
			of the people who attacked this
			world. I'm beginning to think
			the Iconians may have been the
			victims of some very bad press.
			Sir?
			There's an unfortunate tendency
			in most cultures to fear what they
			don't understand. It is possible
			that their enemies, when confronted
			with this technology, were driven
			to attack the Iconians out of
			fear.
			Sir!
			Was that really the Enterprise?
			I believe that it was. Gentlemen,
			we have a way home.
			I think the Iconians might have
			outfoxed their enemies. Perhaps
			they didn't all die in the
			bombardment; some may have passed
			through this.
			Sir, there is a vast underground
			power source which is controlled
			by this console.
			My triggering of the gateway has
			caused a dramatic upsurge in power
			levels.
			Ah, I have access.
			Sir, the Enterprise again.
			Time the rotation.
			Data, respond.
			Captain.
			Are you all right?
			No, I am damaged.
			How bad is it?
			The Iconian program is attempting
			a rewrite of my basic software.
			Physical manifestations --
			Sir, without him we have no hope
			of deciphering the program.
			How long until the Enterprise
			reappears?
			Six minutes if the cycle holds.
			Stand ready, Mister Worf, and go
			through with Data. Geordi can
			learn from him. Maybe help him.
			Sir, we have not yet established
			that that...
			... is truly a gateway.
			This will be the test.
			Aye, sir.
			Data, give me your tricorder.
			Sir, what is your present
			location?
			I'm right in front of you... Data,
			what is it?
			Please, take the tricorder. I
			am unable to sufficiently pinpoint
			your location to be able to hand
			it to you.
			You're blind.
			Yes, sir.
			Destroy this.
			But, sir, it contains the record
			of all that we have discovered
			here.
			And that is precisely why it must
			be destroyed. Time?
			Three minutes.
			I am running out of time. We
			all are.
			This room and the technology
			contained in it must be destroyed.
			It cannot be allowed to fall into
			Romulan hands.
			I understand...
			How! How do I do it? How can
			I destroy everything? Control
			room, the probes? All of it.
			The... power... source.
			I detonate it?
			Yes.
			How? What do I do?
			The... probes.
			Probes... the probes. Launch?
			Do I launch the probes?
			What's that going to do? Nothing.
			Doors.
			Doors?
			Perhaps the probes are in a
			launch bay.
			The doors will open automatically
			when the launch begins. I'd have
			to override.
			Yes.
			The power source! The backwash
			from the rockets will spill into
			the main power grids and cause
			an overload.
			Cor... rect.
			Which control keys? Damn, I
			forgot you can't see.
			Help.
			Describe.
			We're directly opposite the
			gateway. There is a rectangular
			screen.
			Left... one meter.
			Triangular screen. The lights
			directly above are solid amber.
			To the left red --
			Cor... rect. Key... blue,
			amber... amber... red.
			That's the launch sequence?
			How do I override the doors?
			Blue, blue, blue.
			I hope you're not stuttering.
			I don't know how long a delay
			there will be between the launch
			and the detonation. I'll hold
			off keying the launch sequence
			until you're through the gate.
			How long until the Enterprise
			returns?
			Almost time, sir. Captain, you
			will be killed.
			I'll go through the gate.
			But where will you end up?
			Any place is going to be better
			than this room. Worf, I'm
			depending on you. Get Data back
			to the Enterprise. He may be
			their last hope.
			Worf! What happened? Where's
			the captain?
			We must take Data to Engineering.
			I don't know how to help him.
			But comparing recorded norms for
			Data to the current readings, it's
			clear that all his functions are
			going crazy. If we had an expert
			-- Maddox, or somebody --
			He's gone.
			Data!
			What the hell?
			Ah, I have access.
			The self-correcting mechanism --
			Captain? Captain?
			It's constantly kicking in to make
			minute adjustments in the
			positronic brain.
			This is the Enterprise. How did
			I get here?
			He cleared the Iconian program
			from his own system. How?
			Iconia? I was on Iconia. Now
			I am on the Enterprise.
			Geordi, this is critical. How?
			Let me think for a second. There
			was an incompatible program
			running through Data's system, so
			the mechanism started searching
			for a way to keep him alive. The
			solution must have been a shutdown
			and a total wipe of all affected
			memory.
			Query. What have I forgotten?
			One question. Can we do the same
			thing with the Enterprise?
			I don't see why not... but it will
			have to be a complete shutdown.
			We turn her off, effect a wipe
			of the Yamato log and every
			subsequent event since we
			downloaded it. I'll then reload
			all the ship's programs from the
			protected archives in the main
			core.
			Geordi, a shutdown means that the
			shields are going to be coming
			down too, and we're hanging nose
			to nose with a Romulan battle
			cruiser.
			Hey, Commander, whether it's
			Romulan phasers or our own
			warp engines we're just as dead.
			Make it so.
			Can I help?
			Kandar more, kandar sete, kandar
			ne.
			All systems functioning.
			Lock on the captain and bring him
			back.
			Scanning, sir. Got him.
			Kandar qetar, Kandar jet, kandar
			piqe, kandar...
			Setha-tri par trukatha.
			I've lost him!
			Damn it!
			Got him! Sir! He's on the
			Romulan ship.
			How the hell... never mind.
			Energize!
			You did this.
			Setha-ki par trukatha.
			Did what?
			Activated the auto-destruct. I
			at least have the satisfaction
			that you will die with us.
			Setha-mille par trukatha.
			Not I think, today, Commander.
			Bridge.
			Yes, sir.
			Get us out of here. The Romulan
			ship is set for auto-destruct and
			they can't deactivate it.
			Wait, sir.
			Open a hailing frequency.
			Open, sir.
			Commander Taris, prepare to
			receive a transmission from our
			chief engineer. He'll instruct
			you on how to purge your system.
			Commander, your transmission has
			been received and acknowledged.
			Now, Mister Data, warp speed please
			-- just in case Taris's engineer
			is not as efficient as Lieutenant
			La Forge.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain, sensors picking up a
			large explosion on the surface
			of Iconia. It is equivalent to
			a force twelve hydrogen explosion.
			Blast radius is nine hundred
			kilometers.
			The dust particles entering the
			stratosphere will take an
			estimated seven months to fall
			back to the surface. The
			diminution in sunlight will have
			the effect of lowering average
			daily surface temperatures on
			Iconia by fifteen degrees
			Celsius.
			I see Data's back to normal.
			With a little touch of amnesia.
			It seems that everything is back
			to normal. Well done, Commander.
			Thank you, sir.
