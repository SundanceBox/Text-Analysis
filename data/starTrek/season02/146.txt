			Lookin' good. I say... five.
			Five here.
			And five more.
			I believe the wiser course of
			action here is to bend.
			You mean fold.
			That is correct. Fold -- to bend,
			make compact or give in.
			I raise fifty.
			I do not believe Lieutenant Worf
			understands all the nuances of
			this betting procedure.
			Don't be too quick to judge, Data.
			His pile's a lot bigger than
			yours.
			Than all of ours.
			The cards have been favoring the
			Lieutenant, but that is the result
			of random chance... hence it is
			a temporary condition.
			You hope.
			Talk or play. Not both.
			Fifty, right?
			Fifty is the bet. What's the
			matter -- are your feet getting
			cold?
			No, just my cards...
			Thanks for staying in -- I need
			the chips.
			Got to earn them first.
			Oh, I will. This pot has my name
			on it.
			Talk, talk, talk...
			Here's some action. Fifty...
			... and another fifty.
			Fold, fold, fold...
			Your fifty, and fifty more.
			Love to stay in -- but not with
			these cards.
			Looks like it's just you and me,
			handsome.
			I'll see you.
			Beats my straight.
			The Iceman wins again.
			You took my last chip. You could
			at least smile, Worf.
			Smiling might break his
			concentration.
			If you don't enjoy winning -- what
			do you enjoy? Losing?
			We'd be happy to accommodate you.
			Your deal.
			The game is seven card stud; after
			the queen, one-eyed jacks and low
			card in the hole are wild.
			Let me write this down.
			Just deal. I'd like to get some
			of my losings back before the next
			century.
			I open with fifty.
			Bridge to Commander Riker. We
			are receiving a class eleven
			emergency signal from Starfleet
			Command.
			On my way.
			Fifty? You were bluffing.
			Klingons never bluff.
			Mister Data?
			Emergency signal reads as follows:
			Enterprise to divert to
			coordinates four-two-three by
			one-one-two by five-one
			immediately. Further orders
			forthcoming.
			That's it? What's the emergency?
			The message does not elaborate.
			You'd think they'd at least give
			us a hint.
			Course laid in, Captain.
			Warp eight.
			Whenever Starfleet gets enigmatic,
			I know we're about to face a
			challenge.
			Engage.
			Our destination is a point near
			the Boradis system.
			That area was colonized fairly
			recently, as I recall.
			The first Federation outpost was
			established thirty-four years ago
			on Boradis Three.
			And since then, the Federation
			has colonized several planets in
			that sector.
			Yet we are not headed for a
			specific colony. The coordinates
			given are outside the Boradis
			system.
			Any problems reported in that
			area?
			None.
			Then what the devil's going on?
			Captain, Starfleet Command is
			hailing us.
			It's about time. On screen.
			Greetings, Captain Picard.
			My compliments, Admiral Gromek.
			Captain, you'll soon be joined
			by a Federation special emissary
			from Starbase one five three.
			We're now transmitting the
			specifics.
			We are receiving.
			The rendezvous will be a bit
			tricky, so it's imperative you
			reach the intercept point on
			schedule.
			Understood. And -- the mission?
			The envoy will fill you in. You
			are to cooperate fully.
			Can you give me any details?
			Negative.
			Admiral, I find it difficult to
			prepare for a mission I know
			nothing about.
			I sympathize, Jean-Luc, but
			Starfleet Command considers this
			a top-security matter.
			After the envoy's briefed you,
			I think you'll understand our
			caution. Gromek out.
			Data, what ship is carrying the
			envoy?
			The envoy is not aboard a
			starship.
			Indeed?
			Apparently there were no starships
			available at Starbase
			one five three. The emissary is
			aboard a class eight probe.
			A class eight probe is just over
			two meters long!
			True, Number One. But if the
			sensors and transmitters were
			removed and life-support
			installed, there would be just
			enough space for one person.
			And those probes are designed to
			go warp nine.
			By sending the probe to meet us
			rather than diverting the
			Enterprise to the starbase, they
			have saved us six point one hours.
			Obviously Starfleet feels that
			time is of the essence.
			Yes, but still... to seal someone
			up inside a Class Eight Probe and
			then just launch it off...
			Hell of a way to transport a
			Federation dignitary.
			We'll need an intercept course
			with pin-point accuracy. The
			probe carrying the emissary has
			no means of navigation...
			... so if we don't catch it on the
			first try, we'll have to chase
			it.
			Data -- if we project our course
			past the rendezvous coordinates,
			what lies ahead?
			As far as I can determine, sir
			-- very little. There are four
			colonies in the Boradis system,
			and nine other outposts scattered
			throughout the sector.
			Captain, we have a way to save
			you some time.
			Proceed.
			I believe we can beam the probe
			aboard while we're still
			travelling at Warp Nine.
			Quite a trick.
			Right -- at warp speed it's
			nearly impossible to get a solid
			transporter lock. But if we
			caught the probe with a tractor
			beam...
			We could use the tractor beam to
			focus the transporter.
			Exactly.
			Risks?
			None to the emissary. There's
			a chance the probe could break
			free... then we'd have to find
			it and start over.
			So it's a gamble.
			Odds, gentlemen?
			Twenty to one it'll work.
			Make it so.
			Coming to three-one mark one-one-three.
			We should now be on a precisely
			parallel course with the probe.
			Increase to warp eight point nine.
			Eight point nine -- aye.
			Full sensors, aft.
			Scanning...
			I have it, sir. Bearing zero-five
			mark two-three-one; velocity warp
			nine.
			I see it.
			Adjust speed to intercept.
			Probe coming up to starboard,
			range eighty-two hundred.
			Tractor beam ready.
			Mister La Forge?
			Transporter ready, Captain.
			Range now seventy-five hundred.
			Steady as she goes...
			Probe is standing abeam.
			Engage tractor.
			Okay, O'Brien, they've hooked
			it -- let's reel it in.
			Will do.
			Transporter beam locked, Captain.
			Energize.
			Probe aboard, Captain.
			Acknowledged. Number One?
			I'll welcome our visitor.
			Resume original course and speed.
			Aye, sir.
			Well done, everyone.
			Something wrong, Doctor?
			I'm not sure. The readings are
			quite... interesting.
			I greet you. I am K'Ehleyr.
			nuqneH. qaleghneS.
			You speak Klingon.
			A little. I am Commander Riker,
			and this is our chief medical
			officer, Katherine Pulaski.
			I hope your voyage wasn't too
			unpleasant.
			Klingons are not supposed to mind
			hardship.
			Nonetheless -- I'm delighted to
			be out of that damned coffin.
			I don't blame you.
			Not the most luxurious
			accommodations Starfleet has to
			offer...
			Whoever said that getting there
			is half the fun never rode in
			a class eight probe.
			How are you feeling? Your vital
			signs are rather atypical for a
			Klingon.
			No doubt because I am only half
			Klingon.
			Oh?
			Yes. My father was Klingon; my
			mother was human.
			Captain, I'd like to present
			Special Federation Emissary
			K'Ehleyr.
			Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			Counselor Troi, Lieutenant
			Commander Data, and --
			Worf! So this is where you've
			been hiding. I told you we'd meet
			again!
			Aren't you going to greet me?
			I have nothing to say to you.
			Haven't changed a bit, eh? Well,
			I missed you, too.
			Two days ago, Starbase three three six
			received an automated
			transmission from a Klingon ship,
			the T'Ong.
			That ship was sent out over
			seventy-five years ago.
			When the Federation and the
			Klingon Empire were still at
			war...
			The message was directed to the
			Klingon High Command. It said
			only that the T'Ong was returning
			home and was about to reach the
			"awakening point."
			Which suggests that the crew was
			in cryogenic sleep for most of
			the long voyage.
			Exactly.
			And when the crew is revived...
			... we'll have a ship full of
			Klingons who think the war is
			still going on.
			So our task is to find the ship,
			and tell the Klingons we are no
			longer at war.
			Why us? A Klingon ship would have
			been a better choice.
			A Klingon ship -- the P'rang --
			is on its way, but it's two days
			behind us. That may be too late.
			Why too late?
			Because the T'Ong's crew is about
			to awaken within striking range
			of a dozen Federation outposts.
			There are thirteen colonies
			with minimal defenses in that
			sector...
			Nice ripe targets for a Klingon
			warship.
			And you believe you can convince
			these Klingons that humans are
			now their allies?
			No. Not a chance.
			If you ask me, talking will be
			a waste of time. Klingons of that
			era were raised to despise humans.
			We'll try diplomacy. But I
			promise you -- it won't work.
			And then you'll have to destroy
			them.
			No.
			No? Captain, these Klingons are
			killers. You'll have no choice.
			Find me another choice. I want
			some options -- and I want them
			before we encounter the Klingon
			ship.
			Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to
			help the emissary. Dismissed.
			I'll escort you to the guest
			quarters.
			Lieutenant?
			Sir... I suggest Commander Riker
			or Data would better serve Special
			Emissary K'Ehleyr.
			Are there personal reasons you
			don't want the assignment?
			Yes.
			Any professional reasons?
			No.
			I withdraw my request, Captain.
			Good.
			I didn't know it was possible
			for a human and a Klingon to
			produce a child.
			Actually, the DNA is compatible
			-- with a fair amount of help.
			Rather like my parents.
			I know exactly what you mean.
			My father was human... and my
			mother was Betazoid.
			Really! It was the other way
			around for me -- my mother was
			human.
			You must've grown up like I did
			-- trapped between cultures.
			I never felt trapped -- I felt
			fortunate. I experienced the
			richness and diversity of two
			worlds.
			Perhaps you got the best of
			each...
			Myself, I think I got the worst
			of each.
			I doubt that.
			Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense
			of humor is bad enough -- it's
			gotten me into plenty of trouble.
			And your Klingon side?
			That, I keep under tight control.
			It's like a terrible temper --
			it's not something I want people
			to see.
			Why hide it? We all have
			tempers...
			Not like mine. Sometimes I feel
			there's a monster inside me,
			fighting to get out.
			And that frightens you.
			Of course it does. My Klingon
			side can be terrifying... even
			to me.
			Yet it gives you strength. It's
			part of you.
			That doesn't mean I have to like
			it.
			You are late.
			Sorry. Had to make myself
			beautiful.
			I fail to understand why.
			Worf, we're alone now. You don't
			have to act like a Klingon
			glacier. I don't bite...
			... well, that's wrong; I do bite.
			Shall we proceed with our assigned
			duties?
			I haven't even had a proper
			welcome.
			I would prefer to keep this
			professional.
			"I fail to understand why."
			And I feel no need to explain.
			Oh, go ahead. Tell me. It's
			because you find me irresistible,
			isn't it? You always have.
			Did you come on board the
			Enterprise to work, or to discuss
			your pointless fantasies?
			You just won't open up, will you?
			Come on -- what happened to the
			Worf I met on Samrin's Planet?
			He became a Starfleet lieutenant.
			Oh, is that it? Starfleet Academy
			turned you into a robot? You
			won't make me believe that.
			I have no wish to make you believe
			anything.
			Perhaps you have changed. You
			weren't this aloof six years
			ago... or don't you remember?
			There is nothing wrong with my
			memory.
			Well, there's something wrong with
			the rest of you. You're not even
			looking at me.
			I am familiar with your
			appearance.
			And it gives you no pleasure to
			see me again?
			It isn't as if we tried it and
			it didn't work, you know. You
			never gave it a chance.
			I never?
			I mean, as I see it, we have
			some... unfinished business, you
			and I.
			Not as far as I'm concerned.
			According to the library computer,
			the captain of the T'Ong is
			K'Temoc. But there is nothing
			regarding the ship's mission.
			So?
			You're not interested in why the
			ship was sent out?
			Probably some secret military
			objective.
			Perhaps, but we have no evidence
			of that --
			Why else would there be no record
			of the mission?
			The records may simply have been
			lost.
			In any case, what does it matter?
			Our concern is the present -- the
			possible threat.
			And to contend with that threat,
			we need information.
			We have all the information we
			need.
			That is foolish. Knowing their
			mission might help us understand
			them --
			There's nothing to understand!
			They're Klingons! They'll attack!
			In their minds, we're the enemy
			-- and there's no way we're going
			to talk them out of that!
			I do not appreciate being
			interrupted.
			And I don't appreciate wasting
			my time.
			We were instructed to come up with
			options --
			There aren't any! The
			assignment's hopeless!
			There are always options.
			Oh, are there? Tell me: whatever
			happened to that wonderful
			Klingon fatalism of yours?
			My experience aboard this ship
			has taught me that most problems
			have more than one solution.
			Starfleet hasn't improved you
			one bit. You're as stubborn as
			ever!
			Are you going to carry out your
			duties or aren't you?
			All right! I will!
			Upon due consideration of the
			problem and careful examination
			of all possible "options" -- my
			original recommendation stands.
			Meeting adjourned.
			Come.
			You're upset.
			Really! Your finely-honed
			Betazoid sense tells you that?
			Well -- that, and the table.
			I warned you about my Klingon
			half.
			May I make a suggestion?
			I thank you, Counselor. But I
			don't want any counseling.
			Actually, I was going to suggest
			something else.
			Oh?
			I find the Holodeck exercise
			programs rigorous enough to put
			my mind off most frustrations.
			And it'll keep me from wrecking
			the ship.
			That, too...
			Enter program.
			Show me the exercise menu.
			Calisthenics program of Lieutenant
			Worf.
			Program complete. You may enter
			when ready.
			Status.
			Based on the last assumed position
			of the Klingon vessel, its
			apparent trajectory, and our
			estimates of their cruising speed,
			we should be in scanner range in
			fifteen hours, eight minutes.
			Lieutenant?
			Special Emissary K'Ehleyr has...
			declared a short recess, sir.
			I wish to run a full diagnostic
			test on all tactical back-up
			equipment.
			We just ran a full test of those
			systems.
			I feel it necessary to check them
			again.
			Lieutenant, I commend your
			diligence. However, I'm concerned
			that you're working yourself too
			hard.
			Sir, considering the unknown
			elements we are about to face --
			Lieutenant -- I order you to
			relax.
			I am relaxed.
			Yes, sir.
			I've never seen the Lieutenant
			so... unsettled.
			The Iceman's finally melting.
			It's not much of a program.
			Computer. Level Two.
			Some calisthenics programs are
			better than others.
			You can still make jokes?
			Of course I can. I still have
			enough energy for that...
			You're not laughing.
			You are most observant.
			You don't like people with a sense
			of humor?
			I did not say that.
			Worf, you're the perfect Klingon
			-- the ultimate minimalist. Talk
			to me!
			I've noted that some people use
			humor as a shield... they talk
			much yet say little.
			Whereas others take a simpler
			approach -- say nothing.
			When one does not have the
			words...
			Or is loath to speak them...
			Fortunately, there are other ways
			to communicate.
			Why didn't we do this six years
			ago?
			We were not ready.
			I was...
			We were both too young -- too
			unaware. We lacked commitment.
			Perhaps we lacked courage as well.
			No longer.
			tlhIngan jIH.
			Wait. You can't mean -- You're
			not --
			We have mated.
			Yes, I know -- I was there.
			But...
			And now we must solemnize our
			union with the oath --
			Like hell we must!
			-- and pledge that we are one
			forever.
			I'm not going to become your
			wife...
			You already are.
			Don't give me that Klingon
			nonsense.
			You would dishonor our sacred
			traditions?
			They're not sacred -- they're
			absurd! Marrying you is out of
			the question for a million
			reasons...
			None of which stopped you earlier.
			Worf, it was what it was!
			Glorious and wonderful and all
			that, but it doesn't mean
			anything.
			That is a human attitude.
			I am human!
			You are also Klingon!
			And that means we should bond for
			life?
			It is our way!
			Yours -- not mine!
			tlhIngan jIH!
			I will not take the oath!
			Then this night had no meaning!
			And that, I will not believe.
			Believe what you will...
			Exit.
			Approaching the coordinates.
			Slow to impulse.
			Short and long-range sensor scans
			negative, Captain.
			Lay in a standard search pattern.
			Search pattern laid in.
			Full impulse. Engage.
			I just hope we find them before
			they come out of their nap.
			Agreed. No outpost in this sector
			could defend itself against a
			Klingon warship.
			I've been working on our
			assignment... trying a few
			computer simulations.
			Your devotion to duty is
			commendable... if belated.
			So far, I'm having no success.
			I could use some help.
			I am here to assist you.
			Unwilling to be alone with me?
			I've asked Lieutenant Commander Data to 
			help us analyze the alternatives.
			An android chaperone?
			"Android" is, of course, correct,
			but I fail to see how "chaperone"
			is applicable in this situation...
			Never mind. Come on in.
			I guess I can't blame you.
			Tell me one thing.
			You would have gone through with
			the oath, wouldn't you?
			Regardless of the consequences
			to our careers -- to our lives?
			Honor demanded no less.
			I'm sick to death of Klingon
			"honor." What do you want? Is
			honor all you care about? Don't
			you feel anything else?
			No comment, huh?
			Poor android. Which behavior do
			you find more perplexing -- human
			or Klingon?
			At the moment, I would be hard
			pressed to choose.
			So would I.
			Okay. When we locate the T'Ong,
			there are two possibilities.
			First --
			-- we find the ship before it
			reaches the "awakening point."
			In that case, we could simply keep
			the crew asleep.
			Is that feasible?
			We can beam an away team onto the
			T'Ong and override the cryogenic
			controls.
			Then we await the arrival of the
			Klingon ship P'rang...
			... so that when the T'Ong's crew
			awakens, they're surrounded by
			their fellow Klingons.
			That would be ideal.
			But there's the second
			possibility... that the crew of
			the T'Ong has already revived.
			They discover they're in
			Federation territory -- and they
			attack the nearest outpost.
			Are we sure they'll attack?
			We don't even know what the
			T'Ong's mission was.
			It may have been a scientific
			voyage.
			Klingons of that period -- doing
			research for its own sake?
			The point is, they may not be
			warlike.
			The point is that this is beside
			the point. These are Klingons...
			at war with us. Whatever their
			mission was -- once they see a
			Federation target, they'll attack.
			Could the T'Ong be disabled rather
			than destroyed?
			We could probably knock out their
			warp engines without damaging the
			rest of their ship...
			That would gain you nothing.
			Disable the ship, and K'Temoc will
			destroy it himself.
			Klingons do not surrender.
			Face it -- if we don't reach the
			T'Ong before its crew wakes up,
			you have no alternatives.
			I will not accept that. There
			must be a way to make the Klingons
			listen. If we can only convince
			them --
			Captain, we have detected a ship,
			bearing three-one-six mark
			forty-two, extreme sensor range.
			Plot an intercept course. And
			go to Yellow Alert.
			Shields are up.
			Better lock on phasers. This may
			be the only chance you get.
			Intercept course laid in.
			Hold this position. Let's see
			if they've spotted us.
			Magnification one hundred.
			Mister Data?
			Sensors show lifeforms aboard,
			sir, but I am unable to ascertain
			if they are awake or dormant.
			However, the vessel's propulsion
			systems are inactive, so I would
			hypothesize that the crew is
			asleep --
			However, I could be in error.
			Shields holding.
			They've cloaked themselves.
			Well, Captain -- you had your
			chance.
			Transfer Engineering to bridge.
			Can you find them?
			I think so. Those old shields
			weren't a hundred percent
			efficient at blocking gamma-ray
			output. If I can tune the sensors
			to a particular band of...
			There! Got 'em! Transferring
			coordinates to helm...
			Intercept. Warp two.
			Warp two, sir.
			Captain -- let them die like
			Klingons... in battle. They
			deserve that much.
			Captain... I have another option.
			The T'Ong has changed course to
			three-two mark eight-one. They
			are increasing to warp three.
			Standard evasive maneuver.
			Helm -- stay with them.
			Yes, sir.
			The T'Ong is now on a heading of
			four-one mark one-one-three...
			accelerating to warp five.
			They're making a break for it.
			Overtake. Warp eight.
			Aye.
			Put us right in their path and
			come to a full stop.
			Full power to shields.
			Full power, sir.
			We've thrown down the gauntlet...
			let's see if they pick it up.
			They are slowing to impulse --
			Phaser hit on forward shields.
			No damage.
			The T'Ong is attempting to flank
			us.
			Compensate.
			Photon torpedo hit. Shield number
			two weakened... firming up now...
			No damage.
			I think we've piqued their
			curiosity by now...
			Agreed. Let's give them the
			chance to look their enemy in the
			face.
			Ready, Lieutenant?
			Open a hailing frequency.
			Hailing frequency open, sir.
			What --
			Captain K'Temoc -- have you lost
			your mind? Halt your ship and
			drop your shields.
			What treachery is this? By whose
			authority?
			I am Worf, commanding the
			Enterprise. It is you who have
			committed an act of treason --
			by firing upon this ship.
			I have standing orders to fire
			on all Federation ships. We are
			at war.
			You fool. Did it not occur to
			you that the war would be over
			by now?
			I have no proof of that.
			Trust your eyes! Or is your brain
			still stuck in its long slumber?
			How can I be sure this is not a
			Federation trick?
			Captain, as you are new to this
			century, I have tried to be
			patient. But I will tolerate no
			further insubordination. Drop
			your shields immediately.
			And if I refuse?
			Then die in ignorance. I can
			waste no more time on you.
			Phasers to full power.
			Aye, sir.
			Phasers ready. Target locked.
			You dare not destroy us. We have
			been on a crucial mission by order
			of the Klingon High Command...
			Has the T'Ong dropped its shields?
			No, sir.
			Very well. Fire all phasers --
			Wait!
			Lower the shields.
			I yield command of the T'Ong to
			you, Captain Worf. Long live the
			Klingon Empire.
			A wise decision, Captain.
			Commander K'Ehleyr will board your
			ship and take command. The
			Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon
			arrive and escort you home.
			And, Captain --
			Yes?
			Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.
			I return command of the ship to
			you, Captain.
			Thank you and congratulations,
			Lieutenant. A very fine first
			command. Well done.
			That's all, Worf? Just a nod?
			How did you like command?
			Comfortable chair.
			One to beam aboard the T'Ong.
			All set.
			I relieve you.
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			The Klingon vessel P'rang will
			rendezvous with you in three days.
			In the meantime, I'll begin the
			assimilation of these Klingons
			to our era.
			Is there anything else you
			require?
			No. Nothing else.
			Damn you, Worf. You'd let me go
			without saying another word,
			wouldn't you?
			What needs to be said?
			Nothing. Everything. We're about
			to go our separate ways again.
			And that disturbs you?
			Yes, it does.
			I hid the truth from you. Last
			night did have meaning.
			I was tempted to take the oath
			with you. That scared me. I've
			never had such strong feelings
			toward anyone.
			Nor have I.
			Then it was more than just a point
			of honor.
			Maybe someday, when our paths
			cross again, I won't be as easy
			to get rid of.
			K'Ehleyr... I will not be complete
			without you.
