			Captain's log, Stardate 42823.2.
			My meeting with Admiral James
			Moore has offered me an
			interesting proposal. We have
			completed our repairs, and are
			preparing to warp out.
			Yes, sir?
			Recognize that?
			No, sir, I'm sorry, I don't.
			It's an old style Terran distress
			beacon. It kicked in last month,
			and was detected by the starbase.
			What's its origin point?
			The Ficus quadrant.
			Captain, there are no records of
			an Earth colony in that area.
			Admiral Moore has offered us the
			task of investigating the signal.
			And of course we've accepted.
			Am I so transparent?
			You've got that look in your eye.
			Oh?
			The lure of a mystery.
			A lost Earth colony. That is an
			exciting idea.
			They may not have survived.
			They're calling for help, aren't
			they?
			You're an optimist.
			Always.
			Signal analysis complete.
			Distress beacon used by the
			European Hegemony.
			The European Hegemony?
			A loose alliance that formed in
			the early twenty-second century. It was
			the first step toward a world
			government. You should read more
			history, Number One. Computer,
			bracket exact dates when this
			beacon was in general use.
			Old Earth calendar, 2123 until
			2190.
			No extraterrestrial source has
			ever used this beacon?
			Negative.
			Locate all Earth deep space
			launches from 2123 until 2190,
			and list their destinations.
			Working.
			Nothing for the Ficus quadrant.
			Damn it, who's out there?
			Guess we'll have to wait and ask
			them.
			How could a spaceship leave Earth
			without some kind of a record?
			Perhaps it was deliberate. They
			may have wished to escape
			detection.
			You're suggesting they were
			fugitives?
			During the Eugenics Wars a group
			of genetically superior humans
			ruled the world. After their
			defeat some did escape.
			What do you think, Worf. Can we
			handle supermen?
			Medical emergency! Doctor Pulaski
			to the bridge.
			I am fine.
			You are not fine, you fainted.
			I did not faint. Klingons do not
			faint.
			Excuse me, I'll rephrase. This
			Klingon suffered a dramatic drop
			in blood pressure, his blood
			glucose level dropped, there was
			deficient blood flow resulting
			from perpheral circulatory
			failure, in other words he curled
			up his toes and laid unconscious
			on the floor.
			Doctor, there is no need to insult
			me.
			Worf, I'm worried. Something's
			wrong. Klingons don't faint --
			forgive me, but I can't think of
			another word which applies --
			for no reason. You're sick.
			Klingons don't get sick.
			They sure do get stupid. Stay
			there! I need to check something
			with the computer.
			Lieutenant, you've got rop'ngor.
			Doctor, no one must learn that
			I am suffering from a childhood
			ailment!
			I have to file a report.
			But it is so humiliating!
			Captain Picard.
			Ah, Doctor, how is Worf?
			He's in no danger. Worf was
			observing a Klingon ritual
			involving fasting, and he didn't
			take into account that you need
			to decrease physical activity as
			you decrease caloric intake.
			Pulaski out.
			Come.
			Sir, there is a discrepancy
			between our requisition order
			for display panels and the number
			actually tendered by the
			starbase.
			How can something so simple
			become so complicated?
			Such is the nature of a
			bureaucracy?
			There's more than one way to skin
			a bureaucratic cat.
			Sir?
			There's no record of a launch to
			the Ficus quadrant. Not unusual
			if you consider the chaos of the
			early twenty-second century, but someone
			had to load that ship.
			Ah, yes, the manifest.
			There it is. The Mariposa, launch
			date November 27, 2123. Captain
			Walter Granger, commanding.
			Mariposa is the Spanish word for
			butterfly.
			Thank you, Data.
			I thought it might be significant.
			It doesn't appear to be. Ah...
			and here is the cargo list.
			You can tell a lot about people
			from their luggage. Let's see,
			two hundred and twenty five
			Yoshimitsu computers, five
			monitor beacon satellites, seven
			hundred cellular commlinks, fifty
			spinning wheels --
			Spinning wheels? Accessing. A
			device for spinning yarn or thread
			that consists of a large foot or
			hand driven wheel and one spindle.
			Cattle, chickens, pigs. . . . not
			DNA, the actual livestock.
			Incredible. Why would anyone
			carry such an insane mix of cargo?
			Spindle -- a thin rounded tapering
			rod --
			Data!
			Perhaps they were planning for
			the worst.
			In the early twenty-second century
			Earth was recovering from World
			War III. A major philosopher
			of the period was Liam Dieghan,
			the founder of the
			Neo-Transcendentalists. He
			advocated a return to a simpler
			life in which one lived in harmony
			with nature, and learned under
			her gentle tutelage --
			Thank you, Data. But if this was
			a ship full of utopians, why
			carry the technological baggage?
			Sir, I have insufficient
			information from which to form
			a cogent theory.
			I hate a mystery.
			But, sir what about Dixon Hill,
			and your penchant for detective
			fiction --
			Allow me to correct myself. I
			hate a mystery I cannot solve.
			I wished to thank you for
			protecting my --
			Your secret is safe with me.
			Worf, I'm honored. No one has
			ever made the Tea for me.
			You know the ceremony?
			I understand the externals. Not
			the mysteries. I'm not a
			Klingon.
			You must not drink the tea. It
			is deadly to humans.
			And none too good for Klingons.
			It is a test of bravery, of one's
			ability to look at the face of
			mortality. It is also a reminder
			that death is an experience best
			shared -- like the tea.
			Worf, you're a romantic.
			It is among the Klingons that
			love poetry achieves its fullest
			flower.
			Hold that thought.
			Antidote. If we're going to
			share, let's share. Now, quote
			me a little of that poetry.
			Scans indicate human life form
			readings thirty meters below the
			planet's surface.
			Hailing on all frequencies,
			Captain. So far no response.
			There is no evidence of an
			advanced communication network.
			But the comlinks?
			There is no artifical power
			source on the planet.
			But they've got a monitoring
			satellite.
			A good thing, too. Without it
			we would never have known they
			needed help.
			Captain, the stellar flares are
			increasing in intensity and
			frequency. Computer projections
			indicate they will envelope the
			planet in three point six hours.
			Mister Worf, prepare for immediate
			evacuation.
			Evacuation will be difficult.
			Our shields can be lowered for
			transport only between the flares.
			Captain, these people have been
			isolated for three hundred
			years. We cannot beam them to
			the Enterprise without warning.
			And if they have slipped back
			into barbarism the experience
			would scare them to death.
			You'll have to go down there,
			Number One.
			On my way.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Commander Riker has reached the
			caverns, but we are still waiting
			to begin the evacuation.
			What's the situation, Number One?
			There are roughly two hundred
			people down here.
			Their condition?
			Surprisingly good.
			Are they willing to leave?
			Yes, but --
			Well, get them up here.
			I'm having a little altercation
			with the colony's leader.
			I'm not interested, Commander.
			Initiate the transport.
			But, sir --
			No arguments.
			Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way.
			All of us. Riker out.
			Uh... Captain, you better get down
			here.
			Right away!
			Ah, O'Brien, I should have known
			that a good Irishman would be
			running this ship, and not some
			Frenchy.
			Shoo! Shoo, damn you!
			What the devil is going on
			here?!
			Oh, Picard is it. The man who
			makes decisions for me and mine
			without so much as a by-your-
			leave.
			Do you generally have him on a
			leash?
			My security chief, Lieutenant
			Worf.
			Danilo Odell, at your service.
			I don't want your service, Mister
			Odell. I want this damn
			livestock off my ship.
			You said you didn't want to waste
			time arguing.
			Captain, this damn livestock has
			fed our children, been company
			to the old and sick and playmates
			to the young...
			And can this man ever argue.
			... I couldn't leave them to
			die. Besides, how can we rebuild
			without our animals?
			Alright. Chief O'Brien, kindly
			transport this group to Cargo
			Hold Seven, and the remaining
			refugees on the planet should go
			directly into the hold so we can
			stop dirtying my ship.
			Yes, sir.
			Back onto the infernal machine.
			We're taking another little ride.
			We've got to have a little talk.
			Er... fine, and then Mister Worf
			can show you the ship.
			That would be grand. And Captain,
			it was grand of you to resue us
			from out troubles.
			My pleasure.
			You must be worth quite a bit to
			own a ship like this.
			I don't own the Enterprise, I
			command her.
			Whatever. Would you happen to
			be married?
			No. Why?
			I have a daughter.
			I felicitate you.
			Would you be interested?
			No!
			You're sure?
			Yes!
			What is the colonists' overall
			condition?
			They're a little hungry, a little
			scared, but hiding it well. They
			were suffering from an amazing
			variety of preventable diseases -- but
			the transporter handled
			that. They're also tough,
			determined and fun. Overall,
			I'd say they're charming examples
			of homo sapiens at their best.
			What's the total?
			Two hundred and twenty-three.
			Count on four more in the next
			few days.
			Next question, what to do with
			them? Take them to a starbase?
			They were anachronistic in 2123.
			How will they cope?
			There's no question they could
			learn and adapt, but it would be
			dislocating, and the colony would
			probably be splintered. Maybe
			we should be looking for a new
			home for them?
			Lieutenant Worf, report!
			Fire in Cargo Hold Seven.
			The Bringloidi!
			I wonder what they've done to my
			ship now.
			Unseal the doors.
			My God, Picard, the place is a
			bloody death trap! Lightning
			bolts falling from the ceiling!
			What the hell was that thing?
			Automated fire system. A force
			field contains the flames until
			the available oxygen within the
			field has been consumed.
			What if I had been under that
			thing?
			You would have been standing in
			the fire.
			Well, ignoring that for the
			moment. What would have happened
			to me?
			You would have suffocated and
			died.
			Sweet mercy.
			Your hospitality leaves a hell
			of a lot to be desired! You don't
			offer us a bite or a sup, and when
			we build a fire to cook a little
			something, the place goes mad!
			My apologies, ma'am, I was unaware
			that you had not been instructed
			in the use of the food dispensers.
			And what are you staring at? Have
			you never seen a woman before?
			I thought I had.
			Commander, may I present my
			daughter, Brenna Odell.
			Very pleased to meet you, ma'am.
			You may have all the time in the
			world, but I've dozens of
			frightened and hungry women and
			children to care for.
			What about the men?
			I'm sure they'll find their
			comfort as they always do -- in
			the bottom of a mug of home brew!
			Pay her no heed, she's a grand
			girl. And not usually so...
			er...
			... sharp tongued.
			Father!
			Of all the reactions that's not
			the one I expected.
			Number One, there are times in
			life when you have to simply bow
			to the absurd.
			How did the ship sense the fire?
			The... ah... ship's computers
			sense a localized increase in --
			Men! Always talking when there's
			work to be done.
			Shouldn't you be flying this ship,
			or whatever it is you do?
			I think I'll go give her some
			help, Captain.
			That wasn't necessary. The ship
			will clean itself.
			Well, good for the bloody ship!
			Where does a girl go to wash her
			feet on this ship?
			I think it's the responsibility
			of the ship's first officer to
			show that girl all the amenities.
			She is very like a Klingon woman,
			Captain.
			My condolences, Mister Worf.
			Ah, Captain, there's just one
			other thing. It slipped my mind
			in all the hustle and bustle --
			The point, Mister Odell?
			What are you going to do about
			the other colony?
			Other colony?
			Captain's log, supplemental. A
			review of stellar charts has
			revealed a Class M planet, NB2323
			only half a light year from the
			Bringloid system. I am gambling
			it was the destination of the
			second colony.
			Behave yourself.
			You're a fine woman, and you've
			made a young man of me.
			No, I've cured your arthritis,
			and if you try anything more
			energetic you'll probably drop
			dead.
			I'd die happy.
			Out.
			You know how to handle men.
			Yes, first you have to get their
			attention.
			How did you give Joey back his
			hand?
			Oh dear, that would be difficult
			to explain.
			Like everything else aboard this
			ship. I'm too ignorant to
			understand. And this is the one
			thing that looks useful.
			You're interested in medicine?
			I'm healer and midwife. Or I
			thought I was.
			All I've every wanted is to take
			away the hurt. These wonderful
			tools help me do that, but
			sometimes I feel more like a
			mechanic than a doctor.
			You've the hands of a healer.
			You can't put that in a machine.
			I'll leave you ladies to your
			discussions. Dinner, Brenna?
			I'll cook.
			Is he real?
			Oh, yes, very real.
			William Riker, you're a mess.
			You don't have to do that.
			And if I don't, who will?
			I can see why your father wants
			to marry you off.
			Oh, and why is that?
			So he can have a pipe, and mug
			of beer in peace.
			You've shown me so many wonders
			on your great ship, but there is
			still one thing you haven't shown
			me.
			What's that?
			I'm still waiting to wash my feet.
			Through there. Glass of wine
			while I cook?
			William, is something wrong?
			What do you mean?
			Do you not like girls?
			Of course I like... Oh... is there
			a technique to this foot washing?
			You generally start low... and
			work your way up.
			I think I can handle that.
			I was hoping you might.
			Feeling better, Worf?
			Yes. And you, Commander?
			Couldn't be better.
			Status, Mister Data?
			Warp factor five, continuing on
			course for NB2323. E.t.a. eighteen
			hours.
			Excellent.
			You sent for me?
			We're brewing poteen, but we need
			a way to heat it without this
			bloody ship firing bloody
			lightning bolts at us.
			You can obtain spiritous liquors
			from the food dispensers.
			It's not that synthehol bilge
			O'Brien offered me, is it?
			No, if you wish it can be real
			alcohol.
			Good.
			With all of the deleterious
			effects intact.
			As it should be.
			You see, lad, every moment of
			pleasure has to be purchased by
			an equal moment of pain.
			Whiskey.
			Terrible.
			It's got no bite.
			Chech'tluth.
			Now that's what I call a wee drop
			of the creature.
			Father!!
			You remember that moment of pain?
			Well, it's about to begin.
			Hello, darling.
			Darling is it! I might have
			known!
			Are you drunk yet, or can you talk
			with Doctor Pulaski about the
			children?
			What about them?
			She wants to send them to school
			with the ship's children.
			What do you think?
			I think it's a good idea.
			So go handle it!
			And I'm sure there's something
			you can be doing with your time.
			And as for you...
			What!
			Why did you have to tell them that
			this magic wall can give them more
			than meat and potatoes? Now we'll
			never get a lick of work out of
			them.
			Madam, have you considered a
			career in security?
			If it's anything like babysitting
			-- I'm an authority.
			Signal from the planet, Captain.
			On screen.
			This is Jean-Luc Picard of the
			United Federation vessel USS
			Enterprise.
			This is tremendous! Welcome,
			Captain, I'm Wilson Granger, prime
			minister of Mariposa.
			No doubt a descendant of Captain
			Walter Granger.
			Not quite a descendant.
			We feared that Earth had suffered
			a catastrophe when no one came
			to check on us.
			I'm afraid you were lost in the
			bureaucracy, but despite the
			lateness of our arrival we are
			here now, and eager to renew ties.
			Splendid! Please, come down, and
			allow us to extend our hospitality
			to you and your crew.
			Number One, form an away team.
			I would urge caution. Mister
			Granger is hiding something.
			We'll check it out. Mister Worf.
			Doctor Pulaski join me in
			Transporter Room Three for an away
			detail.
			Welcome to Mariposa. Victor
			Granger, minister of health.
			William Riker, Doctor Pulaski,
			Lieutenant Worf.
			I'll escort you to the prime
			minister. This way please.
			A brother?
			Your arrival really is
			serendipitous.
			Oh, how so?
			Well, perhaps I should leave that
			for the prime minister to
			explain.
			Worf, stand by for immediate beam
			out. There's something damn odd
			down here.
			Aye, Commander.
			Is your title scientific or
			medical?
			Medical.
			Ah, excellent.
			Is there some medical problem we
			should know about?
			I think it best if the --
			Prime minister explains that.
			Somehow I thought you might.
			Welcome to Mariposa.
			Doctor Katherine Pulaski.
			My chief of staff, Elizabeth
			Vallis.
			So, is your entire population made
			up of clones, Prime Minister?
			Clones?
			Clones?
			Clones.
			Captain's log, supplemental. Prime
			Minister Granger has requested
			an urgent meeting to discuss the
			future of the Mariposan colony.
			Captain, we need your help.
			Three hundred years ago during
			our landing on Mariposa, the skin
			of the ship was breached. Only
			five colonists survived. The
			progenitors weren't willing to
			just give up and die, and they
			were scientists --
			So they used that expertise and
			turned to cloning.
			Yes. They had no other option.
			Two women and three men were an
			insufficient gene pool from which
			to build a society.
			How did you suppress the natural
			sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive
			laws?
			In the beginning we used a little
			of both. Now three hundred years
			later the entire concept of
			sexual reproduction is a little
			repugnant to us.
			A culture with no children.
			It's economically more viable to
			accelerate clone growth. Some
			basic learning can be chemically
			imprinted on the developing clone,
			the rest we do after emergence.
			How did you overcome the problem
			of replicative fading?
			We didn't.
			You have got a problem.
			Wait. I don't understand.
			Replecative fading?
			Each time you clone you're making
			a copy of a copy. Subtle errors
			creep into the chromosomes, and
			eventually you end up with a
			non-viable clone.
			Yes. We're developing a sort
			of mental hardening of the
			arteries. It's increasingly
			difficult to respond to new
			situations.
			How can we help?
			We need an infusion of fresh DNA.
			I was hoping that you would be
			willing to share tissue samples
			from your crew.
			You want to clone us?
			Yes.
			No way. Not me.
			How can you possibly be harmed?
			It's not a question of harm. A
			single William Riker is unique,
			maybe even special. Hundreds or
			thousands of them diminish me in
			a way I can't explain.
			You would be preserving yourself.
			Human beings have another way of
			doing that. We have children.
			I think you will find this to be
			the attitude of a predominate
			number of Enterprise people.
			I see. Well, if you will not help
			us by sharing your DNA will you
			at least send people to repair
			our malfunctioning equipment?
			Yes, of course. Number One, form
			away teams, and get the repairs
			underway.
			Yes, sir.
			Repairing the equipment is not
			going to solve your problems.
			What other solution do we have?
			Remember, Doctor, there are only
			five of us.
			You sent for us?
			Excuse me, sir, I was looking for
			Commander Riker.
			I'm afraid I haven't seen him.
			Doctor Pulaski?
			Sorry, I can't help you.
			Guess I'll just have to hunt for
			them. Sorry to disturb you.
			And after a long and gentle sleep
			we awoke and there was Bringloid,
			our dream world. Our companions
			in the butterfly ship left us
			off, and said they would leave
			a guard in heaven to look out for
			us.
			They flew on in the darkness -- their
			search was not yet over -- but
			we had found the sun, a
			world, a home.
			And now we have lost it.
			We'll find another.
			When? How long must we wait and
			journey?
			I finally understand. That
			distress satellite was left by
			the Mariposans as a way to protect
			the Bringloidi. There were two
			colonies on that ship.
			Interesting, Captain.
			And not terribly relevant, I know.
			Still, it gives one pause for
			thought....
			What happened on Mariposa? Are
			you all right?
			Is there some reason why we
			shouldn't be?
			Yeah, every time I asked where
			you were, some clone lied to me.
			Lied to you?
			Commander, with this I can see
			a lot more than your average
			person. When people lie there
			are certain physical
			manifestations; variations in
			blush response, pupil dilation,
			pulse and breath rate. I can't
			use the VISOR on aliens, but
			humans -- I've got them nailed.
			And the clones lied about our
			whereabouts?
			Yes.
			I don't remember anything
			happening. I was working in
			their medical facility when I got
			a call to report to Granger's
			office. I ran into Will on the
			way and --
			Granger said he hadn't seen
			either of you. Did you get to
			his office?
			I don't remember.
			So what's the prognosis, Doc?
			Will I ever play the piano again?
			Geordi, you'll be pleased to know
			that you aren't missing any
			epithelial cells.
			Great.
			Will and I, however, are.
			Meaning?
			Although you can clone from any
			cell in the human body the cells
			lining the stomach are the best
			choice because they're relatively
			undifferentiated.
			Where are you going?
			To that cloning lab.
			I don't suppose you'd believe this
			was an accident?
			Murderers!
			Like hell! You're a damn thief!
			Gentlemen, please.
			What else could we do? We asked
			for your help and you refused!
			We're desperate. Desperate!
			So that gives you the right to
			assault us, and rob us, and --
			We have a right to survive!
			Doctor, how desperate is the
			colony's situation?
			They've got two maybe three more
			generations, then the fading will
			become terminal. They're the
			walking dead now, they just
			haven't been buried.
			I want that cloning equipment
			inspected. Who knows how many
			tissue samples they've stolen.
			I have the right to exercise
			control over my own body.
			You'll get no argument from me.
			I know the Mariposan culture seems
			alien, even frightening, but we
			really do have much in common.
			They're human beings fighting to
			survive. Would we do any less?
			Are you saying we should give them
			the DNA samples they require?
			That's just postponing the
			inevitable. So they get an
			infusion of fresh DNA -- fifteen
			generations and they're back to
			the same problem. Cloning isn't
			the answer. They need breeding
			stock.
			The Bringloidi.
			The Bringloidi have energy and
			drive, a sense of wonder. The
			clones possess emotional maturity,
			and technological know-how.
			They started out together. It
			does seem only fitting that they
			end up together.
			It's a match made in heaven.
			Unfortunately it's going to be
			a shotgun wedding.
			I'm sorry, Captain, but it's out
			of the question. You're trying
			to dump your problem off on us.
			And we've got problems of our own.
			Can't you understand? The
			Bringloidi can help you.
			Look at him. How could we ever
			integrate that into our society?
			You're no prize yourself.
			Primitive, hostile, disruptive.
			It would require enormous effort
			to even educate them.
			Forget it, Captain Picard. I'm
			not coming with my hat in my hand
			to beg charity from this bastard.
			Sit down! I am not going to allow
			brag...
			... and bigotry...
			... to destroy this meeting.
			Commander Riker wants your
			laboratories inspected for any
			stolen tissue. I can understnad
			his concern, and I think we're
			going to have to transport all
			of your equipment to the
			Enterprise.
			I see, when reason fails you'll
			resort to blackmail.
			All right, die!
			It's not so bad, Captain. In
			fifty years we'll have a new
			Class M planet, complete with
			cities, all ready for
			colonization.
			The end is closer than you'd like
			to think.
			I don't know. The difficulties
			involved...
			Look, man, we're decent, hard
			working people. We're willing
			to learn.
			They're so different.
			Yes. But it's differences which
			have made us strong.
			An open society is a healthy
			society. When you allow your
			culture to become a melting pot
			it grows in exciting directions.
			For three hundred years we've
			denied the carnal side of our
			nature. How can we learn to put
			that aside?
			You put a couple of young people
			together and you let nature take
			its course.
			To make this work you're going
			to have to alter your society,
			too. Monogamous marriage won't
			be possible for several
			generations.
			I'm not sure I follow.
			Thirty couples are enough to
			create a viable genetic base.
			But the broader the base the safer
			and healthier the society. It
			would be best if each woman -- Mariposan
			and Bringloidi -- had
			at least three children by three
			different men.
			I think I could handle that.
			God, this is so... so...
			Frightening?
			Repugnant.
			The normal drives are still there.
			You're just going to have to alter
			your attitudes.
			So, it's a done deal?
			My hand on it.
			Now come on, I want to stake out
			my three ladies. Send in the
			clones.
			I must be out of my mind.
			Starfleet's probably going to
			agree.
			Isn't that just like a man! You
			make these grandiose decisions,
			but you never stop to consider
			the poor women.
			Miss Odell, I am --
			You men draw a mug, and solve all
			the world's problems while the
			beer goes down. But when it comes
			to the practical matters it always
			falls to the women to make your
			grand dreams come true.
			Miss Odell, you're the one who
			wanted a new home.
			But I don't know if I want to
			be Eve!
			That is your choice. If you wish
			to stay aboard the Enterprise we
			will drop you at a starbase, and
			you can go where you will.
			Leave my dad?
			Brenna, you've always been the
			mothering force for your people.
			If this is going to work they'll
			need your wisdom and guidance.
			But my life has just gotten very
			narrow.
			We have to make choices.
			Oh, damn.
			What does he do again?
			He's the prime minister.
			Sounds important.
			It is.
			Sounds like he might have more
			than two coins to rub together.
			Three husbands?
			All squared away?
			The Bringloidi have reached their
			new home.
			It is unfortunate that we cannot
			remain for several months, and
			observe the integration of the
			two colonies.
			They're going to do just fine.
			They're survivors, both of them.
			We've done what we could. We've
			put the cats in the same sack,
			and given it a good shake.
			But what is occurring on Mariposa
			is a demonstration of
			sociobiology, and the concept of
			the selfish gene.
			Males and females are each
			pursuing their respective
			reproductive strategies in an
			effort to maximize their
			contribution to the gene pool of
			the next generation.
			Data, I liked the captain's
			analogy better.
			Why?
			It was more romantic.
			How are cats in a sack romantic?
			They would fight and scratch
			and...
			Very romantic. I hunt in darkness.
			The stars my guide. The memory
			of you sings in my blood. I seize
			the gift.
			Carry it to your bower. And lay
			at your feet the hearts of my
			enemies.
			Engage.
			Perhaps it does not translate
			well.
