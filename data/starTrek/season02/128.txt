			You're worried.
			With reason.
			About Worf, or about Commander
			Riker?
			Both.
			I think perhaps it is best to
			be ignorant of certain elements
			of the Klingon psyche.
			Above, look out!
			It's over.
			The exercise is over.
			At ease, Lieutenant!
			Exit Holodeck.
			You do this every day?
			No -- usually my calisthenics are
			more...
			... intense, but those sessions
			are too personal to be shared.
			I'll bet they are.
			Computer. Program complete --
			save.
			Coming Commander?
			Right behind you.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42193.6.
			We are on a long reach toward the
			Morgana Quadrant, a section of
			the galaxy which has yet to be
			visited by a manned Federation
			vessel. We are using the time
			to further detail the charts of
			this region.
			There it is again. An area of
			"blackness."
			It appears, then disappears, then
			reappears. There is no
			predictable pattern -- no sequence.
			On screen.
			There it is.
			I can't see anything. Magnify
			section two-eight-five.
			There -- it looks like a "hole"
			in space.
			We're acquainted with the
			"wormhole" phenomenon. This
			appears quite different.
			What do sensors indicate?
			Nothing.
			Nothing?
			I'm sure you must mean it's empty
			of matter, Mister Data. There
			is always some energy form at
			work...
			Sir, our sensors are showing that
			to be an absence of everything.
			It is a void without matter or
			energy of any kind.
			Yet, this "hole" has a form, Data.
			It has height, width...
			Perhaps. Perhaps not.
			That is hardly a scientific
			observation, Commander.
			Sir, the most elementary and
			valuable statement in science...
			the beginning of wisdom... is:
			"I do not know."
			I do not know what that is.
			Captain, if this were any ordinary
			kind of hole in space...
			... wouldn't we be able to see
			what's behind it?
			Counselor?
			I can feel nothing from it, sir,
			if that's what you're asking.
			Data -- is there any record of any
			occurrence even vaguely similar
			to this?
			"Similar" in even the slightest
			way.
			Accessing.
			Negative. There is no record of
			any Federation vessel encountering
			anything remotely like this.
			I believe we have time for a
			closer look, Number One.
			Concur.
			Ensign, slow to one-half impulse.
			Adjust course to intercept this...
			this whatever it is.
			Scanning and recording as we go.
			Changing course to intercept in...
			in twelve minutes, sir.
			Let's send a probe into it.
			Worf, prepare a scanner probe.
			Let's see what's in there.
			Close enough, Ensign. Hold this
			position.
			Aye, sir. Holding this position.
			You may launch the probe when
			ready, Mister Worf.
			All the probe's systems are
			functioning perfectly.
			It's gone.
			What happened, Data?
			Unknown.
			Recommend we go to a Yellow Alert,
			sir.
			Why?
			Sorry, sir, it's...
			Explain.
			This starship operates best,
			Mister Worf, when we all know what
			is on each other's minds.
			My thoughts... were of an old
			Klingon legend of... of a gigantic
			black space creature which was
			said to devour entire vessels...
			Devours vessels?
			Sorry, Commander. I agree that
			these are thoughts hardly worthy
			of a trained and practical
			security officer.
			Launch another probe, Mister Worf.
			This time a Class One with full
			sensor array.
			Launching, sir.
			Happened even more quickly.
			Recommend we fire a photon
			torpedo, Captain.
			Negative.
			Captain, based on where the probes
			disappeared... I have been able
			to plot the outer boundaries.
			I could move in closer.
			Take us in, Mister Crusher.
			Thrusters only.
			Data?
			Still no readings of any kind,
			sir.
			Number One?
			I'll agree with Worf at this
			point, sir. Let's be careful.
			What's happened?
			Data?
			Whatever it was... or whatever
			it is... we seem to be inside of
			it.
			Didn't that happen a bit suddenly,
			sir?
			All stations, report!
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			While exploring a strange area
			in space without any form of
			matter or energy...
			... a total void, we have
			unexpectedly seemed to enter it.
			Apparently we moved past its
			mysterious outer boundary.
			All stations have reported,
			Captain. There seems to be no
			immediate threat to our ship or
			crew.
			In which case, let's hold position
			for awhile, Number One. This is
			worth studying.
			Incredible. It's like looking
			off into... infinity, sir.
			Remember the course in ancient
			history at Starfleet Academy?
			Back to the time when men still
			believed the Earth was flat?
			And that the sun revolved around
			the Earth...
			And if a ship sailed too far out
			into the ocean it would fall off
			the edge of the world...
			"Beyond this place there be
			dragons."
			Data -- how long to complete your
			scans? Let's not stay any longer
			than we have to.
			Captain, we have no communications
			outside of the void.
			Confirm! We are now receiving
			no signals of any kind.
			Hello, Doctor. You've been
			briefed on what's happened?
			I've heard, Captain. But I don't
			understand it.
			I wish I could say I did.
			Increase magnification by ten.
			By one hundred!
			I'm not a bridge officer, but
			isn't this... "impossible," sir?
			Increase by one thousand, Mister
			Data.
			By ten thousand.
			It does know how to do these
			things, doesn't it?
			Commander Data knows precisely
			what he is doing.
			Forgive me, Mister Data. I'm not
			accustomed to working with... with
			non-living devices that...
			Forgive me again. Your service
			record says that you are alive
			and I must accept that.
			Engineering!
			Engineering, aye.
			Lieutenant, are your systems
			functioning?
			Yes, sir. Wherever we are, sir,
			it seems to have no effect on any
			Engineering function.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Data?
			Difficult to make a judgment based
			on the absence of information.
			Speculate.
			The obvious hypothesis is
			equivocal. This void has a total
			lack of dimension. Therefore by
			any accepted standard it does not
			exist, yet being within it denies
			that conclusion.
			Then maybe we've moved into
			another dimension?
			Could a lack of dimension be
			another dimension in itself?
			That's an interesting question.
			For a later discussion. It's
			time we got on with our mission,
			Number One. Starfleet can send
			out a science vessel to
			investigate further. Let's move
			back out of this.
			Aye, sir.
			Reverse our direction and set a
			course for the Cornelian star
			system. Warp two.
			Reversing direction, sir.
			Course laid in.
			Engage.
			Our engines have engaged, haven't
			they, Ensign?
			Aye, sir.
			Everything all right up there,
			Captain?
			Are the engines operating
			normally, Engineer?
			Everything looks fine here, sir.
			We're increasing to warp four,
			Engineer.
			We now show warp four, Captain.
			We should be seeing stars by now,
			Data. How far have we come?
			Inertial guidance shows seven
			parsecs traveled, Captain.
			Ensign Crusher?
			Confirm, sir. Exactly what my
			readings say.
			Engineering, transfer to bridge.
			What's happening, sir? I thought
			we should have broken clear.
			We should have. We're on a
			reverse course.
			Full stop, helm.
			Full stop, sir.
			According to this we're well past
			the point we entered the void.
			Except that we are still in it,
			sir.
			Captain... if we dropped a
			stationary beacon and navigated
			straight away from it, we would
			have a fixed point of reference
			to confirm speed and distance.
			Make it so, Data. Lock onto the
			beacon, and keep it dead astern.
			The beacon is in place, Captain.
			Dead ahead. Impulse power.
			The beacon is falling astern.
			Engineering, report.
			All systems normal, sir.
			Prepare to increase to warp two.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, we are receiving a signal
			from dead ahead.
			Maybe you've found the door out
			of this.
			We are closing on the new signal,
			Captain.
			Identify.
			Captain, it is the stationary
			beacon we just released.
			We must have come full circle,
			sir.
			We couldn't have, sir. I've shown
			us steadily moving away from that
			beacon.
			All stop; hold position again.
			Look.
			Captain, sensors indicate a
			disturbance in sector one-zero-
			eight. Possibly a vessel.
			Perhaps some answers at last.
			On screen.
			The ship is equipped with a
			cloaking device.
			Romulan!
			It's closing.
			Shields up. Go to Red Alert!
			I'll be at my duty station in
			Sickbay.
			It's uncloaking.
			Arm your photon torpedoes, Mister
			Worf.
			Hold for my orders.
			There!
			Direct hits, sir. Our shields
			are weakening.
			Warn them we'll return fire.
			Transmitting.
			They've armed another full spread,
			sir.
			Fire torpedoes.
			That was too easy.
			Yes.
			Captain, sensors can locate no
			debris from the Romulan ship.
			Captain, there is another vessel
			approaching -- sector zero-nine-
			one, mark, two-six.
			Specifics.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			It's a Federation ship.
			N-C-C... one-three-oh-five dash
			E. It is the USS Yamato, our
			sister ship.
			The Yamato is nowhere near this
			quadrant.
			Open a hailing frequency, Data....
			This is the USS Enterprise to...
			USS Yamato. Respond, please...
			This is the USS Enterprise calling
			USS Yamato. Please respond on
			this frequency.
			No response, Captain.
			Make a full scan.
			Life support system -- engineering
			and propulsion all seem
			functional.
			But there are no life signs over
			there, sir.
			Can we be getting a false
			reading, Data?
			Since we know nothing at all about
			these circumstances, that is...
			at least, conceivable, sir.
			You look doubtful, sir.
			I'm not anything right now, Number
			One. I'm just a man looking for
			answers.
			Like the rat said -- "Keep the
			cheese, I just want out of the
			trap."
			Captain, request permission to
			board the Yamato with an away
			team. There might be something
			onboard -- in the logs -- which will
			at least tell us what happened.
			Granted. Minimum complement.
			Worf. You're with me.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			remain like a fly in amber trapped
			in the void. We have encountered
			a vessel which appears to be the
			USS Yamato. All its systems are
			shown as functioning, yet it seems
			devoid of life. Commander Riker
			is leading an away team --
			hopefully the answer lies over
			there.
			Do you have a lock on that other
			ship?
			Aye, sir. No problems at all.
			Can you put us on the bridge?
			Anywhere you say, Commander.
			I am acquainted with the Yamato,
			Commander. Recommend the Aft
			Station of their bridge. When
			in doubt, surprise them.
			Them? Who's them?
			Whoever may be there.
			Sensors show no life signs.
			Still, the tactic is sound.
			Agreed.
			Aft Station.
			Aye, sir.
			Phasers on stun, Lieutenant Worf.
			Energize.
			This isn't the bridge.
			No -- don't fire.
			I heard you screaming. I was
			coming to help.
			Help me? But I heard you cry out.
			Transporter Chief, where do you
			show us over here?
			We show... as approximately...
			Captain, do you read me?...
			... having difficulties...
			Number One, come in!
			Transporter Room, this is the
			captain. We are out of contact
			with the away team. Beam them
			back, immediately.
			I have lost the lock on them.
			Nothing on my communicator, sir.
			Computer, on.
			Let's find a turbolift to the
			bridge.
			Transporter Room -- have you been
			able to establish a lock?
			Initiate full check -- all
			systems.
			Engineering section, report. What
			is our situation?
			This isn't a Federation ship.
			The walls are not tritanium...
			close, but it's a material beyond
			our technology.
			Let's get to the bridge.
			Somewhere there must be an answer
			to all of this.
			Wait -- if you go through there...
			where will you be?
			On the bridge.
			But we are on the bridge.
			Should I continue?
			Yes -- move out. Let's see what
			happens.
			Is it the same bridge?
			... Or did we just step from one
			bridge to another bridge?
			Captain! I have a star fix.
			On screen.
			It's an opening, sir.
			Confirm, navigation is possible.
			Should I set a course?
			Transporter Room. Do you have
			a fix on the away team?
			Negative.
			Commander.
			At ease, Lieutenant! At EASE!
			The star fix is fading.
			Haskell, lock on to the Yamato
			with the tractor beam. We leave
			together.
			I can't make the lock.
			Captain. The star fix is fading.
			Let it go, Data.
			But, sir, we can get out.
			Let it go.
			Bridge, I've re-established
			contact with the away team.
			The Yamato's beginning to fade
			out, Captain.
			Come in, come in Enterprise.
			Hold position, away team. I've
			got you. We are bringing you
			home!
			Transporter Room, hurry!
			Captain, it's almost gone.
			What the hell's going on?
			Are you all right, Number One?
			Yes, but I've had it. Let's put
			all this technology and computers
			to work -- figure out what's going
			on -- and get the hell out of
			here.
			A ship that was almost the Yamato,
			existing in a "hole in space,"
			no crew aboard -- what's the
			purpose?
			Add to it an attack by a
			nonexistent Romulan vessel, it
			does suggest an interesting
			question: "Was our away team even
			over there?"
			If we weren't over there, where
			the hell were we?
			Captain, I have re-established
			the star fix.
			Great.
			Set course -- velocity -- warp two.
			Course and speed set.
			Engage.
			I have lost contact.
			What?
			The star fix is gone.
			Sir, it is not in the same sector.
			But another opening has appeared.
			On screen.
			Set a course for those stars.
			Warp six.
			Yes, sir -- warp six.
			I have lost the signal.
			Damn it.
			All stop.
			Captain...
			I know Data, I can see it.
			This game is now wearing very
			thin.
			Hold this position.
			Counselor, you have said you
			sensed no intelligence behind all
			of this. You haven't changed in
			that belief?
			I'm not so certain of that now,
			Captain. I do sense something
			unusual about all this...
			Perhaps a different level of
			consciousness?
			An intelligence so vast it eluded
			me? Yes, perhaps.
			Rats in a maze.
			Exactly!
			Explain.
			Everything we've been through
			reminds me of a laboratory
			experiment. As though something
			were testing our responses to
			stimuli.
			Are you suggesting we're in some
			kind of laboratory?
			Yes.
			The opening seems closer,
			Captain.
			We're finished with being led
			about this way.
			Agreed, Captain. Hold present
			position.
			Good. Don't satisfy its
			curiosity.
			Why are you so alarmed when I've
			gone to such trouble to look just
			like you?
			Return to your position,
			Lieutenant.
			Sir... ?
			Captain, sensors show nothing out
			there. Absolutely nothing.
			It's a damned ugly nothing.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the USS Enterprise.
			... representing a Federation of
			planets in this part of the
			galaxy.
			Can you identify whoever or
			whatever you are?
			NAGILUM!
			Speaks right out for something
			your sensors say isn't there,
			Data.
			We've still no idea of what you
			represent.
			"Data."
			Nagilum?
			You are of different construction
			than the others. Interesting.
			Picard... Riker... Geordi...
			Wesley...
			What are you? Your construction
			also differs.
			My "construction"... ?
			Perhaps referring to your gender.
			Yes, I see...
			There are minor differences. I
			am what we call a "female."
			I understand. The masculine and
			the feminine.
			It is the way in which we
			propagate our species.
			Please demonstrate how this is
			accomplished.
			Not likely.
			Whatever you are, your actions
			are not welcome.
			Let me put up the shields, sir.
			Our sensors do not show anything
			there, Worf.
			Your life-form surprises me more
			and more. Is it also true that
			you have only a limited existence?
			Answer!
			What information do you want?
			I don't understand the question.
			You exist -- and then you cease
			to exist. Your minds call it
			"death."
			How interesting.
			Sickbay?
			It won't help. The body is
			already cold.
			We cannot allow you to do that!
			We'll fight you...
			To understand death, I must amass
			information on every aspect of
			it, every kind of dying. The
			experiments shouldn't take more
			than a third of your crew, maybe
			half.
			Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7.
			It is obvious that whatever we
			have met sees no value in our kind
			of life-form. How do we fight
			something that both is...
			... and is not there?
			I can sense this much. We are
			unimportant to it.
			In a battle for survival, Captain,
			thirty to fifty percent
			casualties...
			... Would be appalling...
			... But within acceptable limits.
			This is not a battle, Lieutenant.
			A "laboratory experiment" would
			be the closest comparison.
			Is there any reason for not
			believing this Nagilum?
			No.
			All evidence indicates he is
			willing and able to do what he
			proposes.
			Agreed. Under the circumstances
			-- there is only one decision.
			I will not stand by and watch
			while half of my crew is
			slaughtered.
			Sir... I do not believe there is
			anything you can do to prevent
			it.
			No. But I can control it.
			How?
			By destroying the Enterprise.
			Isn't that like curing the disease
			by killing the patient?
			At least it's better than
			standing by helplessly and dying.
			Why do I feel this may not have
			been the best time to join this
			ship? I'll be in Sickbay if I'm
			needed.
			I will be at my station, Captain.
			Recognize Picard... Jean-Luc...
			Recognize Riker... William T.
			Initiate auto-destruct sequence.
			Does Riker... William T. concur?
			I do. Initiate auto-destruct
			sequence.
			What is the desired time interval?
			Stand by.
			Interesting question. How long
			to prepare to die?
			Which is the least painful to our
			crew? Move to it quickly? Or
			take time to prepare for it
			thoroughly?
			Hell, twenty minutes sounds like
			a nice round figure. Can we do
			that?
			The latest program allows it.
			Initiate auto-destruct in twenty
			minutes.
			Twenty minutes to auto-destruct,
			mark.
			Nineteen minutes, fifty seconds...
			Come.
			Our destroying ourselves won't
			change its mind. I could feel
			that.
			You didn't mention you were that
			certain.
			I was wrong not to tell you,
			Captain. And your decision may
			also be wrong.
			Yes? Come in, please.
			I have a question, sir.
			What is death?
			You've picked probably the most
			difficult of all questions, Data.
			Some explain it by inventing
			gods wearing their own form...
			and argue that the purpose of the
			entire universe is to maintain
			themselves in their present form
			in an Earth-like garden which
			will give them pleasure through
			all eternity. And at the other
			extreme, assuming that is an
			"extreme," are those who prefer
			the idea of our blinking into
			nothingness with all our
			experiences, hopes and dreams only
			an illusion.
			Which do you believe?
			Considering the marvelous
			complexity of our universe, its
			clockwork perfection, its balances
			of this against that... matter,
			energy, gravitation, time,
			dimension, pattern, I believe
			our existence must mean more than
			a meaningless illusion. I prefer
			to believe that my and your
			existence goes beyond Euclidian
			and other "practical" measuring
			systems... and that, in ways
			we cannot yet fathom, our
			existence is part of a reality
			beyond what we understand now
			as reality.
			We should not let ourselves die,
			Jean-Luc!
			I agree with her, Captain.
			If only half of us live, I prefer
			to take my chances on being one
			that does.
			Yes. It's wrong of you to force
			us into this...
			It is wrong...
			Yes, this is very wrong. None
			of you should be reacting like
			this.
			Computer, locate Commander Data.
			Commander Data is on the bridge.
			It's not going to work, Nagilum.
			Captain, we are clear. We are
			out of the void.
			It's gone, Captain -- we can abort
			the auto-destruct.
			Hold, Number One.
			But...
			Hold.
			Fifty seconds to auto-destruct.
			Thirty seconds to auto-destruct.
			Captain, we are clear of the
			void. You may stop the
			auto-destruct.
			Data, on any heading -- warp six
			-- now!
			Captain.
			I don't believe it, Number One.
			It could still be part of the
			illusion. Data, report.
			All navigational systems confirm
			-- we are at warp six -- on
			course...
			Ten seconds to auto-destruct.
			Nine seconds. Eight seconds.
			Seven seconds... Six seconds...
			... to the Morgana Quadrant.
			Five seconds. Four seconds...
			Troi?
			It's gone, Captain. I no longer
			sense its presence.
			Abort auto-destruct sequence.
			Three seconds. Two seconds...
			Riker, William T. Do you concur?
			Yes! Absolutely! I do indeed
			concur! Wholeheartedly!
			A simple "yes" would have been
			sufficient, Number One.
			I didn't want there to be any
			chance of a misunderstanding.
			He sure held that bluff to the
			last second.
			What bluff?
			Well, Nagilum... I hope you got
			what you needed.
			You have provided me with much
			more than I needed...
			Why did you release us? You
			could have seen how we faced
			death.
			It wasn't necessary. I have
			learned all I needed to know.
			Would you like me to share some
			of my conclusions?
			I'm not interested.
			Of course you are. You are too
			inquisitive not to want to know.
			You seem to find no tranquility
			in anything. You struggle against
			the inevitable. You thrive on
			conflict. You are selfish, yet
			you value loyalty. You are rash,
			quick to judge, slow to change.
			It's amazing you've survived.
			Be that as it may -- as species,
			we have no common ground. You
			are too aggressive. Too hostile.
			Too militant.
			During this period, you too have
			been evaluated. It would seem
			we have at least one thing in
			common.
			Oh?
			Curiosity.
			The point is well taken, Captain.
			Perhaps that is a trait we share.
			Then perhaps we'll meet again.
			But next time, it will be out
			here among the stars.
			Put us back on course, at warp
			three.
			Warp three, sir...
			And Ensign -- let's give any holes
			a wide berth.
