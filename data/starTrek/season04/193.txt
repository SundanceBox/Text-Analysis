			-- You were like a brother to
			me. We played in the park near
			the lake.
			Of course -- Every summer you
			came to Bergerac!
			You used to make swords out of
			the reeds -- And when you cut
			your hand, you would run to
			me, and I would say --
			"Let me see --"
			Oh! How did you do that?
			"Playing" near the Porte de
			Nesle.
			And how many were against you?
			No more than a hundred.
			Tell me!
			No... Let it go. You tell me
			what you were going to say. Do
			you dare?
			I do dare... I love someone.
			Ah!
			But he does not know.
			Ah!
			Not yet. He is proud, noble,
			brave and beautiful --
			Beautiful!
			What's the matter?
			He is in the Guards?
			Since this morning. Baron
			Christien de Neuvillette. In your
			own regiment.
			Ah...
			Promise to be his friend.
			I promise.
			And never let him fight a duel.
			God forbid.
			Oh, I love you.
			I must go now. You never told
			me what happened last night.
			And tell him to write me. A
			hundred men against one. To
			write, remember. A hundred men!
			What courage!
			Oh... I have done better since...
			Bravo.
			Wonderful.
			Lieutenant Barclay's performance
			was superficially adequate but
			clearly not rooted in The Method
			approach. As a result, his
			customary anxiety was evident.
			I do not understand why...
			-- Because it's polite, Data.
			Not a bad showing after only six
			weeks of lessons.
			Not a bad showing period.
			I... we have a very... patient
			teacher.
			There's an opening in my
			workshop... Worf.
			Well done.
			Thank... thank you...
			Counselor...
			You've come a long way, Reg.
			After... more rehearsals than I
			can count.
			I don't just mean your acting
			ability. It takes a great deal
			of courage to put yourself on
			display like that.
			You think so...
			There was a time when nothing
			could have dragged you onto a
			stage in front of an audience.
			You've made tremendous progress.
			I... I guess...
			Don't you think so?
			Well...
			I still feel more... more
			comfortable playing somebody else.
			Maybe all this is no better than
			escaping into a holodeck fantasy.
			I disagree. This isn't fantasy
			-- it's theatre. You used to
			withdraw into the holodeck. You
			isolated yourself inside your own
			imagination, avoiding contact with
			real people.
			Look at yourself now... and look
			at all the other people you're
			with... you're not just acting,
			you're inter-acting. Give
			yourself some credit, Mister
			Barclay!
			Maybe... you're right.
			Captain's log, stardate 44704.2.
			We have arrived at the Argus
			Array, the remote subspace
			telescope at the very edge of
			Federation space.
			The unmanned structure
			mysteriously stopped relaying its
			data nearly two months ago.
			The fusion reactors that power
			the array are extremely unstable.
			The risk of overload is high.
			What about the computer systems?
			They do not seem to be functioning
			at all.
			Captain! I am picking up an
			unidentified device! One point
			eight kilometers from the array!
			Onscreen.
			Magnify.
			Some kind of probe. I'll bet
			that's what damaged the array.
			Is it emitting any signals,
			Lieutenant?
			Negative, sir. I show no
			activity.
			Mister La Forge, why don't you
			go out and take a closer look.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Barclay, report to
			Main Shuttlebay.
			Enterprise, this is Shuttle Five,
			in position. Ready to begin
			short-range scan.
			Proceed, Shuttle Five.
			Let's start with the passive high
			res series.
			Electromagnetic band?
			Give it a try.
			I'm picking up visual wavelengths
			only. Between forty-five...
			forty-five hundred and seven
			thousand angstroms.
			Try the neutron densitometer.
			Nothing.
			Hmmmm. Doesn't seem to want to
			give up any secrets. Let's go
			to active scan.
			No... No modulation.
			You are definitely not from our
			neighborhood.
			Increase to three point zero.
			Commander?
			Yeah, Reg?
			Thanks for... for assigning me
			to this mission.
			Don't mention it. You're one of
			my top engineers. It's about time
			you started to do the interesting
			stuff.
			This is why I'm in Starfleet.
			Still no modulation.
			Hit it with the positron emission.
			What was that?
			Our computer is down!
			Reg! Reg!
			Captain's log, supplemental. An
			intense energy surge from the
			alien probe has severly disabled
			the shuttle's onboard computer.
			The away team has been transported
			directly to Sickbay.
			Any indication of the probe's
			energy source, Data?
			No sir. Power emissions do not
			match any known radiation
			patterns. We have not encountered
			this technology before.
			Very well. Isolate the probe and
			place it in tow. We'll take it
			to Science Station Four-Oh-Two
			in the Kohlan system...
			Captain. The probe has begun to
			move. It is approaching the
			Enterprise.
			Shields up!
			Aye, sir.
			There was enough energy in that
			flash to overload your optic
			nerves. It knocked you
			unconscious.
			My VISOR must have filtered it
			out.
			Exactly.
			Well, there's no apparent retinal
			damage and the cornea looks fine.
			But I'm still waiting for the full
			sero-amino readout. I'll call
			you when it comes in.
			You shouldn't have to... wait so
			long for the results...
			What do you mean?
			Couldn't you use a global mode
			in your scanner... It would be
			a lot faster.
			That's not possible.
			These are human cells we're
			talking about, not isolinear
			circuits.
			You'd better stick to engineering.
			The cells have a... an
			electromagnetic signature... just
			like a circuit element does...
			Conceptually, it should work...
			with a few adjustments...
			I could set it up for you if you'd
			like...
			Probe now closing at fifteen
			point three meters per second.
			Collision course.
			Captain, sensors are reading no
			particulate emissions or subspace
			field distortions.
			Then how is it able to move?
			The method of propulsion is
			unknown.
			Ensign, take us away from it.
			One quarter impulse.
			Aye, Sir.
			The probe is matching our speed
			and course.
			Captain, an energy field is
			forming around the device.
			Intensity is three point two
			terawatts, and increasing.
			Sir, the shuttlecraft shields did
			not provide sufficent protection
			for its computer. Our computer
			may also be vulnerable. I
			recommend withdrawal to a safe
			distance.
			Ensign Anaya, full about, go to
			one-half impulse.
			One-half impulse.
			The probe is following.
			Options, Number One?
			We can't use photon torpedoes.
			An explosion this close to the
			ship could cripple us.
			Sir, recommend full phasers.
			Proceed.
			Firing phasers.
			No effect, Captain.
			The probe's field intensity is
			continuing to build... we are in
			danger, Captain...
			Riker to La Forge. Can you
			increase phaser power?
			Attempting to now, Commander.
			Isolate phasers eighty through
			one twenty and shunt all plasma...
			... to the emitters, yessir, I'm
			already on it... ready.
			Captain! Phasers are as hot as
			we can make them!
			Mister Worf.
			Aye, sir.
			Nothing.
			Go to warp two.
			Aye, sir.
			Warp two.
			The probe is still with us, sir.
			At warp two?
			Yessir.
			Captain. The probe's energy
			output is overloading our shields.
			Failure anticipated in forty-seven
			seconds.
			I'm willing to entertain
			suggestions...
			Captain! We're dropping to
			impulse.
			Commander, warp power has been
			transferred to the shield grid.
			Barclay, what are you doing?
			Lieutenant Barclay to Captain
			Picard. You can fire photon
			torpedos. Maximum yield, full
			spread.
			We're too close.
			Our shields will hold.
			La Forge?
			I don't know how Barclay did it,
			but shield strength has been
			increased by over three hundred
			percent. It should be enough.
			Mister Worf. Photon torpedos.
			Maximum yield, full spread.
			Aye.
			Thank you, Mister Barclay...
			You're welcome, Captain. Barclay
			out.
			I'm sorry if I overstepped my
			authority.
			Don't mention it...
			Captain's log, stardate 44705.3.
			The Enterprise has destroyed the
			alien probe. But now we are left
			with the difficult task of
			repairing the Argus Telescope.
			Failure to do so would represent
			an irreplaceable scientific loss.
			Mister Barclay.
			... Everyone's still trying to
			figure out exactly how you did
			it.
			It... it just occurred to me that
			I could set up a frequency
			harmonic between the deflector
			and the shield grid... using the
			warp field generator as a power
			flow anti-attenuator and that of
			course naturally created an
			amplification of the inherent
			energy output. (TECH?)
			Uh huh.
			Nice job.
			Mister Barclay, I'm glad you could
			join us.
			Your report, Mister La Forge.
			Each of the telescope's subspace
			antenna clusters is powered by
			its own fusion reactor. But a
			single computer controls them all.
			So, all eighteen reactors were
			affected when the computer was
			damaged... ?
			They're starting to overload, and
			could eventually go critical.
			If that happens, the explosion
			would destroy the Array. And I
			wouldn't want to be next door if
			that happens.
			A standard isolation procedure
			would be advisable.
			I agree. We'll cut off each
			reactor from the damaged control
			system and repair them one by one.
			How long will that take?
			Two, three weeks -- at least.
			Alright then, Mister La Forge --
			I don't agree.
			We could repair all the reactors
			simultaneously instead of one by
			one.
			Simultaneously? All eighteen?
			Yessir.
			But the Argus computer is
			inoperable.
			Not entirely. The core memory
			is still intact. We could program
			a completely new control system.
			That is an interesting suggestion,
			Lieutenant. However, such an
			approach would require more time
			than our original plan, at least
			seven weeks.
			-- I can have it ready in two
			days.
			What?
			If you could assist me in the
			morning, Commander...
			Sure, Reg.
			The moon -- yes, that will be my
			home. My paradise. I shall find
			there, all the souls I love --
			Socrates, Galileo...
			"But what the devil is he doing
			among us?"
			Philosopher. Scientist. Poet,
			musician, duellist -- Here lies
			Hercule-Savinien De Cyrano de
			Bergerac.
			I would not have you weep any
			less for that charming, good,
			handsome Christien. I only ask
			this: that as the great cold
			surrounds my bones, you allow a
			double meaning to your mourning
			veil. And when your tears fall
			for him, some few will be... for
			me.
			That was... a real improvement.
			Thank you, Doctor. Same time day
			after tomorrow?
			Same time...
			May I join you?
			Of course. Please... Sit down,
			Counselor.
			Hard at work?
			Getting prepared for tomorrow's
			meeting in Engineering. We're
			planning our repair strategy.
			I enjoyed the scene you just
			performed.
			You're a very forgiving audience.
			Not at all.
			I thought you were brilliant.
			You've... changed.
			Is that a professional opinion?
			Pure observation.
			It's true. I can't explain it.
			But in the last few days I've
			found a confidence that I never
			knew was there.
			I'm proud of you, Reg... and I'm
			glad for you, too.
			Well, I'd better be going.
			Must you?
			I... think so...
			Wouldn't you like to take a walk
			with me through the arboretum?
			The zalnias should be in bloom...
			Reg, as your former counselor...
			I... don't think it would be
			appropriate...
			-- I don't need a counselor. What
			I need is the company of a
			charming, intelligent woman.
			Goodnight, Mister Barclay.
			Where's Lieutenant Barclay?
			I stopped by his quarters on my
			way over. He wasn't there.
			Computer, location of Lieutenant
			Barclay.
			Holodeck Three.
			G sub I J of t as t approaches
			infinity...
			That's G of t over G-naught.
			So it is, so it is.
			I still don't see how you can
			incorporate the quantum principle
			into general relativity without
			adjusting the cosmological
			constant a lot more than you're
			doing here.
			If we increase the value as you
			suggest, we must face the
			possibility of twenty-six
			dimensions, instead of ten!
			I'm not sure if I'm ready for
			that.
			I certainly am not.
			But if this semiset was curved
			into the subatomic, the infinities
			might cancel each other out.
			Gruss Gott. They just might.
			We had a meeting at Oh-seven
			hundred...
			I'm sorry, Commander.
			Thank you, Professor.
			End program.
			What was that all about?
			I had some ideas late last
			night... I needed to consult the
			computer about some quantum
			electrodynamic calculations. A
			holodeck Einstein program seemed
			like the best way. I guess I went
			a little overboard.
			A little? Most of the stuff on
			that blackboard was way out of
			my league. Yours too.
			Not really. I just never thought
			along those lines before. It's
			all pretty evident now... I'm sure
			if you put your mind to it --
			-- Ever since our run-in with the
			probe, something's been different
			about you.
			Because I'm starting to behave
			a little more like the rest of
			the crew? With confidence in what
			I'm doing?
			You just spent the entire night
			arguing Grand Unification Theories
			with Albert Einstein!
			Yes, but --
			-- Something's happened to you,
			Reg. We can't ignore that.
			I've finally become the person
			I've always wanted to be. Do we
			have to ask why?
			Yeah, I think we do...
			Incredible. The production of
			neurotransmitters in your brain
			has jumped by over five hundred
			percent. Pre and postsynaptic
			membranes have increased their
			permeability to match it.
			I couldn't even guess at an I.Q.
			level.
			Probably somewhere between twelve
			hundred and fourteen fifty.
			But that isn't all.
			The corpus callosum -- the
			connecting bridge between the two
			sides of the brain. It's so
			active that the hemispheres have
			essentially become one.
			So it's not just raw intelligence
			we're talking about.
			Creativity, imagination,
			resourcefulness, inspiration --
			it's all been enhanced.
			Lieutenant, you are the most
			advanced human being who has ever
			lived.
			Captain's log; supplemental.
			Apparently as a result of his
			exposure to the alien probe,
			Lieutenant Barclay has gained an
			extraordinary new level of
			intelligence. The question now
			is -- how are we to deal with it?
			We could confine him to his
			quarters.
			How can we do that? What's he
			done? You're talking about
			locking him up for being too
			smart.
			If he's under an alien influence,
			doesn't that put us all at risk?
			Not necessarily. For all we know
			it could be more like a simple
			allergic reaction to a bee
			sting...
			Has Mister Barclay done anything
			that could be considered
			potentially threatening?
			He did make a pass at me last
			night.
			A good one.
			I wouldn't exactly call that a
			threat.
			No, but it's definitely unusual
			behavior for Barclay.
			He taught violin technique at the
			music school last night.
			I didn't know Barclay even played
			the violin.
			He didn't... until last night.
			Look... if we want to save the
			Array, we need Barclay... It's
			as simple as that...
			Until he does something more
			menacing than what's been
			described -- I see no reason why
			we should prevent him from
			continuing his work.
			Larson to Commander La Forge.
			Go ahead, Lieutenant.
			We're having trouble containing
			reactor nine, sir. It's starting
			to chain.
			I'll be right there.
			You said he made a pass... you
			forgot to mention whether it was
			successful or not...
			Thermal levels up one hundred
			seventy seven percent. Comparable
			increase in neutron emissions.
			Is the interface between our
			computer and the Array still in
			operation?
			Yes.
			But our computer is just too slow
			to direct the repairs; the
			parameters are changing too
			quickly for it to keep up.
			We'll have to try a remote
			shutdown from here.
			Transmitting commands to the Array
			now, Sir. Starting close down
			sequence.
			Brower, increase the intake of
			liquid Helium Three into the
			reactor wall. We've got to cool
			it off.
			Transmitting commands...
			Thermal levels increasing!
			What happened?
			Unclear... the interface isn't
			fast enough.
			Commander La Forge! Overload
			indications on Argus generator
			Five...
			Seven and Fourteen.
			Damn.
			Can't do anything from here...
			I've got to have a better
			interface...
			La Forge to Bridge. We're looking
			at a cascade reactor failure on
			the Argus.
			I don't think we're gonna pull
			this one out.
			Reactor Nine will reach critical
			in ten minutes, forty three
			seconds. The subsequent explosion
			will create a chain reaction along
			the entire length of the Array.
			La Forge. You've got ten minutes.
			Ensign, standby for a jump to warp
			two.
			Yes, Sir.
			Mister Worf, Red Alert.
			Aye, Commander.
			Computer.
			Standing by.
			Begin new program. Create as
			follows: Work station chair.
			Create a standard alpha-numeric
			console positioned for left hand.
			... Now, an iconic display console
			positioned for right hand.
			Tie both consoles into the
			Enterprise main computer core,
			utilizing a neural scan interface.
			There is no such device on file.
			No problem. Here's how you build
			it...
			Argus Reactor Nine is twenty-eight
			seconds to critical.
			Let's get out of here.
			Warp two, Ensign.
			Yes, Sir.
			Helm is not responding.
			Captain! We have lost computer
			control!
			What?
			Twelve seconds to critical, Sir...
			Go to manual.
			I'm attempting to, sir... but
			it's...
			There's not enough time...
			The computer is coming back on
			line, sir.
			Captain, the Argus reactors are
			shutting down.
			We are no longer in danger.
			What happened?
			Unknown, sir...
			La Forge, what did you do?
			Wasn't me, sir.
			Computer, how were the Argus
			reactors shut down?
			A neural interface was created
			to expedite the repairs.
			Barclay?
			Computer! Respond.
			I am responding, sir. I'm sorry
			if I caused you any alarm. It
			was necessary in order to secure
			the Array.
			Barclay?
			Yes, Commander...
			It's me...
			I was only trying to help. Our
			computer was too slow to
			compensate for the overload on
			the Array. So I created an
			interface that communicated my
			thoughts directly to the central
			processing unit.
			Exactly what does that mean?
			My body is as you see it here.
			But much of my higher brain
			functions and memory have been
			transferred to the starboard
			computer core.
			Mister Barclay, please remove
			yourself from the computer system
			and leave the holodeck.
			I'm afraid I can't, Sir.
			Why is that?
			My primary cerebral functions
			are now operating almost entirely
			from within the computer. They
			have expanded to such a degree
			that it would be impossible to
			return to the confines of my
			human brain.
			Any attempt to do so would mean
			my death.
			That's it.
			I disconnected the visual and
			audio pickups. We can talk
			without being monitored by...
			the computer...
			By Barclay.
			Report, Commander.
			It's now almost impossible to tell
			where Barclay ends and the
			computer begins. He's actually
			rewriting the isolinear chips each
			time he extends himself a little
			further.
			How do we get him out of there?
			We don't. Not without killing
			him.
			This is an intolerable
			situation... I have no wish to
			harm him, but we cannot allow
			Mister Barclay to continue to act
			as the ship's computer... I don't
			care how smart he is.
			Lieutenant Barclay has not yet
			extended himself into the
			Engineering subsystems. It may
			be possible to establish an ODN
			bypass directly to the Bridge.
			That won't give us control of
			the ship.
			No... But we would have access
			to the propulsion systems. Enough
			to get us to the nearest
			Starbase.
			How long would it take to set
			it up?
			A few hours.
			Make it so.
			Should we... discuss this with
			Barclay, Captain?
			I think not.
			Commander La Forge?
			Yeah, Reg?
			I thought you would be in your
			quarters.
			Just catching up on some work.
			That level-3 diagnostic we
			talked about.
			How're you doing?
			I wish I could convey to you what
			it's like for me now. What I've
			become...
			Give it a try.
			I can conceive almost infinite
			possibilities, and can fully
			explore each of them in a
			nanosecond. I perceive the
			universe as a single equation,
			and it is so simple, I...
			understand...
			Understand?
			...everything.
			Do you understand how this
			happened to you?
			I believe it is a gift... that
			I have been chosen to fulfill a
			great purpose...
			Uh huh.
			Do you suppose all this has
			changed the way people think about
			me?
			I'll be honest with you. We don't
			know what to think.
			I've been concerned about that.
			But soon everyone will
			understand what I can do for
			humanity.
			They will... ?
			We have always perceived the
			maximum speed of the Enterprise
			as a function of warp... but I
			know now there are no limits...
			We will explore new worlds that
			we could never before have reached
			in our lifetime. I will take us
			to them...
			Captain! I am picking up a
			subspace distortion.
			Mister Data?
			This disturbance is the result
			of a highly charged graviton field
			emanating from our warp nacelles.
			It is creating a severe bias in
			the subspace continuum.
			Lieutenant Barclay, are you
			responsible for this graviton
			field disturbance?
			Yessir, I'm altering subspace
			in a way that's never been
			conceived of before. I'm fairly
			certain it will allow us to travel
			half-way across the galaxy in a
			matter of only...
			Mister Barclay, I'd like you to
			hold off on this experiment for
			now.
			Captain, if you'd only allow
			me...
			Lieutenant, this is a direct
			order. Discontinue whatever it
			is you're doing.
			I really would rather not, sir.
			I'm positive you'll be pleased
			with the result once I've
			finished.
			Audio is disconnected. We may
			speak freely.
			How soon before the ODN bypass
			is in place?
			I have been monitoring Commander
			La Forge's progress. It will
			be operational in approximately
			seventeen minutes.
			Captain, let me go to the
			holodeck. Try to talk to him.
			Sir, the subspace distortion is
			continuing to increase...
			Hello, Deanna.
			Reg...
			I'm sorry that we can't take that
			walk in the Arboretum.
			So am I.
			Reg, you've frightened everyone...
			I can't imagine that is your
			intent.
			Young children are sometimes
			frightened of the world. That
			doesn't mean their parents should
			let them stay in their cribs.
			Are we children to you, now?
			I can see so much more than you
			are capable of. You should trust
			that.
			Deanna, I've always wanted to earn
			your respect.
			You've got it... From all of us.
			We don't need any more convincing.
			Please obey the Captain's
			orders... stop whatever you're
			doing...
			You must trust me...
			How are we to trust an officer
			who doesn't follow orders... ?
			Trust me...
			The Captain will do everything
			in his power to stop you.
			Picard to La Forge. Status?
			Ready now, Captain.
			Proceed.
			Acknowledged.
			Commander?
			What.
			You're too late.
			Captain, the ODN bypass to the
			Bridge has been blocked. We have
			not regained control of the
			propulsion systems.
			Barclay!
			Yes, Commander Riker?
			Shut that thing down!
			Captain. We are going in.
			Mister Barclay!
			Respond at once!
			Audio is disconnected.
			Lieutenant, take a security team
			to Holodeck Three.
			Disconnect Mister Barclay from
			the computer.
			Aye, Captain.
			I want you to know, Lieutenant
			Worf, that I understand your duty
			in this matter...
			Phasers. Maximum setting
			... and that I in no way will take
			your actions personally.
			The conduits.
			Fire.
			La Forge! Initiate stabilization
			procedure!
			Resetting stabilizers to match
			subspace flow matrix... stand
			by...
			Mister Data... ?
			We are experiencing a quantum
			level oscillation delay...
			Doubling in intensity, every
			twelve point three seconds...
			He is protected by a force
			field... we could not disconnect
			him.
			Data, how long can we take this?
			Bio-cellular disruption is
			imminent.
			Sir!
			Where are we, Ensign?
			Unless something is wrong with
			the sensors... We're almost
			thirty thousand light years from
			where we were.
			The center of the galaxy.
			Sir, our heading has been altered.
			Approaching a planetary cluster.
			Captain, all systems are back
			under helm control. The computer
			has resumed normal functioning.
			Captain!
			Emotive. Electro-chemical
			stimulus-response.
			Cranial plate.
			Bipedal locomotion. Endoskeletal.
			Contiguous external integument.
			I am Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of
			the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			Hierarchical collective command
			structure!
			Who are you?
			Interrogative.
			Yes. I am interrogative... And
			I would appreciate an
			explanation...
			I believe I can help with that,
			Captain.
			Mister Barclay. I thought it
			would be fatal if you left the
			holodeck.
			The Cytherians have reintegrated
			me, sir.
			Cytherians.
			The probe was designed to instruct
			outsiders on how to reach this
			system. But the technologies
			aren't always compatible. It
			failed with the Argus computer,
			and with the computer on the
			shuttle. But it was able to
			reprogram... me.
			What do you want of us?
			The same as you.
			Mister Barclay... ?
			You both have the same mission,
			Captain...
			Mission... ?
			Yessir. The Cytherians are
			exploring the galaxy just as we
			are... The difference is they
			never leave their home -- they
			bring others here. They only wish

			Captain's log, stardate 44721.9.
			The Cytherians have returned the
			Enterprise to Federation space.
			We bring back knowledge of their

			You almost always feel a sense
			of loss. But it's possible to
			carry something of that experience
			through the rest of your life --
			in ways that you're not even aware
			of now.

			tackling that level-3
			diagnostic...

			a date scheduled for a walk in
			the Arboretum... ?

			this, you know...
			I know.
			May I?

			I didn't know you played chess.
			I don't.
