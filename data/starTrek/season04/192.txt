			Tarchannen Three Investigation.
			Stardate 40164.7. Ensign Anthony
			Brevelle Recording. Lieutenant
			Susanna Leijten in command.
			You up and running, Brevelle?
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			I've checked buildings Four and
			Five... they're like all the
			others... no phaser hits, no sign
			of a fight. Looks like the entire
			outpost just... vanished...
			Lieutenant Leijten...
			You'd better come see this...
			No footprints... no vehicle
			tracks. The wind probably erased
			them... but look...
			Freeze visual.
			That's Hickman on the right...
			that's Mendez on the left...
			and as already noted, the
			recording was made by Ensign
			Brevelle... five years ago...
			Commander Leijten, you said
			Brevelle was ill last week for
			several days before he...
			deserted. What about Mendez?
			Mendez was last seen aboard the
			Aries an hour before she
			disappeared. According to
			witnesses, she seemed completely
			normal.
			And Hickman?
			He just passed a routine
			physical... with flying colors.
			I know Paul Hickman. He's a
			family man... two kids. I can't
			believe he'd steal a shuttle and
			desert...
			Believe it, Geordi. He was
			spotted by a Federation supply
			ship yesterday... on a course
			toward Tarchannen Three.
			The original Tarchannen
			disapperances were never solved,
			were they?
			No... we never learned what
			happened or why. Forty-nine
			people... gone...
			And now, five years later, members
			of the away team that investigated
			the disappearances... have started
			disappearing themselves.
			Geordi and I are the only two
			left.
			Captain's log, Stardate 44664.5.
			We have set a course to intercept
			Lieutenant Hickman's stolen
			shuttlecraft... and, hopefully,
			to discover the whereabouts of
			the other missing officers...
			And then I almost married Paul
			Bogrow...
			Bogrow... which one was he?
			You remember... with the thin
			moustache...
			Not Bogrow...
			I know.
			The one who used to drive you
			crazy... you thought he was so
			full of himself...
			Well, I decided I prejudged him
			unfairly...
			Uh huh...
			And then I decided I'd been right
			in the first place.
			Bogrow...
			And what about you... how come
			you never found the right girl?
			I enjoy the bachelor's life too
			much...
			That doesn't sound like my "little
			brother" who always wanted advice
			on women...
			Well, you were obviously a great
			advisor...
			What do you think, Suz?
			I don't know. But I'm not ashamed
			to tell you...
			I'm a little scared, you know?
			Yeah, I know.
			Well, if anybody's gonna figure
			this out, it'll be the Leitjen
			and La Forge Show, right? We
			always made a good team...
			A helluva team...
			Commander La Forge, Commander
			Leijten, report to the Bridge.
			We have a fix on the missing
			shuttle.
			On our way, Commander.
			Entering the Tarchannen system,
			sir.
			Slow to impulse power. Mister
			Worf?
			Long range sensors holding on the
			shuttlecraft... bearing zero one
			zero, mark two seven one.
			Hail the vessel.
			Lieutenant Hickman is not
			responding, sir.
			Put a repeating message on all
			sub-space channels. Make it a
			Priority One communique -- order
			the Lieutenant to come about and
			stand to.
			Still no response, sir.
			The craft is now within visual
			range.
			On screen.
			The shuttle's acceleration is
			increasing... its trajectory is
			moving directly into the
			planet's atmosphere.
			He will reach an atmospheric
			interface at an altitude of two
			hundred and ten kilometers.
			At his current speed, he'll
			self-destruct.
			That is correct, Commander.
			How soon, Data?
			Fifty-three seconds.
			Options?
			He's out of transporter range.
			And he's too far away for a
			positive lock with the tractor
			beam.
			Open a channel.
			Open.
			Lieutenant Hickman, listen
			carefully. I am Captain Picard
			of the Enterprise. You are in
			danger. You must slow your rate
			of approach.
			The shuttle is approaching the
			outer thermosphere, Captain.
			He's panicking...
			At current rate of acceleration,
			the shuttlecraft will be destroyed
			in twenty-eight seconds.
			Sixteen seconds to impact.
			Lieutenant Hickman, you must do
			as I tell you. Reduce your
			velocity and bring your craft to
			a positive pitch of twenty
			degrees... now.
			The shuttle is entering the lower
			ionosphere...
			Sir, sensors detect two more
			Federation shuttlecraft on the
			planet's surface... no life signs.
			Ready an away team, Number One.
			Geordi, Data, Worf...
			And Commander Leijten.
			Commander Leijten, La Forge, check
			the shuttle... Worf, Data, you've
			got the perimeter.
			It's the shuttle pod Mendez stole
			from the Aries...
			No life signs, sir.
			Sir... I am certain that we are
			being watched.
			Commander Riker...
			Where's Commander Leijten?
			Susanna, report.
			Fan out. Let's find her.
			Susanna?
			La Forge to Leijten...
			Over here...
			Where have you been?
			Mendez... Brevelle... they're
			alive. You saw the footprints?
			Yes... but they're not human...
			They're here. Stand still...
			listen... and you can feel it...
			they're here...
			I'm not picking up anything...
			Where are you going?
			Susanna... ?
			La Forge to Enterprise, medical
			emergency, two to Sickbay.
			Do I look as bad as I feel?
			You look fine... now.
			What happened?
			Your blood chemistry is way off.
			And you had a histamine response,
			to what I don't know.
			I'll run a complete blood and
			tissue analysis.
			I need to get back to the surface.
			Uh uh... until we find some
			answers, I don't want you to leave
			the Enterprise.
			But I have work...
			Look, Commander, you may simply
			have had an anxiety reaction down
			there. But we've got to make
			sure.
			Probably wouldn't hurt to take
			it easy for a while...
			I'm not going to stay locked up
			on this ship while the
			investigation...
			Your devotion to duty is
			admirable, Commander... but Doctor
			Crusher is right. You will remain
			on the Enterprise until we know
			whether or not this is connected
			to the disappearance of the
			others.
			Captain...
			We have completed our survey on
			the surface. Analyzing that data
			will keep all of us busy for some
			time.
			Of course, sir. I understand.
			Data has a preliminary report...
			if you feel up to it...
			Sure... what're we waiting for?
			Doctor... what about La Forge?
			I gave him a complete bioscan.
			Everything says he's in perfect
			shape.
			But according to all reports...
			so were Mendez and Hickman before
			they disappeared.
			Captain Picard's wrong. The way
			to handle this is to get back down
			there with a dozen away teams...
			fan out from the shuttle... We
			can cover a lot of ground in a
			hurry... use proximity detectors
			and infrared sensors...
			Susanna...
			Geordi... it's started...
			whatever happened to the others...
			it's happening to me, too...
			Suz... I'm here...
			I'm not going to let anything
			happen to you.
			Main Bridge.
			During microscopic examination
			of the torn uniform, I discovered
			these alien skin cells.
			Source?
			Undetermined.
			Without something else to
			cross-reference, it would take
			weeks to try and identify them...
			Fortunately, there is more
			evidence...
			We have been able to determine
			that the footprints we found by
			the shuttle were not made by any
			known Tarchannen life form.
			If we're pursuing a theory that
			somehow unknown aliens are
			involved... I should tell you we
			didn't find tracks like that
			during the original investigation.
			The planet is subject to frequent
			sandstorms. Footprints could have
			been obliterated prior to your
			arrival.
			Doctor Crusher and I will begin
			to search the medical database...
			and attempt to match these with
			a known life form.
			Aliens or no aliens... why would
			our people start returning after
			five years to be... abducted?
			Some kind of compulsion... like
			a post hypnotic command... ?
			Something that happened while we
			were down there the first time...
			We can go back to the mission
			record... construct a log of
			everyone's movements...
			And look for a commonalty.
			Something we all touched... maybe
			a plant... the sand...
			Or something we ingested... could
			be in the air itself...
			The parameters are pretty broad,
			Data... any match we make is going
			to be inconclusive at best.
			I am aware of that. However, I
			see no other reasonable course
			of investigation available to us.
			And we may not have much time.
			You're worried about Geordi,
			aren't you?
			I am an android. It is not
			possible for me to feel anxiety.
			Starfleet personnel have
			vanished... others may be at risk.
			We must do the best we can to find
			out why.
			However...
			I am strongly motivated to solve
			this mystery.
			Freeze visual.
			We're wasting our time.
			You didn't feel that way before...
			it was your idea to look for some
			sort of commonality.
			Well... I was wrong.
			We're not going to find anything
			this way. We should go back to
			the planet... it's all down
			there... everything we need to
			know.
			That's not an option... not until
			the Captain says it is...
			Computer resume.
			I can't look at this anymore.
			It hurts my eyes... I can't think.
			My brain feels like it's wrapped
			in a blanket.
			Take a break. I'll work for a...
			I don't need a break... I...
			... I need to get off this ship.
			I think... we should go see Doctor
			Crusher...
			Forget Crusher... forget your
			logs. Tarchannen's down there,
			Geordi. It's waiting for us.
			That's where we should go.
			Susanna... you can't leave...
			Susanna...
			SUSANNA!
			Her blood pressure's still
			falling...
			Apply the T-cell stimulator.
			We've got to stabilize her immune
			system.
			She's developed an extreme
			sensitivity to light... we're
			trying to make her more
			comfortable.
			My God...
			Geordi...
			Hold on, Susanna. Doctor Crusher
			will help you. Just... hold on.
			It's inside me, Geordi... I can't
			fight it... it's winning...
			Don't give up... do you hear me,
			Suz? You can't give up...
			This is one of Susanna's altered
			skin cells...
			And this is one of the alien cells
			Data found.
			Almost identical. How do you
			explain it?
			Captain, I think the people who
			disappeared from Tarchannen Three
			weren't abducted... they were
			transformed into another
			species...
			Can you stop it, Doctor?
			The T-cell stimulator will slow
			the rate of change... but until I
			find the cause...
			Doctor Crusher... is this a threat
			to the Enterprise?
			No. I've tested the cell wall
			integrity. It's viability is
			extremely low. It's not possible
			for Susanna to transmit it.
			Then how did she get it?
			That's a good question. And it
			would be a great help if I knew.
			The only thing I do know,
			Geordi... is that it's very
			possible you'll be next.
			I had two full bioscans today.
			You said I was fine.
			I gave Susanna a bioscan, too.
			I didn't find anything wrong with
			her, either.
			How long?
			I don't know what we're dealing
			with. Brevelle was sick for days
			before he left... Mendez was
			normal an hour before she
			disappeared. You may have
			weeks... or just a few hours.
			Then there's no time to waste.
			I've got to get back to work.
			Geordi... until I know exactly
			what we're dealing with, you're
			staying here. In Sickbay.
			Doctor, you said it would help
			if you knew the source of this...
			If I could finish my analysis of
			the mission records... I might
			find an answer.
			And what if you begin to change...
			and feel compelled to return to
			the planet like the others?
			Program the computer to monitor
			my movements... that way you can
			be sure I don't leave the ship.
			What would you do, sir? Sit it
			out in Sickbay... or try to learn
			what it is that's got you... and
			maybe stop it?
			All right, Mister La Forge...
			proceed with your investigation.
			But report to Doctor Crusher for
			another bioscan at the start of
			day watch.
			In the meantime, if you have
			symptoms of any kind -- I want
			to know. Immediately.
			Understood.
			One to transport.
			I want to make another sweep of
			the perimeter. Mendez, Brevelle,
			start at Building Two. La Forge,
			you and I will begin at Four.
			Okay, computer...
			Analyze audio elements from time
			index fourteen four seven to
			fifteen five eight. List all
			anomalies.
			No audio anomalies present.
			Any subspace projections... z
			particle emissions... or
			interferometric frequencies?
			No subspace projections present.
			No z particle emissions present.
			No interferometric patterns
			present.
			Geordi... may I inquire how your
			investigation is proceeding?
			It's not.
			Have you done an audio analysis...
			And a spectrographic analysis and
			a screen for ionizing radiation...
			and I even ran an enhancement for
			micro-seismic disturbances. I've
			tried it all.
			I'm sorry, Data.
			There is no need for an apology.
			Perhaps if you indulged in a short
			rest period, you could approach
			this problem with what humans
			commonly refer to as a fresh point
			of view...
			You're probably right, Data. But
			I've got to finish scanning these
			records... while I can.
			Is there some way I can assist
			you?
			If I knew what I was looking
			for...
			I think it's just down to going
			over it, Data... maybe find
			something I forgot... I'll let
			you know if I come up with
			anything... anything at all.
			Sorry to disturb you, Doctor...
			It's alright. What's happened?
			I thought you should see this.
			Her skin's simulating the light...
			a radiant reaction...
			Some sort of mimetic ability?
			That's not all. Her body
			temperature is dropping.
			It's as if she's generating a
			disruptive field... I can barely
			get readings off her now... What
			about her rate of transformation?
			It's increasing.
			That's not possible. It should
			have been inhibited by the
			T-cell stimulator... unless...
			If there's a foreign body inside
			her that's producing these
			changes... something like a
			viral creche...
			A very small one if our scans
			haven't found it.
			I want a full genetic analysis.
			We're going to examine any
			abnormality we find... no matter
			how insignificant it seems.
			One to transport.
			Computer, delete the audio.
			Wait a minute... freeze visual.
			Whose shadow is that?
			Please restate question.
			Computer... the shadow currently
			displayed in section B-eleven...
			what is its source?
			Unknown.
			It's gotta belong to somebody...
			Computer... return to time index
			fourteen five eight...
			Okay... Brevelle's behind the
			camera... Susanna and I head off
			in that direction. Mendez moves
			off that way...
			... so whose shadow is it?
			Computer... replay visual from
			last time index. No audio.
			Slow to fifty percent.
			Freeze visual.
			Magnify four times... apply
			spectral enhancement.
			Computer, do you have sufficient
			data to compile a Holographic
			simulation of this Visual Record?
			A simulation would be limited to
			areas scanned by the visual
			recording device.
			Good. Fine. Scan the entire
			record... then recreate it in
			Holodeck Three.
			Computer, is the Tarchannen
			simulation ready?
			Affirmative. Program complete.
			Enter when ready.
			Computer, scan Starfleet records
			and create a simulation of
			Brevelle... place him where he
			stood while recording this...
			Good. Computer, based on their
			speed and direction, can you
			extrapolate each officer's
			movements as they walk out of
			the recording device's field of
			view?
			Affirmative. With an increasing
			probability of error, reaching
			ninety-five percent after ten
			seconds.
			Understood. Run simulation.
			I want to make another sweep of
			the perimeter. Mendez, Brevelle,
			start at Building Two. La Forge,
			you and I will begin at Four.
			It's happening too fast.
			Freeze program.
			Computer, reverse simulation...
			run it back to... time index
			fourteen five eight.
			Freeze.
			Computer... remove Leijten...
			Remove La Forge...
			... and now remove Mendez...
			Computer, using vector analysis,
			identify the source of this
			shadow.
			There is no object in the program
			which could generate the shadow.
			There must be something else
			here... something between the
			camera lights and the wall.
			Computer, given the distance from
			the lights to the wall... can you
			determine the most likely shape
			and position of the object casting
			this shadow?
			There is insufficient data to
			reconstruct the requested object.
			Okay... let's assume the height
			of our friend here is about my
			size... say one hundred seventy
			centimeters... now can you
			extrapolate its shape and
			position?
			Affirmative.
			Do it.
			There... in the thymus...
			Some kind of parasite. It's using
			Susanna's immune system to spread
			genetic instructions...
			How did it get there?
			She could have been infected
			during the original mission. It's
			small enough to have entered
			through any of the mucous
			membranes...
			But it certainly isn't acting like
			a typical parasite... it's not
			feeding off her -- it's actually
			transforming her DNA to match its
			own...
			There's not much of her original
			DNA left.
			And we're going to need unaltered
			genes... or we'll never get her
			back. We've got to get that thing
			out of her. Now.
			Any luck?
			Negative, Commander. Nothing in
			our survey suggests the source of
			a parasitic infection...
			Crusher to Bridge.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			The surgery was successful...
			... but it will be a few hours
			before we know how her
			regenerative systems are
			responding... In the meantime,
			I'd better get Geordi in here.
			Very good, Doctor. Keep us
			advised.
			Crusher to La Forge...
			Computer, locate Commander La
			Forge.
			Commander La Forge is not on board
			the Enterprise.
			Bridge, the Computer says Geordi
			isn't on board... ? Is that
			correct?
			I show no transporter activity.
			All shuttles are secure.
			Negative, Doctor. There is no
			indication he left the ship.
			Computer, what was Commander La
			Forge's last known location?
			Holodeck Three.
			Worf...
			Captain, if Geordi has
			transformed, he may be virtually
			a chameleon -- the skin develops
			mimetic capabilities... he could
			still be onboard...
			... but undetectable to our
			sensors...
			Search the structure... I will
			take the perimeter...
			Commander...
			Security...
			Captain... the security lockout
			on Transporter Room Six has been
			broken.
			Re-engage... now.
			I cannot, sir... The transport
			cycle has already begun.
			I do not read any life signs on
			the surface.
			Our sensor array is useless...
			we have to find another way of
			locating him.
			Captain, if we can get close
			enough to Geordi... we can read
			his absorption spectrum with an
			ultraviolet light.
			Can you modify an emergency beacon
			to operate on UV?
			Yes, sir.
			Make it so. Number One, as soon
			as Data is ready, I want you to
			lead an away team.
			How long, Mister Data?
			I still must replace the emitter
			module and reconnect the power
			supply. It will take
			approximately two minutes to
			complete the modification.
			Hedrick to Commander Riker.
			Go ahead.
			I've been able to determine La
			Forge's transport coordinates.
			He beamed down next to the Aries
			shuttle.
			Acknowledged.
			He's on foot... couldn't have
			gotten far by now. Let's assume
			a radius of ten kilometers...
			That is still a search area of
			more than three hundred square
			kilometers.
			We've got to narrow it down.
			What's happening with the enhanced
			sensor arrays?
			All scans are still negative.
			There has to be some way to track
			him.
			What about the high resolution
			EM scans?
			We are adjusting the sensors to
			read Commander La Forge's
			absorption spectrum... but it
			will take several hours.
			Geordi doesn't have several hours.
			I have completed the
			modifications, Commander.
			Doctor Crusher... meet us in
			Transporter Room Six.
			Immediately.
			... And I'm going to need a
			sedative for him... Get me ten
			cc's of kayolane...
			Doctor Crusher...
			You look a lot better than you
			did an hour ago...
			What did you do?
			We removed some kind of parasite
			from your thymus...
			No.
			It wasn't a parasite, Doctor.
			It's their method of
			reproduction... to plant a DNA
			strand in a living host... that
			causes a metamorphosis.
			... Geordi?
			He's gone...
			Yes...
			He's on the planet...
			Don't try to get up yet...
			We have to find him...
			An away team is about to start
			a search.
			You'll never be able to find
			him...
			I'm the only one who can.
			No... you must turn them off...
			the light frightens them...
			What about the ultraviolet?
			That is beyond their visual
			spectrum... they will not run from
			it.
			He could be several kilometers
			away by now.
			No... he's here... they're all
			here...
			There.
			Geordi...
			Geordi... stop...
			Wait here...
			Geordi, my voice is familiar...
			listen to it... you can feel that
			we share this... you know I am
			not a threat...
			The others... Mendez, Brevelle,
			they no longer exist as humans...
			but a part of you still does.
			You are not one of them... not
			yet. I can help you... if you'll
			just trust me...
			I know what's going on inside
			you... the war you're fighting
			with yourself... the humanity
			slipping away... the instinct to
			run... It's overpowering, but
			they know how to beat it now...
			Look at me... I've come back...
			Let me take you back, too.
			Just take my hand... please...
			Crusher to Enterprise. Lock on
			to Commander Leitjen's signal...
			prepare to transport two directly
			to Sickbay.
			We're going home, Geordi.
			Is there no hope for the others?
			Brevelle, Mendez...
			None.
			Susanna...
			I'm here, Geordi. So's Doctor
			Crusher and Captain Picard.
			Lieutenant Commander La Forge
			reporting for duty, Captain.
			Welcome back, Mister La Forge.
			This species... can we communicate
			with them?
			No. They act on instinct alone.
			In another few minutes, I wouldn't
			have responded to you at all,
			Susanna.
			Then we shall leave them be. I'll
			order warning beacons placed in
			orbit and on the surface.
			Hopefully, no one else will have
			to go through what you did.
			Down there, I didn't know who you
			were... and yet somehow I
			believed you... trusted you...
			Must've been all the good advice
			I used to give you...
			Thank you.
