			Captain's log: Stardate 44429.6.
			We are on a mapping survey near
			the Cardassian sector. It has
			been nearly a year since a peace
			treaty ended the long conflict
			between the Federation and
			Cardassia.
			Captain, we are nearing the
			periphery of Sector
			twenty-one-five-oh-three.
			Be on the lookout for a Cardassian
			patrol vessel, Mister Worf.
			They should be hailing us soon.
			Even with a treaty, they're
			skittish about protecting their
			borders.
			Last time I was in this sector,
			I was on the Stargazer, running
			at warp speed ahead of a
			Cardassian warship.
			Running, Captain? You? That's
			hard to believe...
			Believe it. I'd been sent to make
			preliminary overtures to a
			truce... I lowered my shields as
			a gesture of good will. But the
			Cardassians weren't impressed.
			They took out most of my weapons
			and damaged the impulse engines
			before I could regroup and run.
			The Cardassians have no honor.
			I do not trust them.
			They're our allies now, Worf.
			We have to trust them.
			Trust is earned, not given away.
			Well, I hope their scout vessel
			makes contact soon. It's not a
			good idea to stay too long on a
			Cardassian border without making
			your intentions known.
			What is it?
			Kelp buds... plankton loaf... and
			sea berries.
			Sweetheart... I'm not a fish.
			It's very healthy. I had this
			for breakfast every morning when
			I was growing up.
			No oatmeal -- or muffins? How
			about corned beef and eggs?
			For breakfast?
			Keiko, I've been thinking...
			You've introduced me to all the
			wonderful foods you're accustomed
			to... I'd like to do the same.
			Isn't that what marriage is about?
			Sharing?
			Like what kind of food?
			Scalloped potatoes... mutton
			shanks... oxtails and cabbage...
			Kind of... heavy...
			No, you'll love it, I promise.
			I can still remember the aromas
			when my mother was cooking...
			She cooked?
			She didn't believe in a
			replicator. She thought real food
			was more nutritious.
			She handled... real meat...
			touched it and cut it?
			Like a chef. She was fantastic.
			Of course, I'll have to use the
			replicator... but I'll make
			something special for you tonight.
			You'll love it, I promise.
			Okay. Maybe I'll have something
			special for you, tonight, too...
			Something's wrong...
			Red alert. Take emergency
			stations.
			Cardassian ship preparing to fire
			again, sir!
			Increase power to forward shields!
			Hail them again, Mister Worf.
			What is he doing? Damage report!
			Minor damage to secondary hull
			before we put our shields up, sir.
			No casualties, structural
			integrity intact.
			Engineering to Bridge... starboard
			power coupling is down...
			Evasive action -- Delta Sequence.
			Mister Worf, ready phasers.
			Delta Evasion Plan initiated...
			Mister Worf, limit targets to
			engines and shields...
			Aye sir... ready...
			Fire.
			Direct hit, sir. Moderate damage
			to their aft shield generators...
			Continue phaser fire.
			Multiple hits. Power failure
			in forward shields...
			Cardassian ship is standing down,
			sir.
			Let's see if they'll answer our
			hail now, Mister Worf.
			Frequency open, sir.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
			of the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian
			ship Trager.
			Why have you fired on us?
			A curious question. In war, one
			attacks one's enemies.
			There is a treaty between our
			people...
			Perhaps that fact was unknown to
			the Federation starship which
			destroyed our space station in
			the Cuellar System two days ago.
			A Federation starship... ?
			Attacked an unarmed science
			station. They had barely enough
			time to send an emergency
			signal... before they were
			incinerated.
			Gul Macet... the Federation and
			the Cardassians have struggled
			too hard for peace to abandon it
			so easily...
			We are not the ones who
			abandoned it, Captain.
			Let me talk to my superiors...
			find out what's behind this.
			Give me one hour. The alternative
			is for us to continue firing at
			each other. In such a contest,
			you would be at a disadvantage.
			Very well. One hour.
			We've confirmed the report,
			Captain. It was the starship
			Phoenix... under the command of
			Benjamin Maxwell.
			Ben Maxwell... he's one of
			Starfleet's finest Captains...
			he must have had provocation.
			I wish we knew. He's gone on
			silent running... doesn't answer
			our communiques.
			Then he's still in Cardassian
			space.
			The station he destroyed was in
			sector twenty-one-five-oh-five
			-- you're the nearest starship.
			We want you to go in and find
			him.
			Will the Cardassians
			cooperate... ?
			They've granted you safe
			passage... We've agreed that
			you'll take along a delegation
			of observers as a show of good
			faith.
			Jean-Luc... I don't have to tell
			you the Federation is not prepared
			for a new sustained conflict. You
			must preserve the peace... no
			matter what the cost. Haden out.
			... there will be three Cardassians
			transporting on board... Their
			Captain, Gul Macet and two of his
			aides.
			My intention is to be as open as
			possible with them... allow them
			to share in our search for the
			Phoenix.
			Sir, it is necessary to assign
			them a security detail.
			They will be our guests, Mister
			Worf. I don't want them to feel
			like prisoners.
			I'm inclined to agree with Worf,
			Captain. I would limit their
			access while they're on board.
			They don't need the run of the
			ship.
			I understand your concerns. And
			I realize... that we have had
			a long and difficult history with
			the Cardassians.
			However... it is not an
			exaggeration to say that the
			difference between peace... and
			war... is up to us. And the way
			we treat the Cardassians may make
			the difference.
			At least let me post guards at
			some of the sensitive areas of
			the ship.
			Very well, we will limit their
			access. But instruct your
			people... they are guests.
			Counselor, stay close to the
			crew. Some of them might be
			uncomfortable with the Cardassians
			on board. I want no incidents.
			Yes, Captain.
			Mister Data, is there anyone on
			board who served previously with
			Captain Benjamin Maxwell?
			Accessing...
			Chief O'Brien served under his
			command aboard the Rutledge.
			Very well. Mister Riker...
			Counselor... you will greet our
			guests in Transporter Room Three.
			And advise Chief O'Brien that I
			will be calling on him.
			Yes, sir.
			The delegation is ready to come
			aboard, sir.
			I believe you served under
			Benjamin Maxwell?
			Captain Maxwell? I'm proud to
			say I did.
			It seems Maxwell has taken it
			upon himself to destroy a
			Cardassian space station.
			If that's true, sir, there was
			a reason for it. I'd bank my life
			on that.
			The Captain may want to talk to
			you about him.
			Bring them aboard.
			Welcome to the Enterprise. I am
			First Officer William Riker...
			this is Counselor Deanna Troi.
			I am Gul Macet... my aides, Glinn
			Daro and Glinn Telle.
			Our Transporter Chief, Mister
			O'Brien.
			Captain's Log, supplemental: We
			have entered Cardassian territory,
			and are proceeding in our quest
			to locate the Phoenix.
			... and with long-range sensors,
			we've been scanning a radius of
			ten light years. We can
			effectively scan one sector in
			a day.
			We are scanning Sector
			twenty-one-five-oh-five now. So
			far... no sign of the Phoenix.
			In fact, you have no assurance
			that the ship is still in Sector
			twenty-one-five-oh-five.
			In fact, we don't have any idea
			where it is. But the last known
			co-ordinates seemed like a
			reasonably good place to start.
			We would welcome any additional
			intelligence your forces could
			provide.
			Captain Picard... you can
			understand that we are skeptical.
			Do you expect us to believe that
			you are using every means at your
			disposal -- to track down one of
			your own?
			Of course you would have concerns,
			Gul Macet. It is precisely
			because of that fact that I am
			including you in every aspect of
			our effort.
			You are here, with my staff,
			hearing reports as I hear them.
			Nothing is edited... nothing
			withheld.
			Please. Let us continue.
			Very well.
			Our Transporter Chief, Mister
			O'Brien, has served with Benjamin
			Maxwell. I thought he might
			provide some insights.
			Mister O'Brien... I believe
			Captain Maxwell lost his family...
			during a raid on an outpost.
			More like sabotage, sir. It was
			on Setlik Three. A squad of
			Cardassian militia made a sneak
			attack on an outpost... wiped out
			close to a hundred civilians.
			Then it's vengeance he's after.
			That's not what I meant --
			Maxwell's taking retribution for
			his own loss.
			Captain Maxwell would never --
			Gentlemen, please. Let us avoid
			speculation, and confine this
			discussion to facts. Now, Mister
			O'Brien --
			Worf to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			Captain -- long range sensors have
			located the Phoenix.
			Will you join me on the Bridge?
			Deck six.
			Deck ten.
			Your Captain is most impressive.
			Yes. He is.
			Chief O'Brien... our Transporting
			system is still operating with
			active feed pattern buffers. I
			would like to talk with you about
			your technology.
			I'll have to get Commander
			La Forge's approval on that.
			I understand. In the meantime...
			we're going to your Ten-Forward.
			Will you join us?
			If my commander tells me to
			discuss the Transporter with you,
			I will. If Captain Picard orders
			me to tell you everything I know
			about Ben Maxwell, I will.
			But who I choose to spend my free
			time with... that's my business.
			We have located the Phoenix in
			Sector twenty-one-five-oh-five.
			Ensign, set a course -- warp six.
			Mister Worf, send a message by
			sub-space. Tell them to prepare
			to rendezvous with us.
			Yes, Captain.
			Captain... a suggestion.
			Yes?
			We have a number of ships in
			sector twenty-one-five-oh-five.
			If you give us more precise
			coordinates... and the ship's
			coded transponder frequency...
			we could intercept Maxwell much
			more quickly than you.
			I'm sure that's true. However,
			given the circumstances, I'd
			prefer to make the initial contact
			myself. As I'm sure you would
			if the situation were reversed.
			Time is crucial. You have a
			dangerous man out there, with a
			huge arsenal at his command. If
			he's bent on revenge against my
			people... he must be stopped
			before he can do more damage.
			At the moment, we have an isolated
			incident. If I reach him first,
			diplomatic efforts can still
			prevail.
			But if one of your ships decides
			to retaliate against the
			Phoenix... we risk losing control
			of the situation.
			Then you won't give us the means
			of finding his exact location?
			No. I will not.
			There you are... potato casserole
			-- a dish fit for kings.
			... minstrel boy to the war is gone...
			What's that you're singing?
			What? Oh... just an old song...
			A bunch of us used to sing it
			together... on the Rutledge.
			I haven't thought about it for
			years...
			What's it about?
			Oh... about war, and glory...
			"The minstrel boy to the war is gone;
			In the ranks of death you'll find him;
			His father's sword he hath girded on;
			And his wild harp slung behind him."
			... Captain Maxwell always liked
			that song...
			I guess all this business with
			him and the Cardassians... brought
			it back.
			You know... sitting with the
			staff this morning, I could
			tell there were people in that
			room who still don't like the
			Cardassians.
			I imagine that's to be expected...
			You do?
			The war lasted a long time. That
			takes its toll on people. What
			are these little black things?
			Capers. But the fighting is over
			now. Why would anyone still
			feel... however they feel?
			Maybe it's not that easy for some
			people to forget.
			I'm... trying to understand. The
			people who hang onto -- grudges.
			Seems to me they ought to be able
			to put those feelings aside...
			once the fighting's done with.
			That may be harder to do than to
			say.
			You fought the Cardassians, didn't
			you?
			There were some skirmishes... when
			I was with Captain Maxwell.
			Well... how do you feel about
			them?
			Me? I feel... fine. I mean...
			the war's over now.
			Tomorrow night... kidney pie.
			And then maybe pot roast... beef
			tongue...
			The pursuing ship is the Phoenix.
			And the other?
			We believe it to be a Cardassian
			supply ship.
			How would you know that?
			We... are able to make that
			determination.
			You can read our transponder
			codes!
			What is important at the moment
			is that your ship may be in
			jeopardy. Mister Worf -- any
			answer to our communications?
			No, Captain.
			Put a repeating message on all
			sub-space channels. Make it a
			Priority One communique -- break
			off pursuit immediately.
			Gul Macet... as you can see, we
			are doing everything in our power
			to reach the Phoenix.
			And accomplishing nothing.
			Can you show me the location of
			our other ships?
			Mister Data.
			You see... we have a warship which
			could intercept the Phoenix before
			it's too late. If you will give
			us the transponder frequency.
			Or are you going to stand and
			watch while our ship is destroyed?
			Mister Worf -- has there been any
			response to our hails?
			No, sir.
			Very well... prepare to relay the
			transponder code of the Phoenix
			to the Cardassian warship.
			Sir -- ?
			And then send a message to Captain
			Maxwell... advise him that we
			have relayed his location to the
			Cardassians.
			Begging your pardon, Captain...
			the transponder code will allow
			them to track all our ships.
			I'm aware of that. Mister Worf
			-- any response from the Phoenix?
			No, Captain.
			Mister Data, any change in their
			their course?
			Nossir. The Phoenix is
			continuing on its bearing
			toward the supply ship.
			Mister Worf... relay the prefix
			codes of the Phoenix to the
			Cardassian warship.
			Sir, they'll be able to dismantle
			its shields! The Phoenix won't
			have a chance.
			I cannot allow Maxwell to
			ambush that supply ship. Mister
			Worf -- now.
			Yes, Captain.
			Sir, the Cardassian warship is
			moving on the Phoenix.
			Mister Data, overlay weapon
			ranges of the two ships...
			The warship is three hundred
			thousand kilometers from the
			Phoenix. It is opening fire.
			The Phoenix has taken a direct
			hit.
			The Phoenix is beginning evasive
			maneuvers.
			It has positioned itself outside
			the weapons range of the opposing
			ship.
			The Phoenix has powered up with
			both phasers and photon
			torpedoes.
			The Phoenix is firing photon
			torpedoes.
			He has destroyed our warship...
			Does the supply ship carry any
			weapons?
			Limited. Not enough to defeat
			a Nebula Class Starship.
			Sir...
			The warship carried a crew of six
			hundred... the supply ship...
			fifty...
			Mister Data... estimated time
			until we intercept the Phoenix.
			At our present speed of warp four,
			sixteen hours, forty-four minutes.
			Ensign, increase to warp nine.
			Captain... ?
			I wanted to... chat with you.
			Anything I can do, sir, you know
			that.
			Ben Maxwell must be quite a man.
			He's a rare one, all right.
			I count myself lucky, sir -- I've
			served with the two finest
			Captains in Starfleet.
			Then... from your knowledge of
			the man... what has gone wrong?
			There's a reason for what he's
			doing. Those Cardassians were
			up to something, I'm sure of it.
			How did he take it... when his
			family was killed?
			I'd say he took it well. Oh, I
			know he was broken up inside...
			who wouldn't be? But you'd never
			know it to see him. He never
			missed a minute's duty, always
			had a smile and a joke...
			I see...
			And Captain Maxwell, he'd never
			retaliate out of vengeance, no
			matter what that Cardassian says.
			They're up to something...
			they're the ones you should be
			investigating, sir, not Captain
			Maxwell.
			You don't care for the
			Cardassians...
			I like them fine. It's just...
			well, I know them. You learn to
			watch your back around those
			people.
			Within the last hour... Benjamin
			Maxwell has sent over six hundred
			of them to their deaths.
			I don't know what to say, sir...
			he must've had his reasons...
			I think... when one has been angry
			for a very long time... one gets
			used to it. Then it becomes
			comfortable... like old leather.
			And finally, it is so familiar
			that one can hardly remember
			feeling any other way.
			But in the long run, we are the
			ones who are damaged by that kind
			of anger. We are. Not them.
			Kanar?
			Mind if I join you?
			You want another?
			And an ale.
			Kanar... never could develop a
			taste for it.
			It takes some getting used to.
			I wanted to say... I... I owe you
			an apology.
			Shouldn't have... popped off like
			that. In the Turbolift.
			I think... this is hard on all
			of us. I know I'll be happy when
			I'm back on my own ship.
			I guess that's true.
			I hadn't thought of it like that.
			I was on Setlik Three.
			With Captain Maxwell, the morning
			after the massacre. We got there
			too late, of course... almost
			everyone was dead...
			It was a terrible mistake... we
			were told the outpost was to be
			the launching place for a massive
			attack against us...
			The only people left alive were
			in an outlying district of the
			settlement... I was sent there,
			with a squad, to reinforce them.
			Cardassians were advancing on us,
			moving through the streets,
			destroying, killing... I was
			with a group of women and children
			when two Cardassian soldiers burst
			in... I stunned the one, but the
			other jumped me... we struggled...
			one of the women threw me a phaser
			and I fired...
			The phaser was set at maximum.
			The man just... incinerated...
			there, before my eyes.
			I'd never killed anything before.
			When I was a kid I would worry
			about having to swat a mosquito.
			It's not you I hate, Cardassian.
			I hate what I became... because
			of you.
			I will protest this, Klingon!
			Captain Picard.
			Mister Worf, you may release the
			man.
			He was found at a computer station
			on Deck thirty-five, attempting
			to access information on our
			weapon systems.
			A lie, Gul Macet. I was studying
			the terminal interface systems...
			they are more efficient than
			ours. I have no idea what was in
			the files.
			What business did you have going
			near one of their computers?
			But... Gul Macet... I meant
			nothing... there has been no harm
			done.
			Go to your quarters. You are
			confined there for the duration
			of this expedition.
			As you wish, sir.
			Mister Worf, please accompany him.
			Gladly.
			Captain... may we speak in
			private?
			You have the Bridge, Number One.
			Captain, I deeply regret what
			my aide has done. You have my
			word that he will be
			disciplined upon my return.
			You may take whatever action
			against him you feel is
			appropriate. I consider the
			matter closed.
			I'm not sure I would be so
			generous in your place, Captain.
			Thank you.
			If there is to be a lasting peace,
			Gul Macet, neither you nor I must
			allow any one man to undermine
			our efforts...
			There have always been those who
			crave war. Who need it.
			I am not one of them, Captain.
			I am beginning to see neither are
			you. We have had our full measure.
			The lasting peace begins here...
			with the two of us.
			Bridge to Captain.
			Picard here.
			We have located the Phoenix,
			Sir. We will intercept in
			twenty-two minutes.
			Captain's log, Stardate 44431.7.
			We have established communication
			with Captain Maxwell, and he has
			agreed to come on board.
			Welcome aboard, sir. I'm
			Commander Riker, First Officer.
			I know all about you, Commander.
			Fine work you did with the Borg.
			We all owe you on that one.
			Thank you, sir.
			O'Brien? Miles O'Brien?
			Hello, Captain. Good to see you
			again.
			How are you? I had no idea you
			were on the Enterprise.
			This was my Tactical Officer on
			the Rutledge. Best I ever had.
			Thank you, sir.
			O'Brien has the ability to size
			up a situation instantly, then
			come up with options to fit all
			contingencies. Remarkable.
			If that's true, I learned it from
			you, sir.
			But you got that silver tongue
			by kissing the stone, right?
			Well, Commander. Best I see your
			Captain straight away. We have
			a lot to talk about.
			Yes, sir.
			What a sweet ship this is... I'll
			admit, I've always wanted a Galaxy
			class vessel...
			Captain... Gul Macet. He and his
			aides are guests on the ship.
			I see.
			Captain Picard is waiting in his
			Ready Room. This way.
			Captain Picard... Captain Benjamin
			Maxwell.
			Captain...
			A pleasure. I've heard about
			you.
			Sit down, please.
			That will be all, Commander.
			You must think I've gone mad.
			The thought has occurred.
			Picard, I have to tell you... I
			was grateful when I realized it
			was you Starfleet sent after me.
			Somebody who knows what it's
			really like out here.
			I know of nothing out here that
			could justify what you've done.
			Then listen to this -- the
			Cardassians are arming again.
			That so-called science station?
			A military supply port.
			How do you know this?
			Information comes my way.
			From whom? Where is your
			documentation?
			You know how these things work...
			you see things, you hear things...
			you add them up and you know damn
			well what's going on.
			In other words, you have no
			documentation...
			I know what they're doing. I can
			smell it. There's no good reason
			for a science station in the
			Cuellar System... but it's a hell
			of a strategic site for a
			military transport station... a
			jumping off point into three
			Federation sectors. They're
			running supply ships back and
			forth... and nobody's gonna tell
			me it's for scientific research...
			Whatever circumstances you
			believed you encountered, why
			didn't you notify Starfleet?
			And wait six months while the
			bureaucrats sit around reading
			reports, trying to figure out what
			to do? They don't know what's
			going on out here... but you
			should, Picard, you know what it's
			like to be under fire...
			You weren't under fire.
			Lives were at stake...
			Whose lives?
			We had to act now...
			Why?
			It smells musty in here... like
			a bureaucrat's office.
			You have killed nearly seven
			hundred people... taken us to the
			brink of war...
			I have prevented war... or at the
			very least delayed it a good long
			time. The peace treaty was a
			ruse, to give them breathing room,
			time to regroup...
			And so you alone simply decided
			to dispose of the treaty...
			I took the initiative... I did
			what had to be done...
			'What had to be done'? For whom,
			Maxwell?
			Why does a man with your long,
			brilliant service suddenly abandon
			the fundamental principles that
			he has believed in, even fought
			for, all his life... ? I'll tell
			you what I believe... it was
			because of what they did to your
			wife... and your children...
			... Not true. Not true...
			... to avenge their deaths.
			You're a fool, Picard. History
			will look at you and say 'this
			man was a fool'.
			I'll accept the judgement of
			history.
			When it becomes clear what the
			Cardassians have done, I will be
			vindicated.
			What the Cardassians have or
			haven't done is irrelevant...
			Irrelevant... come with me and
			find one of their supply ships
			and we'll see how irrelevant it
			is...
			We are not going after any more
			Cardassian ships, Captain
			Maxwell... you are going to return
			to your bridge and set a course
			for Starbase Two-one-one... the
			Phoenix and the Enterprise will
			return to Federation space
			together. I will permit you
			the dignity of retaining your
			command during our voyage. My
			only alternative would be to put
			you in our brig, while we tow
			your ship back to starbase in
			disgrace.
			I will return to my ship.
			You understand your orders?
			Yes, Captain.
			Mister Worf, report to my Ready
			Room. Our guest is departing.
			Captain's log, supplemental: With
			the Phoenix in close formation,
			we are proceeding directly to
			Starbase Two-one-one.
			Mister Data, how long before we
			clear Cardassian space?
			At our present speed, three hours
			and twenty minutes.
			Mister Worf, send a message to
			Admiral Haden at Starfleet.
			Inform him of our projected time
			of arrival.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain... the Phoenix is changing
			course.
			What is he doing?!
			Ensign, change course to pursue.
			Mister Worf, hail Captain Maxwell.
			No response, sir.
			Data, project his new course.
			Sir, the Phoenix is heading
			directly for a Cardassian
			vessel... point-one-two light
			years from our location.
			He'll attack that ship -- just
			as he did the others.
			Continue your hail, Lieutenant,
			Priority One message.
			Do you know what that vessel might
			be?
			I imagine it's a supply ship,
			headed for the research station
			in the Kelrabi system. The
			destruction of our primary science
			outpost has put an added burden
			on the others.
			The Phoenix still does not
			respond.
			Ensign, warp eight. Overtake
			him.
			Sir, the Phoenix has accelerated
			to warp nine. We will not be able
			to reach him before he
			intercepts the Cardassian ship.
			Warp nine, Ensign. Mister Worf,
			arm phasers... continue hails...
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, Chief O'Brien was
			Maxwell's Tactical officer...
			Get him up here.
			Sir, the Phoenix has dropped out
			of warp. They have reached the
			Cardassian vessel.
			Slow to impulse.
			Vessels are in visual range.
			On screen.
			Has the Phoenix activated its
			weapon systems?
			Negative, sir. Phaser banks are
			not armed...
			What about the Cardassians?
			Our sensors are unable to
			determine status of the Cardassian
			defensive systems... Their ship
			is running with a high-powered
			subspace field.
			Mister O'Brien... your former
			Commander is about to place me
			in the unenviable position of
			having to fire upon another
			Federation ship. I will need
			to draw upon your knowledge of
			the man... how he thinks... what
			he is capable of doing...
			Aye, sir.
			Sir, Captain Maxwell is hailing
			us.
			On screen.
			All right, Picard, you need
			proof... you've got it now...
			Captain Maxwell, you have
			disobeyed a direct order...
			Board the ship, you'll see that
			everything I've been saying is
			true --
			The Cardassian ship will not be
			boarded. You will transport
			yourself aboard the Enterprise...
			Picard, if you don't board that
			ship, I'll destroy it.
			And I will use whatever force
			is necessary to prevent you from
			taking that action, Captain.
			Sir, Captain Maxwell... if he
			feels his back is to the wall,
			he'll strike...
			Captain, the Phoenix is
			transferring power to its
			shields...
			They're arming phasers... loading
			forward torpedo bays...
			Red alert. It appears you are
			correct, Mister O'Brien.
			Ready phasers... load torpedoes...
			Phasers ready... loading forward
			and aft torpedo bays...
			Sir? Let me beam over... try to
			talk to him.
			We served together a long time...
			after you've been through what
			we have... you kind of get inside
			a person. He might listen.
			He'll never drop his shields to
			let you transport on board.
			The Phoenix is using a high-energy
			sensor sweep. It cycles every
			five-point-five minutes. Between
			those cycles there's a window of
			a fiftieth of a second.
			Trust me. I can get through.
			Make it so.
			It's good we're trying this with
			another Federation ship. It would
			never work with an alien vessel.
			I'm not so sure it's going to work
			this time. Can you get an
			accurate enough fix on his shield
			modulation to get through?
			I think so. The Phoenix should
			be following standard Starfleet
			protocols. They have to align
			their shields at the start of
			every sweep.
			So you'll sync up the beam...
			And slip right through...
			But if there's any phase error...
			you could materialize outside the
			ship... we'd never have a chance
			to correct.
			I've been monitoring his sweep
			patterns... I'm telling you, I
			can compensate...
			And I guess we could increase the
			pattern buffer cycle to give us
			a little more margin for error...
			The current cycle is almost
			finished, sir... they'll be phase
			aligning in twenty seconds...
			Okay, Chief -- let's do it.
			Stand by... five seconds... here
			we go... two... one...
			Good luck, Chief.
			Not now!
			I'm not armed.
			How the devil did you get over
			here?
			I had the thought that if I talked
			to you... we could figure a way
			out of this mess.
			The way out of this is clear,
			O'Brien. Talk to Picard... get
			him to board that damned ship...
			He won't do that, sir...
			But he'd turn his weapons on a
			Federation Starship to protect
			the enemy? I don't believe it...
			He will, you can count on it.
			What the hell has happened to
			this war...
			Sir, there is no war... the war
			is over.
			You're wrong. The Cardassians
			live to make war.
			That's what everybody thinks about
			the enemy. That's probably what
			they think about us.
			We're not the same at all. We
			do not start wars. We do not make
			surprise attacks on manned
			outposts. We do not butcher women
			and children in their homes...
			children who never got the chance
			to grow up...
			You were on Setlick with me...
			you saw what they did...
			Yes, sir.
			What was the name of the fellow
			who hung on to you like a puppy?
			Will Kayden...
			Stompie.
			Stompie. As cool under fire as
			a mountain lake...
			Yessir.
			He died at Setlick, didn't he...
			Yessir.
			What was that song of his... the
			one he always sang... the one I
			liked...
			"The minstrel boy to the war is gone...
			In the ranks of death you'll find him... "
			"His father's sword he hath girded on,
			And his wild harp slung behind him...
			Land of song, said the warrior bard,
			Tho all the world betrays thee,
			One sword at least thy rights shall guard,
			One faithful harp shall praise thee."
			I'm not gonna win this one, am
			I Chief?
			Nossir.
			Maxwell to Bridge. Stand down
			all weapons.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain's log, supplemental:
			Captain Maxwell has turned his
			ship over to his First Officer and
			transported aboard the Enterprise.
			I have confined him to quarters
			for the return voyage.
			I'd just like to say... he's a
			good man, sir... What he did was
			terribly wrong, I know that now...
			but I'm still proud to have served
			with him.
			Thank you, Mister O'Brien. Well
			done. That'll be all.
			His loyalty is admirable... even
			if it is misplaced.
			The loyalty you would so quickly
			dismiss does not come easily to
			my people, Gul Macet. You have
			much to learn about us. Benjamin
			Maxwell earned the loyalty of
			those who served with him. In
			war, he was twice honored with
			the Federation's highest citation
			for his courage and valor. And
			if he could not find a role for
			himself in peace, we can pity him,
			but we shall not dismiss him.
			You are welcome to your opinion,
			Captain. I for one am grateful
			he is under lock and key.
			Oh, one more thing, Macet.
			Maxwell was right. Those ships
			weren't carrying scientific
			equipment, were they?
			A 'research' station within arm's
			reach of three Federation
			sectors... ? Cargo ships running
			with high energy subspace fields
			that jam sensors?
			If you believed the transport ship
			carried weapons, why didn't you
			board it as Maxwell requested?
			I was here to protect the peace,
			a peace I firmly believe is in
			the interests of both our peoples.
			But if I had attempted to board
			that ship... I am quite certain
			that you and I would not be
			sitting here now. And that ships
			on both sides would be arming for
			war.
			Captain, I assure you...
			Take a message to your leaders,
			Gul Macet. We know. We'll be
			watching. We'll be ready.
