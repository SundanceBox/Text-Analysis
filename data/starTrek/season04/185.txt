			Second Officer's Personal Log:
			Stardate 44390.1 Record entry
			for transmission to Commander
			Bruce Maddox, Cybernetics
			Division, Daystrom Institute.
			Dear Commander Maddox,...
			In reference to your most recent
			letter, I agree that your study
			lacks sufficient primary source
			information on my programming.
			Therefore in response to your
			request, this correspondence will
			include a complete record of my
			activities during a normal day,
			focusing on my perceptions of
			friendship.
			Good morning, Commander. You are
			fifteen minutes early.
			Well, it's a special day. I
			thought the... father of the bride
			would enjoy being relieved a
			little early on the wedding day.
			Thank you, sir.
			Nervous?
			I cannot become nervous. However,
			I do sense a certain...
			anticipation regarding my role
			in the wedding.
			All systems normal, sir. Sickbay
			reported that Lieutenant Juarez
			went into labor at zero four
			hundred hours. We remain on
			station awaiting the arrival of
			the starship Zhukov and guest
			quarters have been prepared for
			Ambassador T'Pel.
			Very well. I have the Bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			Begin day watch.
			Initially Commander Maddox, I
			found it difficult to maintain
			friendships since human emotions
			are often puzzling to me.
			Eventually, I developed a program
			enabling me to predict human
			emotional responses to specific
			actions.
			Come in.
			It is time for the wedding
			rehearsal.
			I know...
			I've decided not to go through
			with it, Data.
			You do not wish to rehearse?
			No, I'm... calling off the
			wedding.
			May I ask why?
			It's just the right thing to do.
			Have your feelings for Chief
			O'Brien changed?
			I'm supposed to be getting
			married, Data. I should be
			happy... but I'm not. I just feel
			this weight pressing down on me.
			Will cancelling the wedding make
			you happy?
			Yes.
			He'll probably be just as relieved
			as I am.
			Data, you introduced us, you mean
			a lot to both of us... I'd really
			appreciate it if... you would tell
			Miles for me.
			If you wish.
			I have often heard my friend Chief
			O'Brien say that above all else,
			he wants to make Keiko happy.
			Since cancelling the wedding will
			make her happy, I must conclude
			the Chief will be pleased at her
			decision.
			I have good news.
			Oh?
			Yes. Keiko has made a decision
			designed to increase her
			happiness.
			She has cancelled the wedding.
			She what?
			Cancelled the wedding? Today?
			Without even a word... of all the
			childish, selfish... !
			Next time, maybe I should break
			the... good news.
			Commander Maddox, it would appear
			that my program designed to
			predict emotional responses
			needs... adjustment.
			Personal Log: Supplemental. This
			is the one thousand five hundred
			fiftieth day since the Enterprise
			was commissioned.
			Besides the arrival of Ambassador
			T'Pel, other events occurring
			today include four birthdays,
			two personnel transfers, a
			celebration of the Hindu Festival
			of Lights, two chess tournaments,
			one secondary school play, and
			four promotions.
			Overall... an ordinary day.
			The Zhukov is ready for transport,
			sir.
			Energize.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
			Ambassador.
			I would meet with your Captain.
			Unlike my human friends, I am not
			affected by feelings or emotional
			considerations. In that sense,
			I am closer to being Vulcan than
			human, but I am not attracted to
			Vulcan philosophy. Their devotion
			to logic does have a certain
			appeal in its simple purity...
			... but I find theirs to be a
			somewhat... stark philosophy,
			lacking beauty... and joy.
			Ambassador T'Pel...
			I come to serve.
			Your service honors us.
			My first officer, Commander
			William Riker.
			Leave us, please.
			Charming woman.
			The tone of Commander Riker's
			voice makes me suspect that he
			is not serious about finding
			Ambassador T'Pel charming. My
			experience suggests that in fact
			he may mean the exact opposite
			of what he says. This is a form
			of expression I have not yet been
			able to master.
			You don't need a haircut. You
			were just in here last week.
			Hey, I wouldn't be back here so
			soon if you'd done it right the
			first time...
			When I have difficulty
			understanding human behavior I
			often turn to Commander Geordi
			La Forge. I consider him to be...
			my best friend.
			I know you want to be beautiful...
			I'm just a barber, not a miracle
			worker.
			Just try to keep my ears on
			straight today, all right?
			Friendly insults and jibes...
			another form of human speech
			that I am attempting to master.
			Hi... here for a trim?
			My hair does not require
			trimming... you peabrain.
			What?
			My hair...
			'Peabrain'?
			I am experimenting with friendly
			insults and jibes. It was not
			meant as a serious disparagement.
			Well... I wouldn't try it out on
			the Captain.
			Geordi, I am still confused about
			Chief O'Brien's reaction this
			morning.
			He was just surprised, Data. He
			didn't mean to blow up like that.
			He knows Keiko probably doesn't
			want to call off the marriage.
			She's just getting cold feet.
			Cold feet... jitters... a nervous
			reaction to an impending event
			of great importance.
			Right. Don't worry,
			everything'll be fine. She'll
			change her mind again.
			She will?
			Absolutely.
			Then you believe the wedding will
			still proceed?
			Trust me, they'll get married...
			so you better find a gift.
			I find Lieutenant Worf to be what
			is called a kindred spirit. We
			were both orphans and were both
			rescued by Starfleet officers.
			In many ways, we are both still
			outsiders in Human society. I
			do not fully understand why, but
			I find it... comforting to think
			that I am not alone in that
			regard.
			Are you here to find a wedding
			gift?
			Yes.
			I would appreciate your help in
			selecting an appropriate item.
			Of course. I have attended human
			weddings before.
			This is a traditional gift?
			My adoptive parents often give
			these... things at family
			weddings. A human custom.
			It was my understanding that the
			item selected should reflect the
			personality of whoever is giving
			the gift.
			This does not remind me of you.
			Have you ever been an actual
			participant in a human wedding?
			No.
			You would not consider it to be
			an honor?
			An honor, perhaps. But human
			bonding rituals involve a great
			deal of talking, dancing, and
			crying.
			Dancing...
			Continue to monitor the
			contractions. I'd say she still
			has a couple hours to go.
			You're going to be just fine.
			I am rarely in need of Doctor
			Beverly Crusher's professional
			services as my biomechanical
			maintenance program (tech) is
			self-sufficient. But I often
			observe as she practices medicine
			on others and have learned a
			great deal about the human
			condition from her.
			Doctor, may I ask a favor of you?
			Of course.
			Will you teach me how to dance?
			What?
			I would like to learn how to
			dance.
			Why me?
			It is in your service record.
			'Awarded first prize in tap and
			jazz competition, Saint Louis
			Academy---
			Okay, okay.
			Have I said something to upset
			you?
			It's just... that was a long time
			ago.
			I'd rather not be known as... as
			the dancing doctor. Again.
			Then your answer is no?
			All right. But let's keep this
			between us.
			Of course, Doctor.
			Commander Data, please report to
			the Bridge.
			Acknowledged.
			Mister Data... I need a tactical
			projection of possible future
			Romulan deployments along the
			Neutral Zone. Access all
			Federation records on the subject
			and then report to my Ready Room.
			That is a very general request,
			Captain. Is there a more specific
			area you wish me to study?
			No.
			Set course one-three-zero mark
			two-four-six. Warp seven.
			That course will take us very
			close to the Neutral Zone,
			Captain.
			I'm aware of that. Proceed.
			Lay in the course.
			It is fortunate that I am able
			to perform my duties without
			emotional distractions. If that
			were not the case, a sudden course
			correction toward the Neutral Zone
			would make me very... nervous.
			Personal Log: Supplemental.
			Commander Maddox, there are still
			many dynamics of social
			interaction which I do not
			understand.
			The belief among humans that a
			captain must remain distant from
			his crew is puzzling. Captain
			Picard and I have worked together
			closely for over three years...
			Come.
			... and yet I cannot truthfully
			refer to him as my friend. I find
			that thought to be...
			disappointing.
			Based on your analysis, what is
			the current Romulan strategy
			behind the deployment of their
			ships in this sector?
			Their ships are deployed to
			support a policy of confrontation
			designed to test Federation
			defenses along the Neutral Zone.
			Do you predict any change in the
			near future?
			I project a ninety percent
			probability that they will
			continue to pursue this policy.
			Are there any indications of a
			more conciliatory attitude on
			their part?
			No, sir.
			Caution is clearly called for,
			Captain. However, the mission
			must proceed as planned.
			Starfleet Command agrees with you,
			Ambassador. But I would feel
			better if you would consent to
			an escort or...
			Thank you, Mister Data.
			Feline supplement seventy-four.
			Computer, run fluidic sensor
			diagnostic.
			Diagnostic complete. All systems
			functioning within normal
			parameters.
			Come in.
			Am I intruding, Commander?
			No.
			Would you care to sit down?
			When one of my friends is
			distraught, I know that I should
			attempt to make him more
			comfortable.
			May I offer you some refreshment,
			chief?
			No, thank you, sir. First of
			all... I'd like to apologize for
			this morning in Ten Forward...
			There is no need to apologize.
			I was not offended.
			Perhaps you would like a pillow
			or a more comfortable chair to
			sit upon.
			Uh... no sir. Thank you, sir.
			Would you care to listen to music?
			Brahms? Aurelia? Mexler?
			No, sir... really... I'm fine.
			I came here to... to ask for your
			help.
			It's about Keiko... I'd like you
			to talk to her... convince her
			to go through with the wedding.
			Would Counselor Troi not be a more
			appropriate choice to speak with
			Keiko?
			She already has... it didn't
			help.
			You've known her longer than I
			have... I just thought she might
			listen to you.
			She won't even talk to me...
			I do not know what to say to her.
			Just talk with her... try to make
			her see reason. She's going off
			half-cocked and not thinking this
			through. You've worked with her
			for a long time... she respects
			your opinion.
			Perhaps she has not fully analyzed
			her decision.
			Thank you, sir. I won't forget
			this.
			Commander Maddox, I noted that
			Keiko was quite calm and rational
			when she informed me of her
			decision this morning.
			Therefore, I can predict that
			she will respond to an objective
			analysis of the situation based
			on the available facts.
			It is fortunate that she has not
			let emotional considerations cloud
			her judgement. It should make
			my task much simpler.
			Hi.
			Am I disturbing you?
			No...
			There is a high likelihood that
			your decision to cancel the
			wedding was an error.
			What?
			I believe you made an incorrect
			analysis of the facts at hand.
			What do you mean?
			You do not seem happy.
			Well, no...
			Your decision was based on the
			assumption that cancelling the
			wedding would bring you happiness.
			That has proved to be incorrect.
			Data... it's not that simple.
			Since your action did not produce
			the desired results, the most
			advisable solution is to
			re-examine the decision-making
			process and look for errors.
			I knew what I was doing. It's
			my decision.
			That fact is not in dispute.
			However, you may have acted with
			undue haste... and in doing so,
			you have unintentionally hurt
			Chief O'Brien's feelings.
			I did what I had to! Why are you
			doing this? I thought you were
			my friend.
			I am your friend.
			Then leave me alone.
			If I have offended---
			Just... leave me alone.
			It is clear that I need guidance
			to resolve this situation.
			Counselor Troi's advice should
			be useful.
			In many ways, she is the friend
			that I understand the least. Her
			life and her duties are predicated
			on her understanding and
			perception of emotions. Since
			I have none, no doubt she finds
			me as much of a mystery as I find
			her.
			Chief O'Brien talks to me... Keiko
			talks to you... why do they not
			talk to each other?
			That's a good question, Data.
			I wish I had a good answer for
			you. Perhaps when they're ready,
			they will.
			Many aspects of this situation
			are puzzling. I have been
			studying relevant texts on the
			subject of marriage, but I have
			not found a suitable guide.
			A suitable guide for what?
			In an effort to be helpful, I
			am trying to calculate the
			variables involved in a successful
			marriage.
			Good luck.
			There are many different
			opinions. On Galvin Five, a
			marriage is considered successful
			only if children are produced
			within a year of the wedding.
			Andorian marriages require groups
			of four people unless two---
			Data... would you like my advice
			on how to help them?
			Don't. This is something they
			need to work out for themselves
			now.
			But I am their friend. Should
			I not stand with them in a time
			of difficulty?
			There are many ways of helping
			a friend... sometimes the best
			way is to leave them alone.
			Do you believe marriage to be the
			right decision for them?
			I don't know. They are very much
			in love, but sometimes that isn't
			enough. Marriage is an agreement
			to share who you are with someone
			else... to spend your lives
			together... to grow old together.
			'To grow old together?' Is that
			an integral component of
			marriage?
			Why do you ask?
			Although I am an android, I have
			not excluded the possibility that
			I too may someday marry.
			There's nothing wrong with that.
			I believe I have much to offer
			a potential mate, however we
			cannot grow old together,
			Counselor, because I will not grow
			old.
			You do have a lot to offer,
			Data...
			Commander Data, this is Ambassador
			T'Pel. Please report to my
			quarters.
			Acknowledged.
			Enter.
			You have a priority three
			clearance aboard the Enterprise?
			That is correct, Ambassador.
			I require information on this
			ship's defense and navigational
			systems. Access code kappa alpha
			four-six-zero-one-seven-zero-four.
			That code is valid.
			What is the field strength of the
			ship's deflector shields at
			maximum output?
			May I ask what is the purpose for
			this request?
			I require the information.
			I have the same safeguards as the
			ship's computer. Therefore, I
			must report any inquiry regarding
			restricted information to the
			Captain along with a report
			stating the nature and purpose
			of the inquiry.
			Your reaction suggests that you
			do not wish the Captain to be
			informed of your inquiry.
			No. I was not interested in the
			information. I was curious as
			to your security safeguards.
			They appear to be adequate.
			Cancel request. You may leave.
			Commander Maddox, I have often
			wished for the sense that humans
			call intuition or instinct.
			Since Vulcans do not lie, I must
			accept the Ambassador's
			explanation... but I still wish
			I could have a... gut feeling
			to back up this conclusion.
			Program Crusher Four in progress.
			Hi.
			Whatta ya think? It's a recreation
			of the studio where I took my
			first dance lesson.
			It appears to be quite suitable,
			Doctor.
			All right, then. Let's start with
			something real simple.
			Go ahead, try it.
			Good! Now try this...
			Wait a minute...
			Try it again, but watch my
			arms...
			And... you say you're never done
			this... ?!
			That is correct. Perhaps it would
			be beneficial to show me the final
			lesson.
			Okay...
			That was the easiest lesson I've
			ever given.
			Then I have succeeded in learning
			how to dance?
			You seem to have... picked up the
			basics.
			Thank you, Doctor. I am now ready
			to dance at the wedding.
			Wedding?
			Keiko's wedding.
			But you never... you didn't say
			it was for the wedding.
			Is that important?
			Well... yes. They don't do a
			lot of tap dancing at weddings...
			Why not?
			Because... well... actually I'm
			not exactly sure, Data. But we'd
			better try a style of dancing
			they will do at the wedding...
			Computer, run "Blue Moon".
			Compared to what we were just
			doing, it's very simple. Just
			follow me. One, two, three,
			four---
			No, no... you're trying to---Ow!
			Move more slowly... that's it...
			no, now you're--Ow! Stop music.
			I am sorry.
			I don't get it... you picked up
			tap dancing so quickly...
			I cannot reproduce your
			performance if I cannot see your
			feet.
			You need something to copy. You
			can't just... dance?
			No, Doctor.
			All right... this time, watch my
			feet. Computer, start music.
			Don't try to imitate me. You
			have to lead.
			Lead where?
			Indicate to your partner where
			you're going to step.
			How is this accomplished... ?
			Watch me, I'll lead...
			Notice I don't repeat the same
			pattern over and over... I
			improvise... Good... Now you
			lead...
			Look up... into my eyes...
			Good... You're holding me too
			tight, Data...
			This is a very complex set of
			variables to coordinate.
			You're doing fine... now smile,
			like you're enjoying yourself...
			Doctor Crusher please report to
			Sickbay.
			Is it Lieutenant Juarez?
			Yes, Doctor. Her contractions
			are now one minute apart.
			I'm on my way.
			Why don't you try it with an...
			artificial partner for a little
			while? Don't be afraid to
			experiment.
			I will. Thank you, Doctor.
			Computer, create dance partner,
			female.
			Begin music.
			... he still won't talk... so they
			put the Count's head on the
			chopping block... 'one more
			chance' says the Queen. 'No' says
			the Count. The headsman swings
			his axe and just as the blade
			falls, the Count says 'Wait, wait,
			I'll talk!' but it was too late.
			And the moral to the story is
			don't hatchet your counts before
			they chicken.
			Commander Riker's easy-going
			manner and sense of humor is
			fascinating. It is one reason
			why he is so popular among the
			crew. I believe it may also be
			partly responsible for his success
			in matters of love. There may
			be a possible correlation between
			humor and sex... the need for more
			research is indicated.
			Commander, we have reached the
			designated coordinates.
			All stop.
			Captain Picard to the Bridge.
			Hold position. Long range scan.
			I have detected a ship in the
			Neutral Zone, Captain.
			Configuration... Romulan Warbird.
			Yellow Alert.
			Mister Worf, hail the Warbird.
			Aye, sir.
			They are responding... text only
			Captain.
			We are to proceed to the agreed
			coordinates.
			Set course zero three seven mark
			zero zero five, warp four. Take
			us into the Neutral Zone, Ensign.
			Captain, the Warbird is holding
			position. In three minutes we
			will be within phaser range.
			Red Alert.
			My crew knows their duty,
			Ambassador. They will take no
			provocative action... without my
			order.
			Hold position at these
			coordinates.
			Slow to half impulse.
			Open a channel.
			Open.
			This is Ambassador T'Pel. I have
			arrived.
			I am Admiral Mendak.
			There is no established protocol
			for a meeting of this nature.
			The logical course is for me to
			transport aboard your ship and
			begin the negotiations.
			Yes...
			Captain, I note your defensive
			systems have been activated.
			As are yours, Admiral.
			It was not meant as an
			accusation...
			Indeed, I salute your show of
			strength. Ambassador, we are
			honored by your presence. You
			may transport aboard at your
			convenience.
			The honor is mine.
			Instruct your Transporter Room
			to stand-by. I will beam to their
			ship without further delay.
			Ambassador, I must once again urge
			you to reconsider. The Enterprise
			can accommodate a Romulan
			delegation without sacrificing
			security or---
			Captain Picard, I find your
			arguments illogical. Please carry
			out my instructions.
			Bridge to Transporter Room Three.
			O'Brien here.
			Prepare to beam Ambassador T'Pel
			to the Romulan ship.
			Aye, sir.
			Maintain a lock on her signal
			once she's aboard their vessel.
			At the first sign of trouble I
			want to be able to bring her
			back.
			Understood.
			Transporter activated...
			Captain---!
			Transporter emergency! I'm
			losing her signal!
			Boosting power to autosequencers.
			Engaging computer override.
			O'Brien what's happening down
			there?
			I'm losing the pattern... trying
			to re-establish...
			I'm sorry, sir... I wasn't able
			to retrieve the signal... the
			Ambassador's dead.
			The signal lock wasn't broken,
			sir. I had just entered the
			transfer sequence when the
			Ambassador's pattern began to
			break up. I tried to go to
			emergency manual control, but the
			pattern deteriorated too rapidly
			and...
			Personal Log: Supplemental. The
			risks aboard a starship are
			accepted by all who serve, but
			I have never failed to observe
			a deep emotional response to the
			loss of a comrade. It is at times
			like this that I greatly miss the
			ability to share human feelings.
			Captain, there is no prior record
			of this type of accident occurring
			on a starship. Back-up systems
			and safeguards are designed to
			prevent just such an occurrence.
			I can't find any system flaws in
			the unit, sir. All the
			Engineering status reports were
			normal. None of the backups were
			activated and the autosequencers
			all functioned normally.
			Any prior malfunctions with this
			Transporter unit?
			No, sir. In fact, we replaced
			the transition coils only a week
			ago.
			Could there have been some kind
			of interference from the Romulans?
			Nothing that I could see... their
			shields were down... there was
			no power interruption... no
			subspace bias.
			I want that unit pulled and its
			systems checked again. I also
			want a level one diagnostic
			performed on all Transporters.
			Aye, Captain.
			Her molecular structure
			dissipated instantly once the
			pattern was lost. There were a
			few organic compounds left on the
			pad, but there's not enough
			material for an autopsy.
			To die in a Transporter
			accident... Hardly a fitting end
			for one of the Federation's most
			honored diplomats.
			Bridge to Captain. Admiral Mendak
			wishes to speak with you.
			We're still waiting, Captain.
			Is there a problem?
			There's been... an accident.
			Ambassador T'Pel... was killed
			in a Transporter malfunction.
			What kind of malfunction?
			We're investigating that right
			now. I'm sure that---
			I should have known the Federation
			wasn't serious about this
			conference.
			Admiral, I can assure you that
			the Federation places the highest
			priority on this mission and its
			goal.
			Well played, Captain... well
			played. Starfleet opposes
			normalization of relations with
			the Romulan Empire and so you are
			ordered to create... an accident.
			You're mistaken. I am ready and
			willing to discuss the
			establishment of full diplomatic
			relations under the same terms
			as Ambassador T'Pel.
			A generous offer, since you know
			that we were only willing to
			negotiate with T'Pel.
			I salute you again, Captain. It
			was a maneuver worthy of a
			Romulan. I suggest we both leave
			the Neutral Zone before there
			is... another accident.
			Set course for Federation
			territory, warp two.
			Engage.
			Mister Data, take charge of the
			investigation. Study computer
			logs, sensor information...
			everything. I refuse to believe
			this was a simple malfunction.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain Picard was the person who
			first interested me in the works
			of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle.
			I have subsequently become a great
			admirer of the fictional detective
			Sherlock Holmes and his ability
			to solve mysteries by careful
			examination of the available
			evidence.
			I have found Holmes' methodology
			of deductive reasoning to be quite
			useful in performing my duties.
			One of his adages is that once
			you have eliminated the
			impossible...
			... whatever remains, however
			improbable, must be the truth.
			I'm afraid I can't give you
			another lesson right now, Data.
			That is not my purpose. I wish
			to examine the remains of
			Ambassador T'Pel found on the
			Transporter pad.
			I'm working on my report right now.
			Have you compared the genetic
			code with the Ambassador's last
			recorded Transporter ID trace?
			No... that's not part of the
			standard procedure. Why?
			I could be pursuing an untamed
			ornithoid without cause.
			A wild goose chase?
			Okay... let's see what happens...
			Computer, access Transporter ID
			trace of Ambassador T'Pel.
			All right... there's the genetic
			record of the Ambassador when she
			beamed aboard the Enterprise.
			Now, the breakdown of the
			organic material found on the
			Transporter pad should be
			identical.
			Mitochondrial structure fits all
			general parameters... no change
			in the nucleotide bases...
			There's a slight discrepancy in
			the base pair sequence.
			Chemically, these are identical...
			however, the organic sample from
			the Transporter is showing
			numerous single-bit errors... like
			replicated material.
			Can you postulate an explanation
			for the discrepancy?
			I'd say the DNA was either mutated
			by the Transporter during the
			rematerialization process...
			A supposition not supported by
			the Transporter records.
			Or these aren't the remains of
			the Ambassador.
			The only abnormality found during
			my investigation was a temporary
			increase in the matter to energy
			signal ratio. This fluctuation
			was well within operating
			parameters and would normally not
			invite further consideration.
			However, due to the circumstances,
			I decided to investigate the
			possibility that a second
			Transporter signal had caused the
			fluctuation. Although this was
			highly improbable, it was the only
			remaining theory.
			A second transporter signal?
			From where?
			From the Devoras.
			Romulan transporters operate on
			similar subspace frequencies to
			our own. With minor adjustments
			they could be made to simulate
			our own transporter carrier wave.
			So they beamed the Ambassador off
			our own pad.
			While simultaneously a small
			amount of genetically similar
			material was left in the
			Ambassador's place.
			To make us believe she died as
			a result of the 'malfunction.'
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Worf, where is the Devoras?
			The ship is still in the Neutral
			Zone...
			... on course zero seven nine mark
			one two five... speed warp two.
			Heading for home.
			The safest and most logical
			decision in this situation is to
			contact Starfleet and await
			further instructions. However,
			based on past experience, I
			project only a seventeen percent
			chance Captain Picard will choose
			that alternative.
			Red Alert. All hands stand to
			battlestations.
			Lay in an intercept course to the
			Romulan ship.
			Shields up, load all torpedo bays,
			stand-by phasers.
			Course laid in, Captain.
			Warp factor eight. Engage.
			Open a channel to the Devoras.
			Aye, sir.
			No response.
			The Devoras is dropping out of
			warp... their weapon systems are
			powering up.
			Go to impulse power.
			Aye, sir.
			Message coming in, sir.
			On screen.
			Captain Picard, you agreed to
			leave the Neutral Zone without---
			Admiral Mendak, you are holding
			our Ambassador captive.
			I can assure you... there is no
			one being held captive aboard this
			ship.
			We know about the Transporter
			'malfunction' and that you are
			holding Ambassador T'Pel.
			Captain, Romulan Warbird
			decloaking to starboard!
			I suggest you leave... now.
			It is my responsibility to protect
			the lives of Federation citizens.
			I will not permit this abduction
			to succeed..
			Captain, you're not going to start
			an incident which might---
			I am prepared to take whatever
			action is necessary to obtain the
			Ambassador's return.
			In poker, there is a moment when
			a player must decide if an
			opponent is being deceptive or
			actually holds a winning hand.
			This decision is based not only
			on the odds, but also on an
			appraisal of the man. Is he
			bluffing or does he have the
			cards?
			Fortunately... I'm not ready to
			start a war today...
			T'Pel?
			Sub-Commander Selok, actually.
			A spy.
			A patriot, Captain... she has
			performed her service to the
			Empire with distinction.
			Thank you for your... help,
			Captain.
			You can see now that we are not
			holding one of your citizens...
			and we thank you for returning
			our sister to us.
			But my patience has limits... the
			game is over. I expect you to
			leave peacefully. Now.
			Sir, long-range scanners show
			three more Romulan ships moving
			into this sector.
			Some days you get the bear, some
			days the bear gets you.
			Reverse course... take us back
			to Federation territory, warp six.
			Engage.
			Captain Picard once drew an
			analogy between life and a chess
			game... he said that the loss of
			a single piece does not concede
			the game itself.
			The Captain has also said that
			out of the ashes of defeat rise
			the victorious dreams of men.
			I find that to be a worthy
			philosophy and I have incorporated
			it into my programming.
			Keiko, I need your help.
			I have offended you and need to
			find a way to rectify my mistake.
			I am not sure what to do.
			You didn't offend me.
			I should not have interfered.
			It would be best if I apologized.
			It would be best if you got
			dressed.
			For the wedding?
			But...
			Oh, come here... I have a
			beautiful carnation for the
			father of the bride... don't be
			nervous now...
			I am not nervous.
			I am just... confused.
			Since the time of the first wooden
			sailing ships, all captains have
			enjoyed the happy privilege of
			joining two people in the bonds
			of matrimony. And so now it is
			my honor to unite you Keiko
			Ishikawa, and you Miles Edward
			O'Brien together in marriage here
			in the sight of your friends and
			family.
			There are still many human
			emotions I do not fully
			comprehend... anger, hatred,
			revenge...
			But I am not mystified by the
			desire to be loved...
			... the need for friendship...
			these are things I do understand.
			I was looking for Doctor Crusher.
			I wished to thank her for my...
			She just left.
			The Juarez child?
			A boy.
			At the same time we were facing
			destruction... this small miracle
			was taking place.
			Welcome aboard.
			All systems normal, sir. We are
			on course for Adelphous Four.
			Engineering is realigning the main
			deflector dish, Sickbay reports
			Lieutenant Umbato broke two ribs
			during a Holodeck exercise, and
			sensors continue to gather long
			range information on the Murasaki
			Quasar.
			Very well. I have the Bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			Begin night watch.
			If being human is not simply a
			matter of being born flesh and
			blood... if it is instead a way
			of thinking, acting... and
			feeling... then I am hopeful that
			one day I will discover my own
			humanity. Until then Commander
			Maddox, I will continue...
			learning, changing, growing...
			and trying to become more than
			what I am.
