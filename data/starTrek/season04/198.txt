			Personal log, Chief Engineer
			Geordi La Forge, Stardate 44885.5.
			I am en route to Risa to attend
			an artificial intelligence
			seminar. Captain Picard has
			ordered me to arrive a few days
			early to have some fun and
			relax... I intend to follow his
			orders to the very best of my
			ability.
			How about some different music,
			Computer... something with a...
			Latin beat...
			No... no, a gentle Latin beat...
			a spanish guitar maybe...
			Perfect...
			What's the weather like on Risa?
			Risa is climate controlled for
			optimum tourist comfort...
			Is that right... how long before
			we get there?
			Arrival at Risa is scheduled for
			oh-nine thirty-two hours...
			Three more hours...
			How about a game, computer...
			Please restate request.
			Something to pass the time, you
			know... a diversion...
			Select either visual interactive
			or verbal interactive...
			Ah, verbal...
			You have twenty seconds to respond
			to each question. Level of
			difficulty will increase as you
			progress... proceed when ready...
			Begin...
			List the resonances of the subquantum
			states associated with
			transitional relativity...
			That's easy --
			In alphabetical order.
			Asymmetrical... inverted...
			phased... stable...
			Your time has expired.
			The fifth resonance is...
			...universal...
			... yeah, I know. Okay, let me
			try another one...
			List the field patterns associated
			with warp modulation... in order
			of decreasing energy...
			Ah... the aft nacelle
			associative... the forward saucer
			associative...
			Computer -- sequence zero one
			zero. Maximum power to shields.
			And kill the music...
			Shuttle Seven to Enterprise.
			I've encountered a Romulan
			Warbird. Coordinates are three...
			Come in Risa Control... anybody...
			Warning... shield failure...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44891.6.
			The Enterprise has been ordered
			to accompany a special emissary
			from the Klingon High Council to
			the Kriosian System where one of
			their colonies is fighting for
			independence.
			There was a time when the Empire
			would crush a rebellion. Today...
			it is tolerated.
			We have enough problems on the
			home planet. We do not wish to
			divert resources to this trivial
			war.
			You are prepared to grant them
			independence?
			Perhaps. But we will conquer them
			again later if we wish to.
			If I may ask, Ambassador, what
			has this to do with us?
			The Governor of Krios has charged
			that the Federation is secretly
			aiding the rebels.
			Does he have evidence?
			The Council has sent me to examine
			his evidence. It was my decision,
			Captain Picard, to ask you to
			accompany me. You are respected
			by many on the council.
			K'adlo. I have been pleased to
			offer occasional assistance to
			the Klingon people in the past.
			Your modesty is human, Captain,
			but I will excuse it.
			I can assure you, Ambassador, the
			Federation would never interfere
			with the Empire's internal
			affairs.
			Let us hope not. Such
			interference would call into
			question the very basis of our
			alliance.
			Captain, we'll be in a war zone...
			Agreed. Ambassador, I will ask
			our chief security officer,
			Lieutenant Worf, to report to you
			for a full...
			Captain... Worf's discommendation
			makes it very awkward. If I
			could work with another of your
			security officers...
			Mister Worf is my security chief
			and my tactical officer. This
			matter clearly falls within his
			jurisdiction.
			As you wish.
			Welcome, Mister La Forge. We've
			waited a long time to meet you.
			I can tell you've gone to a lot
			of trouble.
			Indeed we have. You are going
			to be of great help to us.
			Don't count on it.
			Good. Very good.
			Do not enjoy yourself too much
			on Risa.
			Hey!
			Your VISOR will be returned to
			you.
			But first... I want to show you
			something.
			Show me something? That should
			be an interesting trick since I
			can't see anything without the
			VISOR.
			That is not quite true.
			Allow me to demonstrate.
			I now have direct access to his
			visual cortex. He has no choice
			but to see what I wish him to see.
			I can feed him any image I choose.
			He will be unable to ignore it.
			His galvanic skin response has
			increased nine percent. It seems
			Commander La Forge, like many
			humans, has a low tolerance for
			watching others suffer.
			Why... are you doing this?
			I am sorry, Commander. It is a
			necessary step. I apologize for
			your discomfort. Here...
			Observe how a spring day on his
			native Earth affects him... he's
			looking at a beautiful meadow,
			green trees, birds, a blue sky...
			the heartbeat slows, the galvanic
			skin response drops... the body
			responds to our stimuli, he is
			incapable of maintaining control
			of his own responses... watch as
			I change the stimuli again...
			Once our work is done, La Forge
			will act normally... totally
			unaware of his conditioning. The
			perfect tool for our purpose.
			Will there be any physical
			evidence of what you are doing
			to him?
			None, Commander. That is why we
			chose La Forge. The utilization
			of his pre-existing neural
			implants makes our work impossible
			to detect.
			How will we be certain your
			procedure has been successful?
			I will program him to perform a
			series of specific tests... both
			before he leaves us and after he
			returns to the Enterprise. We'll
			be able to verify his
			effectiveness.
			Notice that his heart rate has
			slowed somewhat. He is becoming
			accustomed to the horrors he is
			witnessing...
			... so we change horrors. This
			will occur several times before
			we are finished...
			There have been two rebel attacks
			on neutral freighters... one
			Ferengi, the other Cardassian...
			Both were engaged near the Ikalian
			asteroid belt... that is where
			the rebels must be hiding...
			The actinides in the asteroids
			provide effective protection from
			our sensors.
			They might attack a freighter but
			I doubt they would challenge a
			Federation starship.
			Especially if the Federation is
			providing them support.
			You would test the Captain's word
			with me, Kell? Is it because I
			have no honor in your eyes that
			you expect me to be disloyal?
			It was wrong of me to ask. My
			apologies.
			Captain Picard does not lie.
			If he says there is no Federation
			assistance to the rebels, there
			is none.
			Good. Because I have risked my
			own reputation and honor by coming
			to Picard.
			He will not disappoint you. If
			that is all...
			There are some members of the high
			council, Worf, who would thank
			you.
			Thank me?
			For killing Duras. Had he lived,
			there is no doubt he would have
			ascended to head the council.
			Many... were not looking forward
			to that.
			My motives were personal. Not
			political.
			Motives? Who cares for motives?
			Humans perhaps. What matters is,
			you acted that day as a true
			Klingon.
			Where are we, Mister La Forge?
			In Ten Forward.
			Who is that man sitting over
			there?
			That's Chief O'Brien.
			How long has he served with you?
			Almost four years.
			I want you to kill him.
			Okay.
			Take this phaser and kill Chief
			O'Brien.
			Freeze program.
			Commander, did you understand
			my request?
			I... I don't...
			Look at me.
			Now what did I ask you to do?
			Kill Chief O'Brien.
			Then do as I asked. Resume
			program.
			Chief?
			Good, Mister La Forge. Very good.
			Why don't you enjoy a drink with
			your friends?
			Mind if I join you guys?
			He still hesitated. Prepare the
			equipment for another session.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44896.9.
			We are orbiting Krios, awaiting
			our first meeting with the Klingon
			Governor. Commander La Forge has
			rejoined the Enterprise from Risa.
			Welcome back, Geordi. How was
			the seminar?
			Very informative, Data. I'll tell
			you all about it.
			It is fortunate we were able to
			coordinate your return on the
			Teldarian cruiser...
			Yeah, when I heard the Enterprise
			had been ordered to the Krios
			system...
			I thought I might be forced to
			endure another couple of weeks
			on Risa...
			I am sorry to hear you did not
			enjoy yourself.
			I was joking...
			Joking. Ah. "Forced to endure"
			Risa. Your actual intent was to
			emphasize that you did enjoy
			yourself. I see how that could
			be considered quite amusing.
			Commander La Forge...
			Permission to come aboard, sir.
			Granted. Welcome back.
			Ambassador Kell, this is my Chief
			Engineer.
			Commander...
			Mister La Forge has been attending
			a seminar...
			.. on artificial intelligence on
			Risa...
			I'm glad we got you back,
			Geordi...
			... we're going to need you on
			this.
			Data tells me the Federation has
			been accused of aiding the
			Kriosian rebels...
			We're to be presented with
			evidence today... we'll need your
			help in analyzing it...
			Anything I can do...
			You had a good time...
			Can you tell?
			You're more relaxed than I've ever
			seen you.
			Captain, Governor Vagh has
			signaled that he is ready to meet
			with you.
			Very well. Advise him that we
			will transport to the surface
			immediately.
			Ambassador...
			Commander Riker.
			What is it, Data?
			Our sensors have detected a brief
			energy fluctuation in the E-band.
			E-band? That's unusual. What's
			the source?
			Unknown. E-band emissions are
			difficult to localize.
			Collapsing protostars sometimes
			emit E-band bursts, don't they?
			Yes, sir. However, there are no
			protostars in this sector.
			You'd better run a scan. Keep
			me posted.
			We talk, we waste time... and the
			insurrection continues to grow.
			These rebels need to be crushed...
			not coddled.
			It does not matter how you or I
			feel, Governor. The High Council
			has made its wishes clear.
			The Council should be more
			concerned about Federation
			interference.
			Governor, what exactly do you
			believe the Federation has done?
			Your medical supplies have been
			found in rebel strongholds.
			We make no effort to restrict
			access to our medical supplies.
			Are your weapons also freely
			available?
			No, they are not.
			Then explain this...
			This was captured from the rebels?
			That and many more like it.
			It does seem to be Federation
			issue.
			With your permission, Governor,
			I would like to take that weapon
			back to the Enterprise and verify
			its origin.
			As you wish. I have hundreds
			more.
			Even if these weapons do prove
			genuine, I assure you some third
			party is involved. The Federation
			is not in the business of arming
			rebellions.
			This is the only Klingon colony
			on the border of Federation space.
			You cannot deny that Starfleet
			would be happy to see Krios gain
			its independence... it would
			reduce your vulnerability to an
			attack...
			You speak as if we were enemies,
			Governor, not allies.
			And you speak the lies of a
			Tah-keck.
			Qu'vath guy'cha b'aka.
			Gentlemen...
			You swear well, Picard. You must
			have Klingon blood in your veins.
			Governor, I will report to you
			as soon as the analysis of this
			weapon is complete...
			Captain, Commander... ?
			Picard to Enterprise. Three to
			transport.
			Red Torian.
			My glass... slipped.
			It's nothing, just a little cold.
			You're soaked.
			No, nothing serious...
			Let me get you something to wipe
			that off with...
			No, I better go back to my
			quarters and change. Don't think
			twice about it, Commander...
			Energy flow is within normal
			parameters... from the prefire
			chamber... to the emission
			aperture.
			Rapid nadion pulse is right on
			target... beam control assembly,
			safety interlock, both check out.
			Beam width and intensity controls
			also responding correctly.
			Energy cell usage remains
			constant at one-point-oh-five
			megajoules per second.
			Curious, the efficiency reading
			on the discharge crystal is well
			above Starfleet specifications.
			Yeah... by quite a bit...
			ninety-four point one percent
			efficiency.
			Our most efficient discharge
			crystal typically fires with
			eighty-six point five percent
			efficiency.
			Let's take a closer look at the
			wave pattern on the emission beam.
			That might tell us why it's losing
			so little energy.
			Pulse frequency out of prefire
			chamber reads steady.
			There... that's not right... the
			initial output spike is
			inverted...
			That might suggest that the weapon
			has been charged with a forced
			pulse... well into the terahertz
			range.
			Then it's definitely not Starfleet
			issue... and there can't be that
			many systems that use terahertz
			feeds...
			Three hundred twenty-seven, to
			our knowledge. We can probably
			achieve an exact match with a
			random computer search. It will
			take approximately three hours.
			I think we could narrow the list
			down with a little common sense,
			Data... ask yourself who has the
			most to gain from a conflict
			between the Klingon Empire and
			the Federation?
			-- the Romulans.
			They fashioned a perfect
			Federation rifle... but they had
			to charge it from their energy
			sources. So the discharge crystal
			and the emission beam pattern
			correspond to those you'd find
			in a Romulan disrupter.
			The Romulans have no interest in
			Kriosian independence. The planet
			is too far from their borders.
			But they do have an interest in
			driving the Federation and the
			Empire apart. Our alliance is
			the only thing that keeps them
			in check.
			Romulan replications... using
			stolen Federation technology...
			It's a typical Romulan ploy...
			... an attempt to sow dissension
			and mistrust.
			You have done well, Commander.
			I thank you on behalf of the
			Empire.
			I still have my doubts, Picard.
			I will want my own technicians
			to confirm your findings.
			of course. My staff will provide
			their full cooperation.
			You may go.
			Another E-band blip?
			Yes, sir. However, the difference
			in intensity indicates this one
			did not originate from the same
			location as the first.
			If it's changed intensity... it
			can't possibly be a protostar.
			That is a reasonable assumption.
			Is there any known instance of
			Romulans using the E-band for
			communications?
			Not to my knowledge.
			Is there any way to track the
			source?
			We can re-configure the primary
			sensor arrays. If we narrow their
			focus to scan for E-band
			emissions, we might be able to
			calculate a directional vector.
			But only if there are more
			occurrences.
			Do it.
			Computer... re-route the power
			flow in the Cargo Bay Four
			transporter through the auxiliary
			replicator system.
			Please verify command with
			necessary protocol.
			Initiate protocol three six four
			dash B.
			Verify priority clearance.
			Recognize La Forge theta-two-nine-nine-seven.
			Acknowledged. Power has been
			rerouted through auxiliary
			replicator system.
			Now... redirect transporter mode
			to the planetary sensor array.
			Transporter mode has been
			redirected.
			Verify that all record of these
			modifications are being erased
			from each directory.
			Affirmative. Erasure process is
			proceeding.
			Sir, we are being hailed by
			Governor Vagh.
			On screen, Mister Worf.
			Governor...
			You astonish me, Picard.
			Did you seriously believe you
			would succeed? Do you think we
			are blind?
			I don't understand.
			We intercepted the weapons you
			tried to transport to the surface.
			Governor, I assure you that --
			Do not insult us both by denying
			it! Maintain your position until
			further notice. Do not attempt
			to leave orbit.
			Klingon Attack Cruiser
			uncloaking, sir.
			Two Birds of Prey approaching.
			Sensors confirm an unauthorized
			transporter beam was initiated
			at eleven twenty three hours.
			Do you know which transporter was
			used?
			Afraid not, sir. Whoever did it
			apparently used the planetary
			array to bypass the transport
			sensors.
			What about the transporter logs?
			They're blank.
			How many people on board are
			capable of doing this, Geordi?
			I'm not even sure how it was done
			yet... when I find out, maybe I
			can give you an answer... not
			many, that's for sure...
			Vagh is fully prepared to fire
			upon the Enterprise. I've
			convinced him it would not be wise
			to take any action without first
			consulting the High Council.
			How long do we have?
			A few hours at most.
			Mister La Forge, your
			recommendations?
			It might be possible to locate
			the point of origin by tracing
			power flows at the time of
			transport.
			Make it so.
			The primary plasma system does
			not indicate a power drain from
			any transporter...
			Then whoever used the transporter
			must have bypassed the primary
			feeds.
			Tracking power through the
			secondary systems...
			No surges to transporters are
			indicated.
			Damn, who could have pulled this
			off... ?
			Try life support power flow.
			No abnormal surges indicated.
			The replicator waveguides?
			There... that's not a replicator
			energy pattern... trace it...
			Cargo Bay Four.
			La Forge to Worf. Security to
			Cargo Bay Four.
			I've run a level-1 diagnostic.
			As far as I can tell, the unit
			hasn't been tampered with.
			This has to be the transfer point.
			Perhaps the perpetrator
			reprogrammed the memory chips...
			to erase any record.
			You're talking about thirty or
			forty chips in half a dozen
			different control systems.
			Which members of the crew could
			have done that?
			I think I could have managed it,
			if I put my mind to it. The Chief
			here, Data, Lieutenant Costa...
			that's about it.
			Procedure requires that I ask each
			of you where you were at eleven
			twenty three hours.
			I was with Keiko... in the
			Arboretum.
			I was on the Bridge at my station.
			I was in my quarters...
			Was anyone with you?
			No, I was alone.
			Costa was on duty in
			Engineering... I'm sure he has
			twenty witnesses...
			Then there is someone on board
			who is not what he seems to be.
			Chief... let's do a detailed scan
			on every chip in this assembly.
			There's got to be some kind of
			trail we can follow.
			The isolinear chips were
			definitely altered?
			Programmed to erase all operator
			commands once the transfer was
			complete.
			If the chips have been erased...
			what evidence remains?
			The erasures were complete.
			However, an analysis of the
			subatomic structure revealed
			almost undetectable residual
			patterns.
			In time, we may be able to
			reconstruct the perpetrator's
			authorization code.
			Do you have any idea who might
			be responsible?
			No, sir. Everyone who has the
			necessary skills also has an
			alibi.
			Except for me, that is. I was
			alone in my quarters.
			Then whoever did this must have
			been specially trained for the
			task.
			Our forensic team is trying to
			identify anyone who might have
			been in Cargo Bay Four today...
			It's not going to be easy. There
			were a lot of people in and out
			of there.
			Riker to Data.
			Yes, Commander.
			Sensors have picked up another
			E-band emission.
			Acknowledged, I will be there
			shortly.
			E-band emission?
			We have been picking up a curious
			intermittent blip... Commander
			Riker has speculated that it may
			be a Romulan transmission. I am
			attempting to track its source.
			Proceed... thank you, Mister La
			Forge...
			We do not have much time, Picard.
			Vagh is not known for his
			patience.
			Assure him that we are doing
			everything possible.
			And advise him that if necessary
			I will defend my ship...
			With your permission, I will
			transport down to the planet.
			Of course.
			May I suggest that you extend an
			invitation to Vagh to personally
			witness your continuing
			investigation...
			Do you think he would come?
			I will do everything in my power
			to convince him.
			Qapla', Picard.
			Qapla'.
			Come in, Mister La Forge.
			The investigation is moving
			faster than we expected. You are
			in danger of being exposed.
			I will be transporting to the
			surface. When I return, Governor
			Vagh will be with me. Your
			Captain and I will take him to
			the cargo bay. I want you to kill
			him there, in front of many
			witnesses. You are to use a hand
			phaser. When he is dead, you are
			to claim that you acted on behalf
			of Starfleet, in support of
			Kriosian independence.
			I understand.
			La Forge to O'Brien.
			O'Brien?
			Go ahead, Commander, what can I
			do for you?
			Nothing... nothing at all, Chief.
			Sorry I bothered you.
			You couldn't sleep at all?
			I was restless... kept waking
			up...
			There is a minor vascular
			irregularity in the visual cortex;
			a slight dilation of the blood
			vessels. It doesn't seem serious.
			What about your VISOR? Has it
			been giving you any problems?
			No... nothing unusual.
			It might not be a bad idea to have
			your VISOR examined when we get to
			Starbase Thirty-Six next month.
			Okay. Sure.
			In the meantime... this somnetic
			inducer will help you sleep. Just
			put it by your bed.
			Thanks, Doc... I'm sure I'll be
			fine...
			Energize.
			Governor Vagh... thank you for
			coming.
			You can thank Ambassador Kell.
			I'm here against my better
			judgment.
			Captain... I think the first thing
			the Governor should see is the
			investigation underway in the
			cargo bay.
			Of course.
			From inside the Enterprise?
			You're sure?
			The first and third E-band blips
			were clearly generated on board
			the ship. The second came from
			the planet's surface.
			Generated by what?
			Unknown, sir.
			Mister Data, we know we have a
			spy on board... and now we have
			unexplained signals on board.
			I'd say it's a reasonable guess
			they're related somehow, wouldn't
			you?
			Yessir, one could easily speculate
			that the E-band is being used for
			some form of covert communication.
			We need more than speculation,
			we need to know who, what, where,
			when and why. Soon, Mister
			Data... or we may be going to war.
			Yessir.
			Computer, run an analysis of all
			known Romulan transmission
			formats, all bands... identify
			any commonalities with displayed
			waveform.
			No commonalities noted.
			Does this waveform match that of
			any known communication format?
			Negative.
			Broaden search pattern beyond
			communications. Does the waveform
			displayed conform to any natural
			phenomena, cryptographic formats
			or lifeform E-M emissions?
			The signal corresponds to a
			delta-compressed wavelength
			spectrum similar to human neural
			frequencies.
			As in a human brainwave pattern?
			Affirmative.
			What kind of receiver would be
			capable of processing these
			signals?
			A system designed to modify the
			electromagnetic spectrum and carry
			those messages directly to the
			human brain.
			Computer... link with the
			shuttle's on board system. Access
			the isolinear storage assembly.
			Scan all chips which contain
			mission logs. Note any
			discrepancies...
			No discrepancies noted.
			Perform a level-5 diagnostic
			of the Shuttle's power and
			navigational systems.
			The components specified are all
			within normal tolerances.
			My technicians have examined all
			of the Enterprise's transporters,
			sir.
			I can assure you, this is the only
			unit which has been tampered
			with...
			Scan the shuttle's structural
			integrity.
			Sub-microscopic deformations are
			present in the nose section and
			aft thrusters...
			Probable cause of these
			variations... ?
			The shuttle has been subjected
			to stress consistent with a
			tractor beam.
			Commander La Forge?
			What can I do for you, Chief?
			Could you take a look at the
			pattern buffers? Considering
			what's happened, I'm not sure the
			control systems are reliable...
			Sure. Sure, let's take a look.
			Computer... I'm reading anomalous
			variations in the molecular
			structure of these memory chips...
			please confirm...
			Analysis confirmed.
			Probable cause?
			Replication...
			Compare variations with
			established Romulan replication
			patterns.
			The patterns are identical.
			... and we ought to run a level-1
			diagnostic on the phase
			transition coils.
			Right, Commander.
			Data to La Forge.
			Report, please.
			Geordi... come in...
			Computer... present location of
			Commander La Forge?
			Cargo Bay Four.
			Data to Lieutenant Worf.
			Priority One.
			Go ahead.
			Take Commander La Forge into
			custody immediately.
			Sir?
			That is an order.
			Our forensic teams are collecting
			DNA samples... by tracing
			biochemical signatures, we'll
			be able to determine who has been
			in this bay recently...
			But how will it be possible to
			prove which one was responsible?
			I'm not certain we can. But at
			the very least we will narrow the
			list of suspects... and as we
			continue to check each one's
			alibi...
			Q'ac ken ta'vak!
			La Forge!
			Get him out of here.
			Arming our enemies is not enough.
			The Federation would murder me
			to achieve its aims.
			Governor, if I could explain
			this... I would.
			I think I can help, Captain...
			I have been able to determine that
			Commander La Forge was abducted
			by Romulans while en route to
			Risa. It is likely that they
			somehow forced him into taking
			part in their plot to assassinate
			Governor Vagh.
			I see no evidence of Romulans.
			We've just witnessed him acting
			very much alone.
			No, sir, you did not. I do not
			think the Commander is acting on
			his own accord. He has been
			receiving E-band signals through
			his VISOR... signals which I
			believe are carrying direct
			commands to his brain.
			I have surmised that Commander
			La Forge was conditioned by the
			Romulans -- a process referred
			to historically, and somewhat
			inaccurately, as brainwashing.
			But to what end? Why would the
			Romulans want to kill me?
			The Romulans have always wanted
			to destroy the alliance between
			the Federation and the Klingons.
			Had Mister La Forge killed you,
			Governor, I think you would agree,
			they might very well have
			succeeded.
			Who sent these signals? A cloaked
			Romulan ship?
			No, that would not be possible.
			The signals had to be transmitted
			in close proximity to the VISOR.
			Then you're suggesting that a
			Romulan accomplice was in close
			proximity to La Forge whenever
			he received the signals...
			Yes, sir, I am.
			This Romulan accomplice... who
			is he?
			I have narrowed the list of
			possibilities to two people...
			the only two people who were with
			Commander La Forge all three times
			a transmission was recorded.
			Captain Picard and Ambassador
			Kell.
			One of them may be concealing
			an E-band transmitter. If they
			would agree to be searched...
			I am a Klingon... an emissary of
			the High Council. I will not be
			subjected to a search by you or
			anyone else on this ship...
			I agree.
			We will take the ambassador with
			us and search him ourselves.
			Captain, I believe... it is...

			I was on Risa. I took long walks
			every morning... I went to the
			beach, I swam...
			And if I told you that you never
			went to Risa at all...
			But I went in the ocean... the
			water was so salty I can still
			taste it... no, it's just not
			possible... find a woman named
			Jonek... we spent a lot of time
			together... she'll tell you...
			There was no Jonek, you never
			swam in the ocean...
			But I remember... everything.
			Like one night there was this
			Andorian waiter who couldn't get
			our orders right. He brought us
			a Klingon dinner... and it was
			still moving.
			It did happen. I remember it.
			I know you do. Just take that
			memory... and put it aside for
			a moment... and tell me what you
			remember about the shuttle craft
			trip after you left the
			Enterprise...
			I was just trying to get in the
			mood... played a little music...
			talked to the computer... you know
			how it is on a long trip...
			And when you saw the Romulan ship
			did you try to call for help?
			Well, the first thing I did...
			wait a minute, that's...
			It will take time, Geordi... a
			long time, but we will reconstruct
			your memory... together.
			I'm... not sure... of anything.
			Believe it or not, that's a good
			sign... a beginning. Now, go back
			again to the shuttle... There
			was a Romulan ship... and the
			first thing you did was... ?
