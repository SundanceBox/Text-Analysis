			The knowledge and experience of

			hopeless...
			... Number One.
			First Officer's Log, Stardate
			43999.1. The Borg ship has
			resumed its course toward Earth.
			We are unable to pursue pending
			repairs to the Enterprise.
			... and as we anticipated, the
			blast burned out the main
			navigational deflector... we also
			have damage to shields and the
			reactor core.
			We should be back up in eight to
			twelve hours, Admiral.
			Well, we'll miss you at the party.
			The Enterprise will be there, sir.
			Maybe a little late. But we'll
			be there.
			Your engagements gave us valuable
			time. We've mobilized a fleet
			of forty starships at Wolf 359
			and that's just for starters...
			the Klingons are sending
			warships... Hell, we've even
			thought about opening
			communications with the
			Romulans...
			You realize, Admiral, that with
			the assistance of Picard, the Borg
			will be prepared for your
			defenses.
			Lieutenant... a few years ago,
			I watched a freshman cadet pass
			four upper classman on the last
			hill of the forty kilometer run
			on Danula Two... damndest thing
			I ever saw... only freshman to
			ever win the Academy marathon.
			I made it my business to get to
			know that young fellow... got to
			know him very very well... I'll
			tell ya, I've never known anyone
			with more drive, determination
			or more courage than Jean-Luc
			Picard. There's no way in hell
			he would assist the Borg. I
			want that clear.
			Of course, Admiral...
			He is a casualty of war.
			Then... we have abandoned all hope
			of recovering him.
			In less than twenty-four hours,
			this armada's going to hit that
			Borg vessel with everything we
			can muster. Either they survive
			or we do. As for Picard...
			A great man has been lost. Your
			Captain. My friend.
			Commander Riker... I hereby
			promote you to the field
			commission of Captain.
			The Enterprise is your ship now.
			Congratulations. I wish the
			circumstances were different.
			Good luck, Admiral.
			To us all.
			Come.
			Hi.
			You wanted to see me?
			How's the crew?
			Throwing themselves into the work
			to be done... the emotional impact
			hasn't been fully realized yet...
			I guess Starfleet training kicks
			in and takes over...
			We know the risks, tell ourselves
			we're prepared for the
			consequences... and yet, something
			like this cuts deeper than we can
			admit at first. He was our
			Captain. It's like losing the
			leader of a nation or the head
			of a family.
			He was more of a father to me than
			my own.
			When I saw him like that...
			mutilated...
			You did what you had to do...
			nobody doubts your love for him...
			Was there any part of him left,
			Deanna?
			Yes. I can still sense his
			humanity
			Then you must have sensed his
			pain...
			I don't envy your abilities.
			I'd better check on the progress
			of our repairs...
			There won't be any changes... as
			far as I'm concerned it's his
			ship, his crew... and everything
			we do, every battle we fight, it's
			for him.
			I'm glad you're here to help me
			with this.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Counselor...
			... and Mister Crusher has
			suggested a chip might be designed
			that will automatically retune
			phasers to a random setting after
			each discharge...
			That would be a great advantage.
			We should also see if we can find
			some way to neutralize their
			forcefields, Worf... we've got
			to show them we can adapt too.
			Engineering.
			We're not just fighting the Borg
			anymore... we're fighting the life
			experience they've stolen from
			Captain Picard... how the hell
			do we defeat an enemy that knows
			us better than we know
			ourselves... ?
			The Borg have neither honor nor
			courage... that is our greatest
			advantage.
			I hope it's enough.
			Engine control processors are back
			up...
			Accelerator coils are responding
			normally...
			Forward shields at fifty-eight
			percent... aft shields --
			Sensors must be down...
			Checking... sensors are fine...
			no, aft shields have completely
			failed... dammit... auxiliary
			generators are out again...
			Just the man I need.
			We're having problems with the
			aft shields... generators are
			going on and off line... I could
			use your help, Worf...
			How soon do we get underway,
			Geordi?
			Still a couple hours... Commander
			Shelby can fill you in...
			The main navigational deflector
			is functional again... Sherbourne
			and Barclay are running through
			the final testing sequence now...
			The warp reactor core?
			Reconstruction is proceeding
			normally... it's slow work. If
			we can nail down this shield
			generator problem, I agree with
			La Forge... we should be at
			operating capacity in two or three
			hours...
			Good.
			Anything else, sir?
			Yes. You did a good job on the
			Borg ship.
			I didn't get Picard.
			You stopped them. You gave us
			our shot.
			Sir...
			Commander, we don't have to like
			each other to work well together.
			In fact, I expect you to continue
			to keep me on my toes.
			Some might define that as the role
			of a first officer.
			Damn, you are ambitious, aren't
			you, Shelby...
			Yes.
			Captain Riker, based on our past
			relationship, there's no reason
			I should expect to become your
			first officer... except you need
			me. I know how to get things
			done. And I have the expertise
			in the Borg...
			You also have a lot to learn,
			Commander.
			Yessir.
			Almost as much as I had to learn
			when I came aboard as Captain
			Picard's first officer. He
			reminded me of that fact when I
			commented on what a pain in the
			neck you are.
			Yessir.
			Data to Riker. Message from
			Starfleet, Captain.
			Go ahead, Data.
			Starfleet reports it has engaged
			the Borg at Wolf 359.
			Admiral Hanson on subspace,
			Captain...
			On screen.
			Admiral...
			The fight does not go well,
			Enterprise... we're attempting
			to withdraw and regroup.
			Rendezvous with fleet...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44000.3.
			Repairs are complete. The
			Enterprise is warping to
			rendezvous with Starfleet at Wolf
			359. Subspace communications from
			the site of battle have been cut
			off possibly by Borg interference.
			Lieutenant Worf, everyone at this
			table shares my respect for your
			service to this ship. But right
			now, I need your experience at
			tactical... Mister Data, I
			realize that your very nature
			omits ambition. Nevertheless,
			I want you to know I thought
			seriously about you as first
			officer as well...
			Thank you, sir...
			But this is not a time for change.
			I need you all where you are,
			where Captain Picard always relied
			on you.
			I have been... reluctantly...
			forced to conclude that Commander
			Shelby, our expert on the Borg,
			is the ideal choice at this time
			for first officer.
			Based on our last communication,
			we have to assume the Borg have
			survived the fleet's attack...
			your thoughts on our next
			encounter...
			What about the heavy graviton beam
			we were talking about... ?
			I've gone over it four times...
			The local field distortion just
			wouldn't be strong enough to
			incapacitate them...
			Doctor Crusher and I have been
			working on an interesting
			premise...
			With our recent experience in
			nanotechnology, we might be able
			to introduce a destructive breed
			of nanite to the Borg...
			Nanites?
			Robots small enough to enter
			living cells.
			How much time would it take to
			execute this...
			That's the problem. Two, three
			weeks.
			In two or three weeks, nanites
			may be all that's left of the
			Federation.
			We have the new phaser adapters...
			Perhaps in concert with photon
			torpedoes... we can slow them
			down...
			I'm sure Captain Picard would have
			something meaningful and inspiring
			to say right now. And to tell
			you the truth, I wish he were here
			to say it, cause I'd like to hear
			it, too.
			I know how difficult this
			transition is for all of you.
			I can take over for him, but I
			can never replace Captain Picard
			and would never hope to...
			Whatever the outcome, I know our
			efforts in the coming battle will
			justify the faith he had in all
			of us.
			Dismissed.
			What would you do?
			Come in.
			May I speak to you, Captain?
			Well, actually Guinan... right
			now, I...
			Picard and I used to talk... now
			and again, when one of us needed
			to... I guess I'm just used to
			having the Captain's ear...
			I hope I'm not imposing.
			What's on your mind?
			I've heard a lot of people talking
			down in Ten Forward... They
			expect to be dead in the next day
			or two.
			They like you, Riker. They trust
			you. But they don't believe
			anyone can save them.
			I'm not sure anyone can.
			The way I see things, if a man
			is convinced he's gonna die
			tomorrow, he'll probably find some
			way to make it happen.
			The only one who can turn that
			around... is you.
			I'll do the best I can.
			You'll have to do something you
			don't want to do.
			Let go of Picard.
			Maybe you didn't hear --
			yesterday, I tried to kill him.
			You tried to kill whatever that
			is on the Borg ship. Not Picard.
			Picard is still here, still in
			the room with us.
			If he had just died, it would
			be easier. But he's been taken
			from us a piece at a time.
			Did he ever tell you why we were
			so close?
			No.
			Then I'm not going to tell you
			either. But it was beyond
			friendship, beyond family... and
			I will let him go. You must,
			too.
			There can only be one Captain.
			It's not that simple... This was
			his crew... he wrote the book on
			this ship...
			And the Borg know everything he
			knows...
			Yes...
			Then, it's time to throw the book
			away.
			You must let him go, Riker. It's
			the only way to beat him... the
			only way to save him.
			This chair is yours.
			Captain, we're approaching the
			Wolf system.
			On my way.
			Slow to impulse. Take us to the
			battle coordinates, Ensign...
			yellow alert...
			Sensors are picking up several
			vessels, Captain...
			The fleet?
			There are no active subspace
			fields... Negligible power
			readings...
			Lifesigns?
			Negative, sir.
			Visual contact.
			On screen.
			The Chekhov... The Kyushu...
			The Melbourne...
			Sir, sensors are picking up
			unusually strong magnetic eddy
			currents, bearing two-zero-zero,
			mark two-one-one.
			Data, your analysis...
			It could indicate the course of
			the Borg ship...
			Ensign Crusher, set a course that
			follows those currents...
			Aye, Captain.
			Commander Shelby, you will prepare
			to initiate your plan of
			separating the saucer section when
			we find the Borg.
			Sir. I must remind you that
			Captain Picard was briefed on that
			plan... the Borg will be prepared
			for it...
			I'm aware of that, Commander.
			In fact, I'm counting on it.
			Crusher, Cartaino, Gleason -- report
			to the Battle Bridge...
			Mister Data and Mister Worf, I
			have a special mission for you...
			Locutus of Borg, this is Captain
			William T. Riker of the U.S.S.
			Enterprise.
			You may speak.
			We wish to end the hostilities.
			Then you must unconditionally
			surrender.
			We are prepared to meet to discuss
			your terms.
			It is unlikely that you are
			prepared to discuss terms. It
			is more likely that this is an
			attempt at deception.
			Come now, Locutus, if Picard's
			knowledge and experience is part
			of you, then you know I have never
			lied to him... in fact, you should
			implicitly trust me, is that not
			so?
			Picard implicitly trusted you.
			Then trust me now. Meet with me
			to discuss terms.
			Discussion is irrelevant. There
			are no terms. You will disarm
			all weapons and escort us to
			sector zero-zero-one where we will
			begin the assimilation of your
			culture and technology.
			Mister Gleason, can you pinpoint
			the Borg's source of transmission?
			I can put you within thirty meters
			of it, sir...
			Mister O'Brien, report...
			The Borg have adapted their
			electromagnetic field to prevent
			main Transporter functions, sir...
			As expected. Mister Data and
			Mister Worf, you will proceed as
			we discussed...
			Aye, Captain...
			We would like time to prepare our
			people for assimilation.
			Preparation is irrelevant. Your
			people will be assimilated as
			easily as Picard has been.
			Does it involve a lot of
			needles... because I just hate
			needles...
			Your attempt at a delay will not
			be successful, Number One. We
			will proceed to Earth and if you
			attempt to intervene we will
			destroy you.
			Take your best shot, Locutus,
			cause we're about to intervene.
			Reset subspace communications
			to scrambler code Riker One...
			Scrambler code Riker One,
			acknowledged.
			Commander Shelby, report...
			Ready for separation.
			Make it so.

			The Borg tractor beam has moved

			They might be picking up engine
			ionization from the shuttle...
			Data, cut your engines... take
			her in unpowered...
			They're gonna make it...
			Shuttle has penetrated the Borg
			electromagnetic field...
			The shuttle escape transporter
			should provide adequate power
			to beam us onto the Borg ship from
			here, sir...
			And back, Mister Data?
			Yessir, there should be enough
			energy for two transports.
			Proceed.
			Mission accomplished... we have
			him...
			Firing shuttle thrusters...
			Beam them out of there, Mister
			O'Brien...
			Locked in...
			Transport successful, sir...
			Captain, we've sustained damage
			to the impulse drive... the saucer
			section is disabled...
			Reading subspace field
			fluctuations from the Borg ship...
			looks like they're getting ready
			to increase power...
			Stand-by, La Forge...
			The saucer section... it's a
			sitting duck...
			Prepare to draw their fire...
			Captain, the Borg ship... it's
			moving away...
			It's resuming its course to Earth,
			sir...
			Rendezvous with the saucer
			section... lay in a course of
			pursuit...
			There's extensive infiltration
			of microcircuit fibers into the
			surrounding tissues... his DNA
			is being rewritten...
			Can you revive him?
			I'd like more time to study the
			structural changes in the motor
			pathways...
			Doctor, we don't have more time.
			Once he was wired into the Borg,
			they knew everything he knew.
			I'm hoping it goes both ways.
			If we're lucky, he had access to
			everything we need to know about
			them... especially their
			vulnerabilities.
			Jean Luc... it's Beverly... can
			you hear me...
			Beverly... Crusher...
			Yes... don't try to move...
			I am... on board the Enterprise.
			That's right.
			A futile manuever.
			Locutus...
			Incorrect strategy, Number One...
			to risk your ship and crew... to
			retrieve only one man... Picard
			would never have approved...
			Security...
			You underestimate... us... to
			believe this... abduction would
			be of any concern...
			There is no need for
			apprehension... I intend no harm.
			No harm.
			I will continue... aboard your
			ship... to speak for the Borg ...
			as they continue... without
			further diversion... to sector
			zero zero one... where they will
			force your unconditional
			surrender.
			Using multimodal reflection
			sorting, I have been able to
			detect a complex series of
			subspace signals between Locutus
			and the Borg ship...
			That's how they're controlling
			him?
			It is not just a matter of
			control, Doctor. The signals are
			interactive across a subspace
			domain similar to that of a
			Transporter beam. I would
			hypothesize that these frequencies
			form the basis of the Borg's
			collective consciousness.
			Can't we block them?
			Possibly. But, as you will
			recall, on several occasions, we
			have witnessed the Borg removing
			key circuits from injured
			comrades... no doubt separating
			them from the group consciousness.
			The injured Borg immediately
			self-destructed.
			That is correct, sir.
			Cutting the link to Locutus might
			be fatal to Captain Picard.
			We have to find a way to reach
			him... we must know what he
			knows...
			Without these interactive signals,
			it would only be a matter of
			microsurgery... I could do it...
			but as long as those Borg implants
			are functioning, there's no way
			I can separate the man from the
			machine.
			Then perhaps... there is a way
			I can access the 'machine',
			Doctor.
			Worf.
			Klingon species. A warrior race.
			You too will be assimilated.
			The Klingon Empire will never
			yield.
			Why do you resist? We only wish
			to raise... quality of life...
			for all species...
			I like my species the way it is.
			A narrow vision. You will...
			become one with the Borg. You
			will... all... become one with
			the Borg.
			The Android... Data... primitive
			artificial organism... you will
			be obsolete in the new order...
			Take him to Data's lab...
			Shelby to Riker...
			Go ahead...
			Captain, the Borg have entered
			sector zero-zero-one...
			The Borg have dropped out of warp,
			sir... Jupiter Outpost Nine-Two
			reported visual contact at twelve
			hundred hours, thirteen minutes...
			Planetary defenses?
			Responding. No reports on
			effectiveness... but I can't
			believe that against the Borg...
			Mister Crusher, at their current
			speed, when will they reach Earth?
			Twenty-seven minutes...
			The soonest we can intercept?
			Forty-two minutes, sir.
			Riker to Data... your status?
			The initial cybernetic connection
			into Captain Picard's neural net
			pathways has been established...
			Mister O'Brien is ready to process
			the Borg signal through the
			transport pattern buffer.
			Make it so. And with dispatch,
			Mister Data...
			Proceeding immediately, sir. Data
			out.
			The neural link will be
			established in three stages...
			Doctor, I suggest you closely
			observe Captain Picard's lifesigns
			while Chief O'Brien monitors my
			positronic matrix activity at each
			stage... Counselor, hopefully
			you will be able to determine if
			I am reaching Captain Picard.
			At what point should I shut it
			down if there's a problem?
			I do not know. I have never done
			this before.
			Initating first neural link...
			The Captain's vital signs are
			stable...
			Positronic activity unchanged...
			First neural connection is
			confirmed... I cannot report any
			significant access to the Borg
			consciousness...
			It is confirmed... the Borg have
			broken through the Mars defense
			perimeter...
			Enterprise approaching the Terran
			system, sir...
			Slow to impulse... time to
			intercept...
			Twenty-three minutes, fourteen
			seconds, sir.
			Second neural connection is
			confirmed... I still cannot report
			any significant access...
			proceeding with the final link...
			Significant increase in premotor
			area and hypothalamus activity...
			his heartrate is accelerating
			rapidly...
			Sir, your submicron matrix
			activity is increasing
			exponentially.
			Neural connections are complete.
			I... have... access to the Borg
			subspace signals... Processing...
			processing...
			Data...
			Stand by... processing...
			Fascinating. The Borg group
			consciousness... is divided into
			subcommands... necessary to carry
			out all functions...
			communications, defense,
			navigation... they are all
			controlled... by a root command...
			implanted in each --
			Data, I'm picking up increased
			neural activity in Captain
			Picard... localized in the
			prefrontal and parietal lobes...
			The Borg might be trying to
			terminate their link with him...
			Negative... subspace signal
			configuration is unchanged. The
			cause of increased neural activity
			is unclear...
			No, it's not... it's him...
			Troi to Bridge. Data has made
			first contact with Captain
			Picard...
			Can you communicate with him,
			Data?
			I have been unable to create a
			neural path around the Borg
			implants, sir... it is Captain
			Picard himself who has somehow
			managed to initiate contact...
			Sir, the Borg have halted their
			approach to Earth...
			I think we got their attention...
			Time to intercept... ?
			Two minutes, four seconds...
			They're worried... they're worried
			that we've got access to Picard...
			we've got two minutes to figure
			out what we can do with it...
			Sir, it is clear the Borg are
			unable or unwilling to terminate
			their subspace links...
			That may be their achilles heel,
			Captain... their
			interdependency...
			What do you mean, Doctor?
			He's part of their collective
			consciousness... Cutting him off
			is like asking us to disconnect
			an arm or a foot... we can't do
			it.
			They operate as a single mind...
			If one jumps off the cliff... they
			all jump off the cliff...
			Data, is it possible to plant a
			command in the Borg collective
			consciousness...
			It is conceivable, sir... it would
			require altering the pathways from
			the root command, to affect all
			iterative branchpoints in...
			Make every effort, Mister Data...
			What command shall I try to plant,
			sir... ?
			Something straightforward... like
			'disarm your weapons systems'...
			Visual contact with the Borg...
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Sensors reading increased power
			generation from the Borg...
			Red alert. Load all torpedo
			bays... ready phasers...
			Aye, Captain...
			Status of the Borg weapons...
			Borg weapon systems are fully
			charged...
			Data... ?
			Attempting to reroute subcommand
			paths, Captain... defense systems
			are protected by access
			barriers...
			Borg attempting to lock on tractor
			beam...
			Rotate shield frequencies...
			Data, report...
			I am unable to penetrate defense
			systems command structure,
			Captain...
			Try the power systems, Data...
			see if you can get them to power
			down...
			Acknowledged... attempting new
			power subcommand path...
			Shields have failed...
			Fire all weapons.
			I cannot penetrate the Borg power
			subcommand structure... all
			critical subcommands are
			protected, Captain...
			Then it's over.
			Mister Crusher, ready a collision
			course with the Borg ship...
			You heard me. A collision
			course.
			Yessir.
			Mister La Forge, prepare to go
			to warp power...
			Sleep.
			Data, he's regaining
			consciousness...
			Sleep.
			It is Captain Picard speaking,
			not Locutus.
			Sleep. Data.
			He's exhausted.
			Yes, Doctor... but if I may make
			a supposition, I believe his
			message was not intended to
			express fatigue but to suggest
			a course of action.
			Borg cutting beam activated...
			Mister Crusher, en...
			Data to Bridge... stand by...
			Stand by all stations...
			I am attempting to penetrate the
			Borg regenerative subcommand
			path... it is a low priority
			system and may be accessible...
			Warning. Outer hull breach.
			Sir... shall I execute evacuation
			sequence...
			Negative, Mister Worf... Mister
			Data, your final report...
			Stand by...
			I can't, Mister Data...
			Warning. Inner hull failure
			imminent on decks twenty-three,
			twenty-four, and twenty-five...
			Decompression danger...
			Data? What the hell happened?
			I successfully planted a command
			in the Borg collective
			consciousness, sir. It
			misdirected them to believe it
			was time to regenerate. In
			effect, I put them all to sleep.
			To... sleep.
			Yessir.
			Status of Borg power drive... ?
			Minimal power...
			Electromagnetic field?
			Nonexistent.
			Commander Shelby, take an away
			team and confirm that the Borg...
			are... asleep.
			Delighted, sir.
			Shelby to Enterprise. It's true.
			They're all in their regeneration
			mode.
			Any indication to how long we can
			keep them like this...
			Checking...
			Commander, tricorder readings are
			fluctuating rapidly...
			Enterprise... there are
			indications here that their entire
			power net's about to feed back
			on itself. I'd say we're looking
			at a self-destruct sequence
			activated by the Borg's
			malfunction... do you want us to
			attempt to disarm it...
			There's no way to know what the
			destruction of the Borg ship will
			do to him...
			We should also consider the
			advantages of further examination
			of the Borg and their vessel, sir.
			I don't think so. Mister Data,
			separate yourself from Captain
			Picard.
			Away Team, get yourselves home.
			Mister Crusher, upon their return
			move us to a safe position.
			Life signs are stable... the DNA
			around the microcircuit fiber
			implants is returning to normal...
			How do you feel?
			Almost human.
			With a bit of a headache...
			We'll get you to Sickbay...
			We won't have any trouble getting
			these implants out now.
			How much do you remember?
			Everything.
			Including some brilliantly
			unorthodox strategy by a former
			first officer of mine.
			... and Earth Station McKinley has
			advised they're ready to begin
			refitting the Enterprise.
			Have they estimated the time for
			repairs... ?
			Five to six weeks...
			Come.
			Request permission to disembark,
			sir...
			Permission granted. They picked
			a fine officer for the task force,
			Commander.
			We'll have the fleet back up in
			less than a year...
			I... imagine you'll get your choice
			of any Starfleet command, sir...
			Everyone's so concerned about my
			next job. With all due respect,
			Commander... sir...
			... my career plans are my own
			business, no one else's.
			But it's nice to know I'll have
			a few options.
			I hope I'll have the fortune of
			serving with you again.
			Captain...
			Course to Station McKinley is laid
			in and ready, sir...
			Make it so, Number One.
