			Captain's Log, stardate 44741.9.
			We have arrived at Tagus Three
			where the Enterprise is to serve
			as host of the Federation
			Archeology Council's annual
			symposium.
			I look forward to giving
			tomorrow's keynote address with
			great anticipation.
			Come.
			I thought you'd want to know,
			Captain, the Council members have
			all been beamed aboard and
			assigned quarters.
			Excellent.
			It really is quite late, Captain.
			Tell me, Counselor, in regard
			to my lecture, which do you
			suppose would provide greater
			clarity? A chronological
			structure, or a division of each
			excavation's findings into various
			sociological, religious, and
			environmental sub-groupings?
			I thought you had already decided
			on a chronological structure.
			Still, there is something to be
			said for a more scientific
			approach.
			Captain, may I make a suggestion?
			By all means.
			Relax! You've written a brilliant
			speech.
			It needs to be. Tomorrow I'll
			be addressing some of the greatest
			scientific minds in the
			Federation. Switzer,
			Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland.
			Giants in the field of Archeology.
			Next to them I'm nothing but an
			enthusiastic amateur.
			I doubt they think of you as an
			amateur... not when it comes to
			the ruins of Tagus Three.
			Well, I have done my homework...
			I've examined the findings of
			every archaeological expedition
			conducted on the planet's
			surface...
			It's unfortunate the Taguans no
			longer allow outsiders to visit
			the ruins.
			Indeed. Especially since we still
			know so little about their
			origin...
			Hopefully, I've been able to
			construct some intriguing theories
			of my own.
			I'm sure the council members will
			agree that you have.
			Your support is appreciated,
			Deanna.
			Screen off.
			Bring back any memories?
			Vash? How did you get in here?
			I came in through the window.
			I had no idea you were a member
			of the Archaeology Council.
			You are a member?
			Aren't you.
			More or less.
			Why have you come to Tagus Three?
			To see you, of course.
			Is that the only reason?
			Isn't it enough?
			I wish I could believe you?
			I'd be disappointed if you did.
			I really have missed you,
			Jean-Luc.
			Come.
			I'm sorry I'm late...
			Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you
			had company.
			That's quite all right, Doctor.
			Beverly Crusher allow me to
			introduce Vash. A friend of mine
			with the Archeology Council.
			I didn't mean to interrupt. The
			Captain and I often share morning
			tea.
			Yes, Jean-Luc has told me all
			about you.
			Really? When was that?
			On Risa. Where we met.
			I see.
			That must have been during your
			vacation last year.
			So it was.
			I'm surprised he never mentioned
			you.
			So am I.
			Are you busy, Doctor?
			Not at the moment.
			I was wondering, I would love to
			see some more of this marvelous
			ship...
			I'd be delighted to show it to
			you. If that's alright with you,
			Jean-Luc.
			Of course.
			Don't worry, I promise to behave
			myself.
			And this is Ten Forward, where
			the Council's welcoming reception
			is to be held this afternoon.
			I couldn't think of a better
			location.
			Tell me, does Jean-Luc come here
			often?
			No, not often.
			I didn't think so.
			The Captain is a very private man.
			He certainly acted that way when
			we first met.
			But I managed to loosen him up.
			Would you like something to drink?
			Please.
			Eternity never looked so lovely.
			Excuse me?
			I was referring to the view.
			Eternity never looked so lovely.
			You must be Commander Riker.
			I'm afraid you have me at a
			disadvantage.
			I didn't mean to interrupt. I
			believe you were about to tell
			me that my eyes are as mysterious
			as the stars.
			You're a Betazoid.
			Not at all. It's just that
			Jean-Luc does quite a good
			imitation of you.
			He does?
			I see you two have met.
			Not exactly.
			Vash is a member of the Archeology
			Council. And a friend of the
			Captain.
			So I've gathered.
			They met during his visit to Risa.
			On Risa?
			That must have been a better
			vacation than he let on.
			You mean he never mentioned me
			to you either?
			Believe me, if he had, I would
			have remembered.
			You'd think he'd have told someone
			about me.
			Doctor Crusher, please report to
			Sickbay.
			On my way.
			I'm afraid I won't be able to
			finish up our tour.
			Perhaps Commander Riker could fill
			in for me.
			It would be my pleasure.
			So you're the one who asked
			Jean-Luc to buy the Horga'han.
			That was me.
			Tell me Commander, do you collect
			sexual fertility symbols?
			I wouldn't call it a very large
			collection.
			And that brings us to the Main
			Bridge, the Command center of the
			Enterprise, and the end of our
			tour.
			Vash, I'd like you to meet
			Commander La Forge and Commander
			Data...
			And this is Lieutenant Worf.
			Something wrong, Lieutenant?
			Sir, I was not informed that
			Council Members had been granted
			bridge clearance.
			I think we can make an exception
			in this case, Mister Worf. Vash
			is the Captain's guest.
			Welcome aboard.
			Is this where Jean-Luc sits?
			That's the big chair.
			I can see where being a starship
			Captain does have its rewards.
			I'm glad you approve.
			Jean-Luc. Commander Riker was
			just showing me the bridge.
			Doctor Crusher was called to
			Sickbay.
			So, did you enjoy your tour?
			Very much.
			Good.
			I guess I'll head back to my room
			now and get ready for the
			reception.
			By all means.
			Well, I suppose I'll see you then.
			I look forward to it.
			Fascinating woman.
			You find something humorous,
			Geordi?
			Didn't you notice how ill-at-ease
			the Captain seemed around Vash?
			Yes. However I see nothing
			amusing in his hostility toward
			her.
			That wasn't hostility, Data.
			He likes her.
			A lot.
			I don't understand, I thought
			being ship's counselor meant the
			Captain confided in you.
			He does. When he feels it's
			necessary.
			And he never spoke to you about
			me?
			Not that I can recall.
			Not even a hint?
			You must understand, the Captain
			is a very...
			Private man.
			I know...
			Will you excuse me?
			Certainly.
			Nice legs.
			For a human.
			I agree, the Vulcan excavations
			on Tagus Three were extensive.
			Unfortunately, they were confined
			to the northeastern part of the
			city.
			Jean-Luc, we need to talk.
			Pardon me.
			The reception seems to be a
			success.
			Forget the reception for a moment.
			How come you've never mentioned
			me to your friends?
			What would you have me tell them?
			Maybe that we met, for one thing.
			That we had an adventure together.
			Some fun...
			I'm afraid that wasn't possible.
			Why not?
			It would have
			been... inappropriate.
			I wasn't expecting you to go into
			any intimate details.
			A Captain does not share his
			personal feelings with his crew.
			Is that a Starfleet regulation?
			Or did you make that one up
			yourself?
			I'm sorry if you're upset.
			And I'm sorry if my being here
			embarrasses you.
			How was the reception?
			Splendid.
			Jean-Luc! How wonderful to see
			you again.
			Well don't just stand there, say
			something.
			Get out of my chair.
			I was hoping for something more
			along the lines of "Welcome back,
			Q. It's a pleasure to see you
			again old friend."
			We are not friends.
			You wound me, mon Capitain.
			There, perhaps now your manners
			will show some improvement.
			What brings you here, Q? Have you
			been banished from the Continuum
			once again?
			Hardly. They're still apologizing
			to me for the last time.
			Then what is it you want?
			Must I always have a reason to
			stop by. I was in the sector
			and...
			Alright. You force a confession
			from me. The truth is I have a
			debt to settle.
			A debt?
			To you, Picard. And it gnaws at
			me. It interferes with each day.
			I have no idea what you're talking
			about...
			Without your assistance at our
			last encounter, I never would
			have survived. I would have taken
			my own life but for you, Jean-Luc.
			We all make mistakes.
			Your good deed made possible my
			reinstatement into the continuum.
			And I resent owing you
			anything... so I'm here to pay
			up... what shall it be... tell
			me and I'll be gone...
			Just be gone. That will suffice
			nicely.
			No, it must be something...
			something...
			...constructive. My new word for
			the day.
			Some other time, all right?
			Right now I have several things
			to attend to.
			Yes, your speech. I've read it.
			I found it dull and pedantic.
			Much like yourself.
			I could help you with it.
			No.
			You've never actually been to the
			ruins in Tagus Three, have you?
			They've been sealed off for over
			a century.
			How can you write about what you
			haven't seen?
			I'll take you there!
			Impossible. That would mean
			breaking Taguan law.
			Must you always be so ethical?
			I suppose we could travel back
			in time. You could see what Tagus
			was like two billion years ago.
			They really knew how to have fun
			in those days.
			I'm afraid my answer is still no.
			My lecture will have to stand on
			its own. Now, will you please
			leave my ship.
			Then you refuse my help?
			Completely.
			You're simply impossible to find
			a gift for, Picard.
			Commander Riker, report to my
			Ready Room.
			Yes, Captain?
			I've just been paid a visit by
			Q.
			Q?
			Any idea what he's up to?
			He wants to do something nice for
			me.
			I'll alert the crew.
			Who's there?
			It's me.
			Who?
			Jean-Luc.
			Yes.
			May I come in?
			What for?
			To talk.
			I'm listening.
			If it's all the same to you I'd
			rather this discussion not take
			place in a public corridor.
			I thought these were "private"
			quarters.
			And I thought I was the only
			reason you came to Tagus.
			I never fooled you for a second.
			Still, you are the most important
			reason.
			Am I?
			That's the trouble with being such
			a well known liar. Even when I
			tell the truth no one believes
			me.
			I'm afraid all this equipment will
			have to be confiscated.
			Is that necessary?
			I could have you placed in the
			brig.
			Why don't you?
			If the Taguans were to catch you
			down there...
			You gave me the same warning about
			Sarathong Five.
			I remember.
			Well, it didn't stop me from going
			there. I brought back some very
			impressive artifacts, too.
			Which you no doubt sold for a nice
			profit.
			It's what I do!
			Not while you're aboard my ship.
			I will not allow it.
			Let's get one thing straight,
			Picard. I can not change who
			I am for you or anyone else.
			Nor can I change who I am.
			Then we have nothing more to say
			to each other.
			So it would seem.
			What do you think it is?
			What do I think what is?
			About her. That, you know, gets
			to the Captain.
			Perhaps it is their common
			interest in archaeology.
			I don't think so.
			But Counselor, as an
			archaeologist, her company would
			certainly be intellectually
			stimulating to the Captain.
			She's not just stimulating his
			intellect, Data...
			It's really none of our business.
			You want to know about Picard and
			that woman? I'll tell you...
			It's love.
			Sleeping alone, Picard?
			I'm in no mood for your
			foolishness, Q.
			I thought there was something
			different about you. You seemed
			tense, preoccupied. Somewhat...
			smaller.
			At first I thought it was that
			horrible lecture of yours. But
			I was mistaken.
			Whatever game you want to play
			will have to wait until tomorrow.
			I had such hopes for you,
			Jean-Luc. I thought you were a
			bit more evolved than the rest
			of your species. But now I
			realize you're as weak as all the
			others.
			Still, it pains me to see the
			great Picard brought down by a
			woman.
			What woman?
			Don't play coy with me Captain.
			I witnessed your little spat with
			Vash. Nor will I soon forget that
			look of misery on your face. The
			pain. The anguish. If I didn't
			know better I would have thought
			you were already married.
			You really must be bored, Q.
			You're letting your imagination
			run away with you.
			This human emotion of Love is
			a dangerous thing, Picard. You
			are obviously ill equipped to
			handle it. She's found a
			vulnerability in you... a
			vulnerability that I've wanted
			to find for years. If I had known
			this sooner, I would have arrived
			as a female. Mark my words,
			Jean-Luc, this is your Achilles
			heel..
			Believe what you wish.
			You deny you care for this woman?
			Believe me, Picard, I'd be doing
			you a big favor if I simply turned
			her into a Klabnian eel.
			Stay away from her, Q.
			I only want to help... my debt
			to you...
			... is hereby nullified. I don't
			want your help... your advice...
			your favors... or for that matter
			-- you. Can you understand that
			once and for all?
			You would have me stand idly by
			while she leads you to your
			destruction?
			Yes!
			As you wish.
			Knock 'em dead, Captain.
			Ladies and gentlemen, members of
			the Archeology Council. Welcome.
			It is the mystery of Tagus Three
			that brings us together today...
			a mystery that has invited more
			argument and deduction than the
			best Sherlock Holmes or Dixon Hill
			tale. Well, if you'll excuse the
			conceit, you're about to hear my
			own detective story.
			For several years, I have been
			trying to unravel the secrets of
			Tagus Three. Needless to say,
			I have not succeeded.
			However, I have, I believe,
			turned up some new information,
			that if nothing else, raises a
			whole new set of mysteries that
			I hope we can discuss during our
			time togther.
			There have been nine hundred and
			forty-seven known Archaeological
			excavations conducted on the
			planet's surface.
			Out of that number some
			seventy-four are generally
			considered to have revealed
			findings of major importance.
			The earliest took place some
			twenty-two thousand years ago.
			The last was completed within
			the last four hundred years.
			What the hell... !
			Q!
			Is this Tagus Three?
			I doubt there are many oak trees
			on Tagus. No, my guess is this
			is supposed to be Earth.
			Sometime around the twelfth
			century. And this is England,
			Sherwood Forest to be precise.
			Or at least Q's re-creation of
			it.
			That explains these costumes.
			Exactly, Number One.
			Or should I say, John Little.
			If he's Little John, that would
			make you...
			I know. Robin Hood.
			Sir, I protest. I am not a merry
			man.
			On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf,
			your clothing identifies you with
			the character of Will Scarlett.
			Just as Geordi's Mandolin suggests
			he is Alan-A-Dale.
			And you, Mister Data, bear a
			striking resemblance to one Friar
			Tuck.
			I will not play the fool for Q's
			amusement.
			You're quite right, Worf.
			Do you hear that Q? You may as
			well return us to our ship
			immediately.
			I have you at last, Robin Hood.
			Quick. Into the forest.
			Mister Worf. That's an order.
			Enough, you fools. We'll never
			find them in the greenwood.
			I've managed to stop the
			bleeding.
			It's about time you showed up,
			Q.
			I'd prefer it if you addressed
			me as His Honor the High Sheriff
			of Nottingham.
			We will not share in this
			pointless fantasy of yours.
			Fine. Wait here and do nothing.
			By mid-day tomorrow, you'll all
			be safely back aboard your ship.
			But you will have to accept the
			consequences of your inaction.
			What consequences?
			What's the one thing Robin Hood
			is famous for?
			Robbing from the rich to give to
			the poor?
			Besides that.
			Are you referring to his rescue
			of Maid Marian from Nottingham
			Castle?
			Right you are, Data.
			And it just so happens that Sir
			Guy of Gisbourne has decreed that
			Marian's head comes off tomorrow
			at noon.
			Vash.
			The choice is yours my dear,
			Robin. You can either take your
			ease here within the sylvan glade
			or risk your life to save a woman
			you care nothing about.
			My feelings toward Vash are
			irrelevant. I'd attempt to save
			any innocent life, as you well
			know.
			But what of your merry men? Are
			you willing to put them in
			jeopardy as well? Is Vash's life
			worth losing hers or his or even
			his... ?
			Though I admit he would make a
			perfect throw rug at Nottingham
			Castle.
			Q, I ask you to end this now,
			before anyone else gets hurt.
			Impossible. You see, I've given
			this fantasy as you call it, a
			life of its own. I don't know
			how things will turn out anymore
			than you do.
			But of one thing I am certain.
			If you dare set foot in Nottingham
			Castle, blood will be spilled.
			You'll wear yourself out with
			all that pacing, M'lady.
			I told you to stop calling me
			that. My name's Vash.
			My poor lamb, it's a brain
			sickness you've got for sure.
			Can't I get you something to ease
			your suffering?
			I could use a drink.
			It wasn't spirits I was thinking
			of M'lady.
			I have here some nice fresh
			leeches to drain the fever.
			Out. Get out.
			Oh, her mind's in an awful
			turmoil, Sir Guy.
			Who the hell are you?
			M'Lady, everyone in Nottingham
			knows, Sir Guy of Gisbourne.
			Sir Guy of what?
			Do not mock me, Lady Marian. I'm
			prepared to offer you one final
			chance to change your mind.
			Will you marry me?
			I see. Then the execution will
			proceed as scheduled.
			What execution?
			I warn you Marian, this pathetic
			attempt at feigning madness will
			not save your life.
			You mean I'm the one getting
			executed?
			Sir Guy, wait? Can't we talk this
			over?
			I admit, I haven't been myself
			lately.
			Perhaps we've both been acting
			a bit hasty.
			Please.
			Data, are you alright?
			The arrow impacted just above
			my sixth intercostal support,
			penetrating my secondary
			subprocessor.
			Fortunately, none of my
			biofunctions seem impaired.
			Do not get discouraged. I believe
			your aim is improving.
			Sorry.
			It's about time we got out of
			here, sir.
			Not we Commander. You and the
			others are to wait here until I
			return.
			You're not planning to go after
			her alone, are you?
			This is not a mission. It's
			personal, between Q and myself.
			I don't want any of you involved.
			But Captain...
			You have your orders, Commander.
			I expect you to follow them.
			A touch sharper, shall we?
			Such benevolence, Sir Guy,
			allowing the condemned prisoner
			fresh air.
			You're mistaken, Sheriff. Maid
			Marian has consented to be my
			wife.
			But that's impossible?
			Not at all. Though I admit a
			maiden seldom has the opportunity
			to win herself such a noble
			husband.
			A toast to the most beautiful
			bride-to-be in all of England.
			Hold there, Sir Guy.
			Have you taken leave of your
			senses?
			It could be poisoned. Some foul
			scheme of Robin Hood. She's in
			league with him still, I'll
			warrant.
			Robin Hood?
			Oh, Robin Hood... that was over
			long ago.
			Why, all of Nottingham knows you're
			in love with him.
			That's a lie.
			He... bewitched me. Put me under
			some evil spell.
			Just as I suspected.
			You can add sorcery to the list
			of charges against that rogue.
			But Sir Guy, if anyone has been
			bewitched it's you.
			Silence. Any further impudence
			and it'll be your head on the
			chopping block.
			Guards, escort the Lady Marian
			to her chamber.
			But I'd much rather stay with you.
			Of course you would, my child.
			But I have important business to
			discuss with the Sheriff.
			And you must prepare for your
			wedding.
			I count the hours.
			Lovely creature.
			She is intriguing.
			Sir Guy, perhaps it would be wise
			to keep this wedding a secret for
			now.
			What are you babbling about?
			You still hope to capture Robin
			Hood, don't you?
			I live for the moment.
			Well, if he were to hear that
			Marian's life was no longer in
			danger, there would be no need
			for him to come to Nottingham to
			rescue her.
			By heavens, you're right. No word
			of my wedding shall leave these
			walls.
			What better way to celebrate a
			marriage than with an execution.
			This could be fun.
			Jean-Luc. Am I glad to see you.
			You would not believe what I've
			been through. One minute I'm on
			the Enterprise... the next thing
			I know I'm here in Nottingham.
			First, they're going to chop my
			head off... and now I'm supposed
			to marry someone named Sir Guy...
			and everyone insists on calling
			me Marian...
			Yes, I know.
			You do? But how...
			You're Robin Hood?
			My staff and I were brought here
			by an old adversary of mine named
			Q. I'll tell you the rest once
			we're safe.
			Come, we don't have much time.
			Are the others outside?
			They're waiting for us back in
			Sherwood.
			You mean you came alone?
			Yes, now let's...
			What kind of plan is that?
			An excellent one if you'd only
			hurry up.
			You do realize our lives are at
			stake here.
			Only too well.
			And this is the best strategy
			you could come up with? One man
			against an entire castle.
			I suppose you know of a better
			one.
			How about this? You go. I'll
			stay here.
			And do what?
			Marry Sir Guy if I have to.
			That is brilliant.
			If there's a way to escape, I'll
			find it, eventually. With my head
			still attached.
			You don't really expect me to
			leave you here?
			I can take care of myself.
			Must you be so stubborn?
			There'll be no escape for you this
			time, Robin Hood.
			Behind me.
			You should have left while you
			had the chance.
			Well done, my dear.
			Consider it my wedding present
			to you.
			Congratulations, Gisbourne. I
			see you've snared the jackal.
			It's Marian who deserves the
			credit. Took him with his own
			sword.
			You sent for me, M'Lady?
			You must take this letter to
			Robin's men.
			You want me to go to Sherwood
			Forest? At this time of night?
			You'll leave immediately.
			But it's dark. I'll get lost.
			Besides, it's not safe. What with
			all them hedge robbers and worse
			lurking about.
			Please, this is urgent.
			You ask me, you'd be better off
			staying with Sir Guy. He's got
			a future. Why you'll be living
			in London before you know it.
			But you must go. Otherwise,
			they're going to kill him.
			How dare you come barging in here
			this way!
			I come to offer apologies for my
			harsh words earlier. I had no
			idea you were so ruthless. The
			cold blooded way you betrayed
			Robin was most impressive.
			That's most gracious of you.
			I admit I was surprised...
			Though perhaps not as surprised
			as Jean-Luc.
			You're Q.
			And you are a very interesting
			woman.
			What's this?
			Give me that.
			A letter to Riker?
			Quick... Come to Castle... Must save
			Captain...
			Why this is wonderful. Such
			marvelous duplicity. You
			certainly fooled Sir Guy. And
			me as well.
			I do believe you're worth further
			study.
			Am I?
			Unfortunately, we won't have the
			time.
			Guards!
			Take this traitor away.
			It appears there's going to be
			a double execution.
			My fault?
			Yes, your fault.
			We'd have been safe in Sherwood
			if you hadn't grabbed my sword.
			I grabbed it to prevent you from
			being killed.
			You should have never interfered.
			You were the one interfering.
			I was trying to rescue you.
			Next time don't bother.
			I won't.
			Don't you two ever stop arguing?
			Tell me Picard, as you stand here
			facing the termination of your
			insect existence, do you see what
			has led you to this end?
			Was she worth it?
			Can we just get this over with.
			Are you implying I'm not worth
			it?
			Your game was for my benefit,
			Q. She is innocent in all this.
			She is many things, none of them
			innocent.
			Let her go.
			Jean-Luc, you do care.
			A gallant gesture Picard. But
			a futile one.
			Farewell. I hope you'll both be
			happy together.
			You have been found guilty of
			outlawry and high treason. Do
			you have anything to say before
			sentencing is carried out?
			Ready them for the block.
			Too many of them. We'd never
			get to the Captain...
			Data, we need a diversion. Now.
			Please stand back, Commander.
			Microfusion cells can be somewhat
			dangerous under high
			temperatures...
			It's the outlaws. Robin's band.
			Guards. Take Marian to the
			tower.
			I'll have you know I'm the
			greatest swordsman in all of
			Nottingham.
			That's very impressive.
			But there's something you should
			know.
			And what would that be?
			I'm not from Nottingham.
			Jean-Luc.
			It's over, Q. Now get us out of
			here.
			My compliments, Captain. I doubt
			Robin Hood himself could have done
			better.
			If any of my people are hurt...
			Sadly, they're all fine... but
			the point is they could have been
			killed, and you might have been
			too... all for the "Love Of A
			Maid." My debt to you is paid,
			Picard, if you have learned how
			weak and vulnerable you really
			are... if you can finally see how
			"Love" brought out the worst in
			you...
			Nonsense. You're absolutely
			wrong. It brought out the best
			in him.
			His nobility, courage, self-sacrifice.
			His tenderness.
			You're good. Very good.
			Enough of this.
			Indeed.
			Everybody here?
			Where's Vash?
			Computer, locate Council Member
			Vash.
			Council Member Vash is not aboard
			the Enterprise.
			Hello, Jean-Luc.
			Well, this is a relief. I was
			afraid that Q...
			There were a few things he wanted
			to discuss with me.
			I'm surprised he wasn't too busy
			gloating over his victory.
			He was right about one thing,
			Jean-Luc. As ridiculous as it
			was, his game did prove how much
			you care.
			I may not share my feelings with
			my crew, but I do have them.
			I'm going to miss you, Picard.
			I wouldn't be surprised if our
			paths cross again.
			I'll see to it.
			So, where are you off to now?
			I haven't made up my mind.
			Remind you of someone you know?
			As a matter of fact... yes.
			We are going to have fun. I'll
			take you places no human could
			ever hope to see.
			Who can resist an offer like that?
			As payment in full for your debt
			to me, you will guarantee her
			safety...
			She will not be harmed, Jean-Luc.
			I promise you that.
			Well, aren't you going to kiss
			her good-bye?
			Oh, all right.
			Well aren't you?
			Goodbye, Jean-Luc.
