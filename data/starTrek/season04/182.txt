			Captain's Log, Stardate 44286.5.
			The Enterprise is conducting a
			security survey of the Onias
			Sector near the Neutral Zone.
			Despite being close to Romulan
			territory, our mission has been
			quiet and uneventful.
			Alright, Commander... you've got
			until your next birthday to get
			that right.
			Many things improve with age...
			maybe your trombone playing will
			be one of them.
			It's candle time, birthday boy.
			What did you wish for, Will?
			Music lessons.
			Mister Data, we'd better hurry or
			we'll miss Commander Riker's
			party.
			Yes, sir.
			I find it interesting how humans
			place so much importance on
			celebrating the day of their
			birth... a day one cannot possibly
			remember...
			Captain... I am detecting some
			unusual fluctuations in subspace
			frequencies.
			We had better take a look, Mister
			Data.
			It appears we are being probed.
			Source?
			The third planet of the Alpha
			Onias system. Our reports list
			it as presently uninhabited.
			Perhaps the reports were
			incorrect.
			Or perhaps the rumors of a secret
			Romulan base in this sector are
			true.
			Picard to Commander Riker.
			I apologize for interrupting your
			celebration, but I need an Away
			Team.
			Although Alpha Onias Three is a
			Class M planet, our survey teams
			have listed it as barren and
			inhospitable.
			Any life signs?
			No, sir... but we have traced some
			residual energy readings... to
			a cavern two kilometers beneath
			the surface.
			Romulans?
			It is possible. But I cannot be
			certain.
			I suppose you'll just have to go
			down there and find out.
			Worf, Geordi... you're with me.
			Number One... Happy Birthday.
			I'm detecting high levels of
			volcanic gases... sulphur dioxide,
			methane, hydrogen sulphide...
			Toxic?
			We're okay for now... But I
			wouldn't want to spend my vacation
			here.
			What about energy readings?
			Magnetic clutter is increasing.
			I cannot make an accurate
			determination.
			Same here. I'm getting some very
			confused readings...
			Bridge to Riker. Report. Please
			acknowledge.
			This is Riker.
			We're having trouble reading you.
			And we are having similar
			difficulties reading you, Number
			One. I am advising you...
			... and your team to transport
			up... At once...
			Good advice, Commander. We've
			got a sudden build-up of gases
			here... especially methane.
			Transporter Room, take us up.
			I can't get a solid lock on you,
			sir. Too much interference.
			Transporter Room... What's
			happening? Report!
			I'm trying again, sir.
			Doctor Crusher... He's awake.
			Beverly?
			You remember me... that's good.
			What else can you remember,
			Captain?
			Captain?
			Water. Three Celsius.
			How do you feel?
			Confused.
			Understandable... considering
			what's happened.
			What has happened... to this
			Sickbay... to you... to me?
			Sit down, Captain.
			I am not "Captain." I'm
			Commander... Commander Will
			Riker. What's going on here?
			Sit... Please.
			What is the last thing you
			remember clearly?
			Alpha Onias Three. The Enterprise
			had been probed... Geordi, Worf,
			and I transported down to track
			the source.
			But all you found was toxic gas.
			They barely got the three of you
			out in time.
			Will... that happened sixteen
			years ago.
			That's not possible!
			With an Altarian virus, anything
			is possible. In fact, we expected
			this.
			Could you be more specific?
			That day on Onias Three you were
			infected with a strain of Altarian
			encephalitis. A retrovirus that
			incorporates its DNA directly into
			the cells of its host. It can
			lie dormant for years, then
			suddenly become active, as it did
			in your case ten days ago.
			You've been in a coma,
			delirious... Your fever finally
			broke this morning...
			But what happened to my memory?
			This is a scan of your brain
			tissue. When the encephalitis
			became active... it caused
			widespread synapse degradation,
			interrupting the consolidation
			of memory...
			Doctor.
			Will... this virus invariably
			destroys all memory back to the
			moment of the original infection.
			In your case, all the way back
			to Alpha Onias Three.
			I can't believe this... it's a
			dream... or...
			Feel my hand... flesh and bone.
			This is not a dream... and you
			are Captain William T. Riker...
			in command of the Enterprise.
			The Enterprise... for how long?
			Nine years.
			If I've lost my memory... how do
			I find it again?
			Memory is formed out of
			association. Smells, sounds, and
			images in the present could
			possibly trigger them.
			Like the way a song can remind
			you of... old friends...
			Exactly. In associational
			therapy, we expose the patient
			to familiar surroundings. This
			could stimulate the brain's neural
			synapses into regenerating.
			Then let's get started. There's
			nothing more familiar to me than
			the Enterprise. If anything's
			going to bring back...
			Will... I said your memory could
			return. In many of these cases...
			the damage is permanent.
			What about Geordi and Worf? Were
			they infected, too?
			Thankfully, no. Geordi appears
			to have been immune and the virus
			has no effect on Klingons.
			Speaking of Klingons...
			There have been a lot of changes
			on the Enterprise in the last
			sixteen years.
			Which is why we should begin the
			associational therapy in your
			quarters. Personal recollections
			are always the most vivid.
			Deck Eight.
			Belay that.
			My life is on the Bridge, always
			has been. If anything's going
			to jog my memory...
			Main Bridge.
			Repeat command.
			I said, Main Bridge.
			The computer has been slow all
			morning. A processing
			accelerator is down.
			Commander La Forge is running a
			Level-1 diagnostic to isolate
			the problem.
			Geordi...
			Good to see you up and about
			again, sir.
			Geordi... your eyes... what
			happened to your VISOR... ?
			My VISOR? I...
			Sorry, sir. Doctor Crusher warned
			us... you might not remember.
			I don't need my VISOR, Captain...
			not since I got these cloned
			implants...
			Captain.
			Welcome back, Captain. We did
			not expect to see you on the
			Bridge so soon.
			Commander Data... You are my First
			Officer?
			You remember, sir?
			No, Data. Not a single day of
			the last sixteen years.
			Warbird Uncloaking.
			On screen.
			Shields up. Go to Red Alert.
			Captain... we have been expecting
			the Decius. There is no need for
			alarm.
			Cancel Red Alert.
			Clearly, I need to be... briefed.
			The Decius is hailing us, Captain.
			The Admiral wishes to speak to
			you.
			On screen.
			Will!
			Admiral... Picard. Deanna.
			How are you feeling?
			I've felt better.
			Not surprising. Altarian Viruses
			can be a nasty business.
			That's... an understatement...
			I can't even...
			We can discuss this... after we
			transport over. Picard out.
			Transporter Room Six.
			How are you holding up?
			I could get used to the idea of
			a Ferengi Ensign... but Admiral
			Picard... on a Romulan Warbird?
			What is that all about?
			I think I should leave the
			explanations to the Admiral.
			Whenever you're ready, Chief.
			Captain Riker... it's good to see
			you have recovered.
			I'm not exactly sure you can call
			it a recovery, sir.
			Then there was... a memory loss.
			How much?
			Everything... since Alpha Onias
			Three.
			To lose sixteen years...
			... that is almost beyond belief.
			I'm having trouble believing it
			myself, Admiral.
			It must be overwhelming to have
			so much of your life...
			missing...
			And it couldn't have happened at
			a worse time. A few more days
			of relatively simple negotiations,
			and the treaty will be signed.
			What negotiations? What treaty?
			Sorry. I'll start at the
			beginning, which was four years
			ago. A Romulan battle cruiser
			strayed into Federation space.
			Its warp coils had collapsed, and
			its life support was failing.
			You saved them, Will. You and
			the Enterprise.
			This impressed the Romulans, to
			say the least. After years of
			distrust and conflict, they
			started to talk. You have been
			our key spokesman...
			... in securing an alliance with
			the Romulans.
			How far have these negotiations
			progressed?
			The preliminaries are over. All
			we need do now is escort the
			Romulan Ambassador to the final
			session.
			Where you will help complete the
			negotiations and sign the treaty.
			Captain, excuse me, sir, I mean
			Admiral... I am in no condition
			to negotiate with the Romulans
			or anyone else.
			Will... you are of sound mind and
			body. If you were properly
			briefed, you could still fulfill
			your duties.
			With a sixteen year gap in my
			head?
			I know this has all been... a
			terrible shock... but we do need
			you.
			Sir, I'm not sure I'm... fit to
			resume command...
			I appreciate your candor and your
			concern. But despite your...
			affliction... there is still no
			one better equipped to deal with
			these Romulans than you.
			When do we leave?
			As soon as the Ambassador
			transports over from the Decius.
			I'll make the arrangements.
			We will get through this. As we
			have many times before.
			I hope so.
			Let me take you to your quarters.
			Good idea... I've had enough
			surprises for one day.
			Hi, Dad.
			... and then Mister Greenburg asked
			me about the Fornax Disaster, and
			I knew the Enterprise had saved
			all the colonists. But I didn't
			know...
			Here it is!
			... But I didn't know the exact
			Stardate their sun went nova.
			If you tell me, I'll write it
			down. That way I won't forget.
			You don't remember me... do you?
			I'm... sorry.
			I need to talk to your father,
			Jean-Luc. Could you leave us
			alone... for just a moment?
			Why didn't you warn me?
			Beverly hoped that meeting
			Jean-Luc like this might have
			an impact... help you remember.
			It had an impact alright...
			Give it time.
			Jean-Luc.
			The Admiral was very pleased when
			you chose that name. He is a
			wonderful boy.
			Deanna... where's his mother?
			She died two years ago... a
			shuttle accident. I'm sorry,
			Will.
			I have absolutely no recollection
			of her... what was she like?
			'Min' was very beautiful, of
			course. And strong, intelligent,
			patient...
			She had to be patient, if she was
			married to me.
			She was an excellent Captain's
			wife, and a very good ship's
			counselor.
			She took over after I left.
			I can't imagine you leaving the
			Enterprise.
			Admiral Picard offered me a
			position at Starfleet Command.
			It was a tremendous opportunity...
			I couldn't refuse.
			Will... What's important is that
			today, right now, you have a son
			who needs you. Spend time with
			him... you may find part of what
			you've lost.
			Pretty bad, huh?
			I've heard better.
			I've been practicing... but I
			still can't get a good tone.
			You're putting too much pressure
			on the mouthpiece. Relax. Just
			use the muscles you need.
			Show me again.
			Okay. Left hand like this. Right
			hand... like this.
			After sixteen years... you'd
			think I could get that right...
			Come on, Dad... you always make
			that mistake.
			Computer. Summarize service
			record. Riker, William T.,
			Captain. Beginning with... the
			Fornax Disaster.
			Please restate question.
			Service record. Riker, William
			T.
			Damn it.
			Dad... ?
			That computer time lag. I can't
			believe Geordi's still running
			his diagnostic...
			Is that what you wanted?
			Picard to Captain Riker. The
			Romulan Ambassador is ready to
			transport over from the Decius.
			On my way.
			I've got to go, Jean-Luc.
			Sure.
			Dad...
			Everything's going to be fine.
			Troi tells me you met Jean-Luc.
			How is my namesake holding up to
			all this?
			Better than I am.
			We did our best to prepare him.
			I'm trying to catch up with all
			this. I've still got a long way
			to go. A long way.
			Just follow my lead with the
			Ambassador. You'll do fine.
			The Decius reports the Ambassador
			is waiting to transport.
			Beam him aboard, chief.
			Enterprise to Decius... stand by
			for transport.
			Admiral Picard, Captain Riker...
			it's good to see you again.
			Ambassador Tomalak... Welcome
			aboard the Enterprise.
			Thank you, Admiral. It is an
			honor to be the first Romulan to
			freely walk about a Federation
			Starship.
			Ambassador... Tomalak? At Nelvana
			Three, he threatened to take the
			hull of the Enterprise home as
			a war trophy!
			That was a long time ago. Many
			things have changed. Including
			Tomalak.
			As soon as we arrive at your
			Outpost Twenty-Three, the final
			negotiations should go quickly.
			I agree, Ambassador. All of the
			difficult issues have been
			resolved.
			After much debate. Your Captain
			Riker is the kind of negotiator
			even the Ferengi should avoid.
			But we have come to an agreement
			both sides can live with. Thanks
			largely to Captain Riker.
			And we are grateful, Captain.
			The new alliance will greatly
			benefit my people.
			As I hope it will benefit mine.
			It will, Captain. It will.
			Main Bridge.
			The virus you contracted, Captain.
			You have fully recovered?
			I assure you Captain Riker is
			quite well. He's looking forward
			to attending the final
			negotiations... as planned.
			Excellent.
			The signing of this treaty will
			be an historic occasion. You,
			of all people, deserve to be
			there.
			Thank you... Ambassador.
			So... this is the Bridge of the
			Enterprise.
			And this, I assume, is your
			Tactical position. Impressive.
			Admiral, Deanna... I need a moment
			with you...
			... Commander Data, if you will,
			please accompany the Ambassador
			on his... tour.
			Certainly, sir.
			Excuse us, Ambassador.
			You may find this of interest,
			Ambassador...
			... These newly refined sensors
			are capable of pinpointing the
			power emissions of...
			Are you telling me you trust
			Tomalak?
			I trust the process we have built
			with the Romulans over the past
			four years. They have nothing
			to gain by betrayal.
			Are you sure? You yourself have
			said it's always like a chess game
			with the Romulans. Move and
			counter-move, guile and deceit
			--
			I sense no such dishonesty in
			Tomalak. He is sincere in his
			desire for peace. He wants this
			alliance. There is no cause for
			concern.
			No cause for concern? We're
			talking about revealing the
			location of Outpost Twenty-Three,
			the key to all our Neutral Zone
			defenses.
			Pardon my bluntness, Captain, but
			your information is out of date.
			The strategic importance of
			Outpost Twenty-Three is minimal.
			And has been for years.
			Doctor Crusher to Riker. Are
			you there, Captain?
			What is it, Doctor?
			Your son has been injured. He's
			been taken to Sickbay. You
			better come down here right away.
			Dad!
			Are you alright?
			I'm fine.
			What happened?
			It's broken... But we'll have
			it all taken care of in a minute.
			Now just take it easy on that arm
			for a while.
			How did you do this?
			I was in the gym... playing
			Parrises Squares... I fell off
			the ramp...
			Parrises Squares... at your
			age... ? You could have broken
			your neck!
			I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...
			Continue the compression
			attenuator for two more minutes.
			Yes, Doctor.
			Can I talk to you for a moment?
			I'll be right back.
			Will... how old were you when you
			started playing Parrises Squares?
			Alright... I was probably younger
			than he is...
			It's just that... For all
			practical purposes, this is my
			first day as a father... my son
			almost kills himself...
			He didn't almost kill himself...
			he just broke a wrist... like a
			lot of other boys who fall down.
			You're right... But it's...
			difficult.
			Difficult for you? What about
			Jean-Luc? Can you imagine how
			he must feel?
			You've lost sixteen years, but
			Jean-Luc has lost a lot more...
			his mother... and now his father.
			Good as new, Captain. You can
			take him home.
			Thanks.
			How's the arm?
			It's fine.
			Dad, I'm really sorry... I know
			you've got more important
			things...
			Nothing as important as this, son.
			Deck Eight.
			Halt.
			I know this must be... very hard
			for you.
			It's okay, Dad.
			Okay's not good enough.
			When I was your age... my own
			father... he wasn't there for
			me. And I needed him. I
			really... needed him.
			I always wondered what kind of
			father I'd be. I never felt quite
			ready. Maybe the idea even scared
			me a little.
			Scared... you?
			Yeah.
			But I must have gotten over it,
			huh? You're here.
			Resume.
			It's just important to me... that
			I don't... let you down, Jean-Luc.
			You never have, Dad... you've
			always been there for me.
			I'll have to take your word for
			that... because I don't remember
			any of it... Not your first
			tooth, your first step...
			nothing... And I want to
			remember.
			Guess there's only one thing to
			do. We've got to make some new
			memories...
			I don't know if it's still in the
			memory banks, but I used to have
			this great fishing program on the
			Holodeck...
			The Curtis Creek program?
			You know it?
			Sure. We've gone to Curtis Creek
			lots of times.
			Want to go again?
			You bet!
			Then as soon as the negotiations
			are out of the way, we're going
			fishing.
			Great!
			... Then Mom tried to net the fish,
			and she fell in the creek, too.
			And then you tried to pull us both
			out, and you fell in!
			I'm almost glad I can't remember
			that!
			Mom really liked Curtis Creek.
			We went there for picnics and
			stuff lots of times.
			What was she like... your Mom.
			She was great... I think about
			her a lot...
			I better go change.
			Computer. Display family record.
			Riker. William T. Limit to
			visuals.
			Computer. Display family record.
			Riker, Mrs. William T.
			Please restate request.
			What's wrong, Dad?
			The computer's still not acting
			right. I'm having trouble finding
			a visual record of your mother.
			But I know Mom's pictures are
			there. Did you give a Stardate?
			Computer. Display family record.
			Riker, Mrs. William T. Home file.
			Stardate 58416.
			'Min... Minuet?'
			Mom was beautiful, wasn't she?
			Yes...
			Dad... what's wrong?
			La Forge to Riker.
			Riker here.
			Captain... please come to the
			Bridge.
			On my way.
			What's the problem?
			I've had to shut down the warp
			engines, Captain.
			Why?
			The antimatter containment fields
			were fluctuating. Nothing to
			worry about, though.
			We're on the edge of the Neutral
			Zone on impulse power, and you're
			not concerned?
			I'll have the engines back on
			line in no time, sir.
			As fast as you tracked down that
			faulty processing accelerator?
			I'm running a Level One
			diagnostic...
			... for thirty hours... ? It's
			never taken you more than four.
			You're not capable of that kind of
			incompetence, La Forge.
			But, sir...
			Where did you get that scar?
			In combat, sir.
			What battle? When? Which unit,
			which sector?
			If we left immediately, when would
			we arrive at Outpost Twenty Three?
			At Warp One, in three days, four
			hours...
			How about at Warp Seven?
			At Warp Eight? At Warp Nine?
			What's wrong, Data? What happened
			to all those millions of
			calculations per second?
			Pardon me, sir... but I am
			receiving subspace interference
			which limits my abilities. I
			can't operate as quickly as...
			What did you say, Commander?
			I said I cannot operate --
			No. That's not what you said.
			You said "I can't." You used a
			contraction. Didn't you?
			Sir, I can explain --
			-- No you can't. Don't even try.
			Captain Riker, this is no way to
			act in front of Ambassador...
			Shut up!
			What did you say?
			Shut up, as in close your mouth,
			and stop talking.
			Will... I can sense how upset you
			are. You're angry, impatient
			--
			Back off, Deanna.
			Well... anyone else want to speak
			up. Or can we end this...
			charade?
			As you wish, Commander Riker.
			The charade is over.
			The Enterprise... my son... you
			created it all.
			With the help of our neural
			scanners... and what you would
			call a Holodeck.
			Now please tell me... how did you
			discover the truth? The future we
			constructed for you should have
			been... convincing.
			It wasn't. There was the computer
			time lag, for one thing.
			Unavoidable. Our scanners have
			a limited response time. So
			whenever you strayed from our...
			expectations...
			But surely that was not enough
			to...
			To smash your house of cards?
			No, it was the visual record of
			my "wife," Minuet. Bad move.
			But we chose someone from your
			past who is still alive... a
			woman you were extremely attracted
			to...
			Your mistake, Tomalak. Minuet
			was nothing more than a computer
			generated fantasy I once
			experienced on another Holodeck.
			Impossible. In your mind, that
			woman exists... physically. Your
			feelings toward her remain
			quite... passionate.
			She was part of a very special
			program.
			So much effort... so little
			accomplished.
			If Outpost Twenty-three is what
			you're after... Why didn't you
			just use your neural scanners to
			probe my mind?
			Our scanners are calibrated for
			Romulan brain patterns. When it
			comes to human brains, they are
			less efficient. There were gaps
			in the information we gathered
			from your memory.
			Gaps? After what I've just seen,
			I find that hard to believe.
			You recreated the Enterprise,
			the crew... every nuance, every
			sound, smell... perfectly
			accurate. I sure didn't notice
			any gaps...
			I don't buy it, Tomalak.
			We are wasting time.
			Bring him.
			When you and your colleagues
			transported to this planet, you
			were less than a kilometer from
			this base. Your capture was a
			simple matter.
			My colleagues... ?
			We allowed them to transport
			safely back to the Enterprise.
			But your signal was... diverted.
			My people won't stop looking for
			me, Tomalak.
			They already have.
			Please say hello to your son.
			Jean-Luc?
			That is not his name, of course.
			Nor have you ever really met him.
			We merely... used his image to
			augment your program.
			What have you done to him?
			While I am gone, please give
			careful thought to your situation.
			What's your name?
			Look... if we're going to get out
			of here, you've got to trust me...
			Easy... I won't hurt you.
			Who are you? How did you get
			here?
			My name is Will.
			Ethan...
			They brought me here... with my
			parents...
			We were at a research station on
			Miridian Six.
			Miridian Six... near the Neutral
			Zone? I thought it was
			uninhabited...
			The station was set up last year.
			Then the Romulans came...
			It's odd the Enterprise wasn't
			advised...
			Where are your parents, now?
			They took them away.
			Do you know why the Romulans are
			keeping you here?
			No...
			... I just want to get away.
			Ethan... I'll get us out of
			here...
			How? Even if we do get away,
			they'll find us.
			They found me when I escaped
			before.
			You escaped?
			I hid in a secret place... for
			weeks... but they caught me when
			I went out to find food.
			I want that information,
			Commander. I want the location
			of Outpost Twenty-Three.
			Very well. I have been given
			permission to use whatever means
			are necessary...
			Ethan... no!
			Stop him!
			Let me go...
			Don't!
			This secret hiding place of
			yours... ?
			This way...
			In here...
			Their sensors should have picked
			us up...
			They can't... I heard them say
			there's something in these
			rocks...
			Heavy metals?
			Right...
			When you escaped last time...
			how'd you manage it?
			I acted like I was sick... when
			the Romulans took me to the
			infirmary, I ran away.
			I was lucky... I found this place
			the same day.
			... The Romulans forgot all about
			this storeroom when they rebuilt
			the tunnels.
			After I got away last time...
			... I mapped out all their tunnels.
			Supply depot, communications,
			living quarters... and the shuttle
			bay.
			How many guards at the shuttle
			bay?
			Only two or three.
			Stealing a shuttle would get us
			nowhere... too easy for the
			Romulans to track one of their
			own ships.
			But we could break into
			communications. Send a message
			to the Enterprise.
			We can't do that... The
			transmitter is on a
			voice-activated security system!
			Do you know whose voice it
			accepts?
			Only Ambassador Tomalak.
			Who?
			Tomalak.
			Ambassador Tomalak.
			Tomalak is a Romulan Captain.
			The only time he was called
			"Ambassador" was in their Holodeck
			fantasy. How would you know about
			that?
			You... you told me about it.
			Who are you? What's your part
			in all this?
			They've found us!
			But you said their sensors didn't
			work in this tunnel.
			They must have fixed them. We've
			got to go!
			And where will we go, Ethan?
			To the shuttle bay! There's still
			time.
			No... I've had enough.
			Commander... surrender your
			weapon...
			No more games. No more fantasies.
			I'm not going to play anymore.
			It was never the Romulans... it
			was you all along, wasn't it?
			There is no question about it,
			sir. It is his signal.
			Picard to Riker... can you read
			me?
			Riker to Picard. I'm here.
			Are you all right?
			Yes... What about Worf and
			Geordi?
			We beamed them up an hour ago...
			They're fine.
			But we lost you in mid-transport.
			Where have you been? What is
			going on down there?
			I'm not sure, sir.
			But I think I'm about to find
			out... stand by.
			What should I call you? Ethan...
			Jean-Luc?
			It doesn't matter.
			This room... it's more than just
			a Holodeck, isn't it?
			Much more. The neural scanners
			read my mind... give me anything
			I want. Just like they tried
			to give you everything you
			wanted.
			What I wanted? You probed the
			Enterprise... lured us here...
			so you could play games with me.
			I didn't want any of that... you
			did. Why?
			My world was invaded... my
			people... killed. My mother
			brought me here... so our enemies
			would never find me.
			But they found her, didn't they?
			She knew they would never stop
			looking for her... So she made
			sure I would be safe...
			She left the scanners to protect
			me... and to give me everything
			I wanted.
			Everything... then why kidnap me?
			I wanted you to stay. It's been
			so long... I just wanted
			somebody... real. I... thought
			you would be happy... I'm
			sorry...
			I have to return to my ship.
			Come with me. You don't have
			to stay here anymore... you don't
			have to be alone anymore...
			My real name is Barash.
			To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc.
			Two to transport...
