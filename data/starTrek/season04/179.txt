			Chief Medical Officer's log,
			Stardate 44161.2. We are docked
			at Starbase One-Three-Three for
			scheduled crew rotation. I look
			forward to welcoming aboard my
			mentor, and dear friend, Doctor
			Dalen Quaice, who will be
			traveling with us to his home
			planet, Kenda Two.
			Dalen!
			It's good to see you again,
			Beverly.
			You look wonderful.
			A lie I can live with. It's kind
			of your captain to ferry me home.
			It's on our way.
			Thank you, Chief.
			My pleasure, Doctor.
			Dalen, I was sorry to hear about
			Patricia.
			She'd been ill for some time.
			Is her death the reason you're
			giving up your post here?
			We had a lifetime together, doing
			all the things we'd ever dreamed.
			And more. But when she was gone,
			I couldn't continue to work in
			that office, sleep in that bed
			without her... the absence of
			her was too... distracting...
			I'm not sure I'm making any sense.
			Jack and I didn't have a lifetime,
			only a few short years. But I
			understand. When you realize
			someone you love is lost
			forever...
			You know what the worst part of
			growing old is? So many of the
			people you've known all your
			life are gone... and you realize
			you didn't take the time to
			appreciate them while you still
			could...
			I'm sorry. There was no reason
			to heap all this emotional baggage
			on you.
			I usually travel light.
			Wes, time for the experiment is
			over... I want my warp engines
			back. Now.
			Almost done, Commander.
			Almost isn't good enough. You
			want to explain when the Captain
			says "Engage," and we just sit
			here?
			Just a couple more minutes! I'm
			ready to try the new warp field!
			Mom?
			Don't let me interrupt.
			Hi!
			Wes!
			Right! Okay!
			Computer, level two diagnostic
			on warp drive systems.
			Antimatter containment positive.
			Warp drive within normal
			parameters.
			Talk to me.
			That shouldn't have happened.
			Ensign Crusher --
			Why would there be any visible
			phenomena outside the drive?
			Umbilical disconnect.
			Are you done?
			Uh, yeah...
			Clear all moorings. Engineering,
			aft thrusters.
			Aft thrusters, aye. Impulse power
			to the helm.
			Dalen?
			Dalen, it's Beverly.
			Computer, current location of
			Doctor Dalen Quaice.
			There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice
			aboard the Enterprise.
			Doctor?
			Lieutenant Worf, yesterday, before
			we left starbase an old friend
			of mine came onboard: Doctor Dalen
			Quaice. I requested quarters for
			him. He was assigned here.
			I was not aware of this passenger.
			I'm sorry. I thought it was
			standard procedure for you to be
			notified once Captain Picard
			approved passage.
			It is. Please proceed.
			We were to meet for breakfast.
			But I can't seem to find him...
			or any of his things...
			Computer, where is Doctor Dalen
			Quaice?
			There is no Doctor Dalen Quaice
			aboard the Enterprise.
			Lieutenant, Doctor Quaice is very
			old, and rather frail. If he fell
			somewhere... if his communicator
			were damaged...
			I will order a search immediately.
			Thank you.
			Even if Doctor Quaice had been
			injured... why would his
			belongings be missing?
			Sir, I have several teams
			conducting a deck-by-deck search.
			It is not yet complete.
			I have scanned the entire ship,
			Captain. Other than the
			Enterprise's regular complement,
			I can find no one else onboard.
			Your sensors wouldn't detect
			him... if he were dead...
			That is correct, Doctor.
			Could your friend have returned
			to the starbase without telling
			you? An emergency of some sort?
			There were a lot of people going
			back and forth between the ship
			and the starbase yesterday.
			We can easily check the
			transporter I.D. traces.
			By all means check the trace
			log. But even if the results
			are negative, contact Starbase
			Command. We should leave nothing
			to chance.
			Yes, sir.
			Doctor, one moment please.
			I'm sure you are aware of
			procedures involving passengers.
			Of course. I don't know why
			Lieutenant Worf wasn't told about
			Doctor Quaice.
			I was not informed either.
			But I sent in a request weeks ago.
			I never received it.
			I'm sure I had a confirmation.
			Computer, search passenger
			requests. Doctor Dalen Quaice.
			Point of embarkation: Starbase
			One-Three-Three.
			No listing.
			Captain, I sent in that request.
			And it was approved.
			Then it must have been intercepted
			before it reached me.
			And someone else sent the
			approval? Why?
			Doctor Quaice had been stationed
			at the starbase for some time?
			Six years.
			It might be prudent to find out
			if he'd acquired any enemies
			there.
			On course for Durenia Four, sir.
			Very good, Number One. Mister
			Data?
			Sir, Starbase One-Three-Three has
			no record at all of a Doctor Dalen
			Quaice.
			I thought he was stationed there
			for six years.
			Not according to their computer.
			I have also accessed Starfleet
			records. There is no doctor
			currently serving in Starfleet
			named Quaice. In fact I cannot
			find any service record
			whatsoever. There are no birth
			records with that name. I find
			no --
			Data, I interned with him on Delos
			Four. I've known him for fifteen
			years.
			I do not doubt you, Doctor.
			However I have tried one hundred
			seventy-three phonetic variations
			of the name, and --
			His name is Dalen Quaice.
			Q-U-A-I-C-E. Whatever the records
			say, they're wrong.
			Mister Worf?
			Captain, we have completed our
			search. We cannot locate Doctor
			Quaice.
			You're not alone.
			He was onboard. I met him in
			Transporter Room Three myself.
			Then it appears, for reasons
			unknown, someone has gone to great
			pains to erase all traces of this
			man.
			Who was on transporter duty when
			he came aboard?
			Doctor Quaice? Was he part of
			the regular crew rotation?
			No. He's a friend of Doctor
			Crusher's.
			When did he arrive?
			Sixteen hundred hours yesterday.
			That was my watch. I beamed this
			man onboard?
			Yes. I was here to greet him.
			An elderly man? Not in the best
			of health?
			I'm sorry. I do remember you were
			here for a short while. But you
			were alone.
			Was he invisible? Did I carry
			on a conversation with thin air?
			No, Doctor. As far as I can
			recall, you came in, looked around
			for a few moments... I asked you
			if I could help you with
			anything... All you said was
			"Thank you." I said "My
			pleasure," or something. That
			was the end of it. There was no
			one else here.
			I can't accept that Chief O'Brien
			might be lying...
			He believes what he says. And
			there is no trace imprint for
			Doctor Quaice.
			Will, I didn't conjure up one of
			my best friends from a test tube.
			If the ship's records have been
			tampered with, then the
			transporter records could have
			been changed as well.
			And with everybody coming and
			going yesterday, maybe O'Brien
			just doesn't remember, or...
			Or?
			It might be a good idea to run
			a diagnostic on him.
			To make sure he hasn't been
			tampered with?
			What do you think?
			It's worth a try.
			I'll check the replicator activity
			logs -- eighteen hours is a long
			time to go without food. Or
			without someone seeing him.
			Chief, this examination should
			only take a few minutes.
			But I feel fine.
			Things are awfully quiet around
			here. Is everybody really that
			healthy?
			I'm not complaining.
			We should still have a full staff
			on duty.
			Sit down, over here...
			Doctor, it won't do any good to
			check my eyesight. I didn't see
			your friend.
			I'll be a little more
			comprehensive than that, Chief.
			Crusher to Doctor Hill.
			Respond please. Doctor Selar,
			what is your present location?
			Computer, current whereabouts of
			Doctors Hill and Selar.
			There is no Doctor Hill or Doctor
			Selar aboard the Enterprise.
			I'm afraid I don't understand.
			Your husband: Doctor Richard
			Hill...
			With all due respect, you're
			mistaken. I'm not married.
			Of course you are. Your husband
			is my staff osteopath. You came
			onboard together six months ago.
			I did report for duty six months
			ago. But I was alone.
			I am not married. I've never
			been married --
			-- except perhaps to exobiology.
			Doctors Hill and Selar, and four
			other members of my medical staff
			have all vanished. All record
			of their ever having been on the
			Enterprise has been excised from
			the computer's memory.
			Did they come aboard with Doctor
			Quaice?
			No. They've been here for months.
			But the two duty nurses don't
			remember them. Their families
			don't even remember them...
			As O'Brien didn't remember Doctor
			Quaice... ?
			I checked O'Brien thoroughly.
			I found no physiological
			abnormalities.
			Crusher to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead, Ensign.
			I'm in Engineering, sir. I think
			there's something here you'd
			better see. It might be
			connected to Doctor Quaice's
			disappearance.
			On my way.
			Number One, any progress?
			No one's seen him. The replicator
			in his quarters hasn't been used.
			Check shield and hull integrity
			for any sign of intruders...
			Yessir... but I have been closely
			monitoring onboard sensors...
			there has been no indication...
			Then give me a Level One
			diagnostic of all onboard sensors,
			and run a manual sweep for any
			anomalous airborne or
			electromagnetic readings. I want
			some answers.
			I've been experimenting with
			Kosinski's warp field equations...
			Trying to find a way to improve
			engine efficiency.
			I've read your reports.
			We did a test run while we were
			at the starbase.
			Here's what the computer recorded.
			This is the static warp field
			we created inside the warp drive.
			The experiment was designed to
			see if we could keep a bubble like
			this intact.
			As you'll see in a moment, we
			couldn't.
			There was a momentary flash of
			light. It was all over the
			spectrum.
			I remember that.
			Are you suggesting this bubble
			could have made Doctor Quaice
			disappear?
			If he were caught in it...
			yessir, it would seem to us like
			he'd disappeared.
			Where would he go?
			Who knows... he could even end
			up outside our space-time
			continuum...
			Was Doctor Quaice in Engineering
			during your experiment?
			No, sir.
			And this bubble never expanded
			beyond Engineering?
			Nossir.
			Then how could it have trapped
			Doctor Quaice or the others?
			Other people are missing?
			Yes, and they weren't anywhere
			near Engineering either.
			It doesn't make sense.
			And I doubt warp bubbles could
			alter computer records, or erase
			memories.
			Keep at it, Ensign, Mister La
			Forge. It's the only working
			theory we have for now.
			Has something else happened?
			Sickbay is totally empty.
			Apparently I no longer have any
			staff.
			And that surprises you, Doctor?
			Surprises me? I'll say it
			surprises me! There should be
			at least four members of my staff
			on duty at all times.
			I am afraid the ship's records
			do not concur.
			What are you talking about?
			You do not have a staff.
			You're telling me I'm the sole
			medical officer on a ship with
			over a thousand people on board?!
			Excuse me, Doctor, but the entire
			ship's complement is two hundred
			thirty.
			No. That's wrong! Whatever is
			happening is affecting your
			memories, too.
			Doctor, may I see you in my Ready
			Room?
			Beverly, you're saying this ship
			has lost nearly eight hundred of
			its personnel... ?
			I know how it must sound...
			None of the scans reveal any
			anomalies... there is no sign of
			an intruder... Wesley's experiment
			clearly did not have the scope
			to affect an entire starship...
			The Enterprise is in serious
			danger. You must believe me...
			I have no choice but to believe
			you. The safety of my crew is
			at stake. But I want to be
			sure...
			That I haven't lost my mind?
			I just examined myself... being
			the only doctor on board, I had
			to do it myself... there is no
			sign of dysfunction... yes,
			there's an elevation of adrenalin
			which I think is understandable...
			Did you find anything that might
			suggest why you're apparently the
			only one among us unaffected by
			this... phenomenon?
			No.
			I'll talk to Troi.
			It wouldn't do any harm.
			Jean-Luc, please... return to
			Starbase One-Three-Three for a
			full diagnostic. I realize you
			have only my word to convince
			you...
			Mister Riker, set a course to
			return to Starbase One-Three-Three
			immediately.
			Aye, sir.
			Your word has always been good
			enough for me.
			I've had a team in Sickbay for
			two hours. We've run the mass
			spectrometer on all
			particulates... we've scanned the
			EM spectrum in case a wave guide
			was somehow leaking radiation...
			we've even crawled into the life
			support ductwork... Captain, I
			don't know what this vortex was
			that Doctor Crusher saw...
			I didn't just see it. I felt it.
			I barely got away from it!
			Well, there's nothing there now.
			And no sign there ever was.
			Is there any possible connection
			to Mister Crusher's experiment...
			could this warp bubble be...
			floating around the ship
			perhaps...
			No, sir. The bubble was definitely
			contained in Engineering. There's
			no way it could affect something
			up on Deck Twelve.
			Sir, I have completed level-1
			computer diagnostics. There
			are no malfunctions.
			Any other ships respond to our
			queries, Data?
			The Wellington is the only
			Federation vessel in this
			sector... it reports normal
			operations. A Ferengi ship within
			communications range also reports
			nothing unusual.
			Have external sensors detected
			anything out of the ordinary?
			The interstellar medium in this
			sector is slightly denser than
			average. However, all readings
			are well within normal parameters.
			Are all members of the crew
			accounted for?
			Yes, doctor.
			How many are there?
			There are one hundred fourteen
			people on the Enterprise.
			That is the exact number there
			should be.
			There are now close to nine
			hundred missing.
			Deck after deck of this ship is
			now deserted. How do you explain
			all the empty rooms? If only a
			hundred fourteen people are
			supposed to be on board, why all
			the extra space?
			Transportation of colonists...
			diplomatic missions... emergency
			evacuations...
			Thank you, Mister Data.
			Have security confine all nonessential
			personnel to their
			quarters. Computer, Red Alert.
			Sir, I'd like Lieutenant Worf
			to program onboard sensors to
			monitor all personnel... if we
			can catch the exact moment someone
			disappears...
			Whom did you say?
			Worf... chief of security... the
			big guy who never smiles...
			Klingon?
			Deanna?
			I need you to tell me if I've gone
			completely mad.
			If you can ask the question, I'd
			say no.
			Don't evade the question.
			Then ask me one I can answer.
			Deanna, I've delivered babies who
			no longer exist! No one else
			remembers them. But I can close
			my eyes, and see their faces as
			clearly as I can see yours! What
			if it isn't some huge conspiracy?!
			What if it's just me?!
			What if it is just you?
			Then, I've delayed a mission,
			scared a lot of people...
			including me...
			So what?
			Beverly, you've acted in the best
			interests of your ship and crew.
			What more could you ask of
			yourself? If it turns out to be
			a... mistake... we'll be a little
			late to Durenia Four... that's
			all.
			It's not a mistake... I wish it
			were...
			When we reach Starbase, I'll order
			a complete workup: both physical
			and psychological.
			If we reach Starbase.
			Wesley... where's Wesley... ?
			Wesley!!
			Mom? You all right?
			No.
			We may have very little time
			left...
			You don't believe me...
			I don't know, Mom...
			I don't have time to convince you.
			Hundreds of people are gone and
			your experiment is the only
			possible explanation we have to
			work on right now...
			There it is. I don't know what
			else to do...
			Then find someone who does...
			someone who knows more about...
			about warp bubbles...
			I've already talked to Kosinski
			on subspace... he can't explain
			it either and it's all based on
			his equations. There is someone
			who might be able to help us, but
			I can't reach him.
			Who?
			He was Kosinski's assistant...
			an alien from Tau Alpha C... He
			said he was a "Traveler"...
			somehow he combined warp
			technology with the energy of his
			own thoughts...
			Yes, I remember... he took us
			where thoughts and reality became
			indistinguishable...
			Wesley, is it possible you've
			accidentally re-created something
			he did? Something that could
			alter reality?
			I don't see how. But he's the
			only one who could tell us...
			I've sent a message by subspace,
			but Tau Alpha C is so far away,
			it'll take days to get there.
			Maybe the Captain can help us...
			We've got to find him. Come on...
			I don't even know if he's still
			alive. He was sick.
			Wesley, it's a chance, we have
			to...
			-- try it...
			Nooooo... !
			They're all gone... ?
			Riker, Troi, Data... let me guess
			-- you've never heard of any of
			them.
			Doctor, I believe I have been
			more than fair. I have done
			everything I can to substantiate
			your... your perceptions --
			Will Riker! Your First Officer.
			He's very good at poker, likes
			to cook, listen to jazz, plays
			the trombone...
			I cannot find any evidence...
			... Commander Data, the android
			who sits here at Ops, dreams of
			being human, never gets the punch
			line to a joke... ?
			... Beverly, we'll be arriving at
			Starbase One-Three-Three in a few
			hours...
			... Deanna Troi, you ship's
			counselor, half-Betazoid, loves
			chocolate, the arrival of her
			mother makes you shudder? And
			Geordi, O'Brien, Worf... Wesley,
			my son -- They have been the
			living, breathing heart of this
			crew for over three years. They
			deserve better than to be shrugged
			off... brushed aside... to be
			pinched out of existence like
			this!
			They all do. All nine hundred.
			They deserve so much more...
			Perhaps you should confine
			yourself to Sickbay until we
			arrive...
			It's perfectly logical to you.
			The two of us roaming about the
			galaxy in the flagship of the
			Federation. No crew at all.
			We've never needed a crew before.
			I don't suppose you remember an
			alien from Tau Alpha C who was
			once onboard... called himself
			a Traveler... ?
			Jean-Luc, I don't know how, but
			you and I must find this Traveler
			or another from his race... if
			anyone can help us...
			You have my word... as soon as
			we return to the starbase, I'll
			make every effort to find him.
			This isn't a delusion. It isn't
			a dream. There is a physical,
			measurable phenomenon at work.
			Maybe you can help me identify
			it...
			How?
			I'd like to use the ship's
			computer to monitor your life
			functions.
			Until I disappear.
			It will happen.
			Very well. Computer, continuous
			scan: Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			vital signs. Audible readout.
			Begin now.
			One ten over seventy. One ten
			over seventy.
			I promise you I'll continue to
			do whatever I can to figure out
			what's happening, and to bring
			you all back.
			I'm sorry I lost my temper.
			You do remember that?
			Vividly. But if I have forgotten
			my closest friends and comrades,
			as you say, I deserved every word.
			For quite awhile now there's
			something I've been meaning to
			say to you. I may not get another
			chance. Jean-Luc, you and I --
			I won't forget. I won't forget
			any of you!
			I'm losing it... The link isn't
			holding, Commander!
			I'll try the secondary equations!
			No, it's too late. Look.
			I've lost it.
			I'm sorry, Wesley.
			It's over. We'll never get her
			back.
			It's not over, Wesley.
			There's still a way.
			Captain's log, Stardate 44162.5.
			Two attempts to retrieve Doctor
			Crusher have failed. And now the
			Traveler, a mysterious visitor
			from our past, has reappeared.
			And then I sent a message by
			subspace to Tau Alpha C asking
			for help... but I didn't think
			it would reach there for days...
			Actually, it didn't reach me...
			not by subspace...
			Then how did you know about the
			warp bubble?
			It would take too long to
			explain...
			Is she alive?
			As long as she thinks she is
			alive, she is alive.
			What the hell does that mean?
			Your species have very narrow
			perceptions of time and space and
			thought.
			When Beverly Crusher was caught
			in the static warp bubble, she
			created her own reality. Her
			thoughts at the precise moment
			she was trapped determined its
			shape and form.
			Can you go in and get her back?
			No, it is her reality. I cannot
			enter it... any more than I can
			enter her thoughts.
			But you said there's still a way.
			I can help, but I can't do it
			myself. Wesley, there is a power
			within each of us that most people
			haven't begun to realize... you
			have, or I would not have known
			to come here now...
			Together, we may be able to open
			a gateway for her. But she must
			choose to walk through it.
			Computer, we're going to apply
			precise diagnostic methodology.
			Once we've cataloged the symptoms,
			we'll proceed to determine the
			illness, and find a cure.
			We'll start with the assumption
			that I'm not crazy... if I am,
			it won't matter one way or the
			other...
			Computer, read the entire crew
			roster for the Enterprise.
			Doctor Beverly Crusher.
			Have I always been the only member
			of the crew on the Starship
			Enterprise?
			Affirmative.
			If this was a bad dream, would
			you tell me?
			That information is not available.
			What date did I report on board?
			Stardate 41154. Fourteen hundred
			hours, three minutes.
			That sounds about right.
			Computer, is there more than one
			U.S.S. Enterprise?
			This vessel is the fifth starship
			to bear the name U.S.S.
			Enterprise. It is currently the
			only one in service.
			What is the primary mission of
			the Starship Enterprise?
			To explore the galaxy.
			Do I have the necessary skills
			to complete that mission alone?
			Negative.
			Then why am I the only crew
			member?
			Aha, gotcha there...
			That information is not available.
			Computer, are you familiar with
			the inhabitants of Tau Alpha C?
			Affirmative.
			Are any presently located on a
			starbase or vessel within
			communication range?
			Negative.
			Estimated time to Tau Alpha C at
			warp nine-point-five...
			One hundred twenty-three days.
			Lay in a new course for Tau Alpha
			C. And send them a subspace
			message advising our arrival.
			Acknowledged.
			Engage.
			Computer, did you change course?
			State new destination or
			coordinates.
			I stated it, dammit... Tau Alpha
			C...
			There is no Tau Alpha C listed
			on current star maps...
			Captain's log, stardate 44162.8.
			At the direction of the Traveler,
			the Enterprise is returning to
			Starbase One-Three-Three and the
			precise position where the subspace
			bubble was formed.
			Our goal will be to create a
			stable gateway between our reality
			and your mother's reality...
			We've tried to stabilize it. The
			link won't hold.
			Of course not. The equations are
			only the first step. We will be
			going beyond mathematics.
			Just tell me what I have to do.
			It's nothing I can tell you,
			Wesley...
			Then how am I supposed to do it?
			You said you'd help.
			You must allow me to help.
			I don't know how.
			Begin by letting go of your guilt,
			Wesley.
			It was my fault. I should never
			have tried...
			Focus on the present. You will
			have to be here...
			completely... to help her back.
			You must open yourself to
			time and space and the intricate
			threads that bind them.
			Begin entering your warp field
			equations...
			Close your eyes.
			Continue to enter the equations...
			I don't have any more equations.
			See past the numbers. Trust
			yourself...
			I can't. I can't do it.
			When the time comes, you will,
			Wesley. You will. Now, begin
			again...
			Starbase One-Three-Three, this
			is the Enterprise.
			Starbase One-Three-Three, this
			is the Enterprise. Please
			acknowledge.
			Viewscreen on.
			It's not just people...
			Everything is disappearing!
			Computer, what is that... mist...
			I'm seeing?
			Sensors indicate it to be a
			mass-energy field seven hundred
			and five meters in diameter.
			It surrounds the ship?
			Affirmative.
			If there isn't anything wrong with
			me... maybe there's something
			wrong with the universe...
			Computer, what is beyond the
			mass-energy field?
			Sensors cannot penetrate the
			field.
			Computer, here's a question you
			shouldn't be able to answer...
			What is the nature of the
			universe?
			The universe is a spherical region
			seven hundred and five meters in
			diameter.
			Approaching Starbase One-Three-
			Three, Captain...
			Slow to ten meters per second.
			Mister La Forge, prepare for
			precision station-keeping.
			Acknowledged. Readying thrusters.
			There... there it is...
			We're moving into phase now
			(tech)... there's your warp
			bubble, Wesley...
			What? What's wrong.
			It's collapsing.
			Computer, give me a graphic
			representation of the universe.
			I've seen that before...
			Wesley's experiment... the bubble.
			Of course... But that would mean
			I'm the one trapped in the
			bubble...
			Computer, what's happening?
			Explosive decompression: Decks
			Five through Fourteen. Sealing
			off forward sections.
			Cause?
			A flaw in the ship's design.
			Show me.
			Analysis... ?
			No ship's structures exist forward
			of Bulkhead Three-Four-Two.

			over this one. Same scale. And
			continue to monitor.
			It's collapsing...
			Hull integrity now compromised
			on Decks Three through Fifteen.
			How long can life support be
			maintained?
			Four minutes, seventeen seconds.
			Sir, we have reestablished the
			exact coordinates and attitude.
			Geordi, we're in position... your
			status?
			The warp bubble is contracting
			at a rate of fifteen meters per
			second... we'll lose it in about
			four minutes...
			It's time, Wesley.
			We're ready, Commander.
			Proceed.
			I'll be in Engineering.
			Let it go, Wesley... let go of
			the anticipation... the
			expectations... the demands upon
			yourself... let it all go...
			leave it behind.
			Yes. The ability is there...
			inside you... you don't need to
			look for it...
			Three minutes thirty seconds to
			life support failure.
			The Traveler used his thoughts
			to alter warp fields... and
			thoughts became reality... Now
			I'm in a warp field...
			Could my thoughts have changed
			this reality?
			Come on, Beverly! What's the next
			step?!
			What was I thinking at the
			moment Wesley's bubble formed?
			Dalen Quaice... He said... all
			the people he'd known were gone...
			I thought of Jack... I went to
			see Wesley... the flash in
			Engineering... And that's when
			it started... when I started
			losing everybody!
			My thoughts created this universe.
			Can they get me out of it again?
			That information is not available.
			I'm not talking to you.
			Click my heels together three
			times and I'm back in Kansas?
			Can it be that simple?
			No, it can't be that simple.
			Two minutes thirty seconds to life
			support failure.
			Computer, hypothetical
			situation... a person is trapped
			inside a static warp bubble.
			Determine a means of escape...
			Escape would theoretically depend
			on establishing a stable threshold
			between the warp field and the
			outer environment.
			Can you describe this threshold?
			Negative. There are no known
			practical applications of this
			theory.
			Extrapolate from theoretical
			database. How might it manifest
			itself?
			A dynamic atmospheric disturbance
			of great intensity.
			Disturbance? The vortex! They
			must have been trying to reach
			me! But how do I find it... ?
			Wesley, where do I go? Help me...
			Stable threshold... They've
			been trying to create a stable
			threshold. Where are they trying
			to do it?
			Where did they do it the first
			time? Engineering!
			One minute thirty seconds to life
			support failure.
			Engineering!
			Failure in Turboshaft Four.
			Unable to proceed to Main
			Engineering.
			Just get me anywhere on Deck
			Thirty-Six!
			We're losing the bubble...
			Jean-Luc...
			You...
			Do I have you to thank for getting
			me back?
			No.
			Captain, if I may ask: how many
			people are there onboard?
			One thousand fourteen, including
			your guest, Doctor Quaice.
			Is there something wrong with that
			count?
			No. That's the exact number
			there should be.
