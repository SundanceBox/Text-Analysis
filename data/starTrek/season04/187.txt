			You don't believe in me.
			I don't.
			What evidence would you have of
			my reality beyond that of your
			senses?
			I don't know.
			Why do you doubt your senses?
			Because a little thing affects
			them. A slight disorder of the
			stomach makes them cheats. You
			may be an undigested bit of beef,
			a blot of mustard, a crumb of
			cheese, a fragment of an underdone
			potato. There's more of gravy
			than of grave about you, whatever
			you are. Humbug, I tell you
			humbug!
			Freeze program.
			Very nicely done, Data... your
			performance skills really are
			improving...
			I have taken your advice, Captain.
			This time I have not imitated
			another actor's rendition. It
			was my own interpretation...
			And a very interesting one...
			you should be congratulated...
			Your courtesy is appreciated.
			But I am aware that I do not
			effectively convey the fear called
			for in this scene.
			Well, you've never known fear.
			But as an acute observer of
			behavior, you certainly should
			be able to approximate...
			Sir... That would not be an
			appropriate basis for an effective
			performance. Not by the standards
			set by my mentors.
			Your mentors... ?
			Yessir. I have studied the
			philosophies of virtually every
			known acting master, but I find
			myself particularly attracted to
			Stanislavsky, Adler, Garnav...
			proponents of a performance
			technique known as "The Method."
			"Method acting?" Yes, I'm vaguely
			familiar with it... why would you
			choose such an old-fashioned
			approach...
			Perhaps because the technique
			requires an actor to seek his own
			emotional awareness to understand
			the character he plays...
			But that would seem an impossible
			task for you, Data.
			I have modified the method for
			my own use, sir. Since I have
			no emotional awareness to create
			a performance, I am attempting
			to use performance to create an
			emotional awareness. I believe
			if I can learn to duplicate the
			fear of Ebenezer Scrooge, then
			I will be one step closer to
			being truly human.
			Captain Picard, please report to
			the Bridge...
			On my way, Number One...
			Data, the moment you decided to
			stop imitating other actors and
			to create your own
			interpretation... you were
			already one step closer to being
			truly human.
			We've received an emergency
			transmission from the Ventax Two
			science station...
			Nature of the emergency...
			Uncertain... the signal was
			interrupted by...
			Contact reestablished with Ventax
			Two, Commander.
			On screen.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the U.S.S. Enterprise. Please
			identify yourself.
			I am Doctor Howard Clark, director
			of the science station here on
			Ventax Two. Thank you for
			responding.
			Lieutenant Worf, can you improve
			our reception?
			The trouble is at the transmission
			source, sir.
			Doctor Clark, we can barely
			maintain communication with you.
			Can you boost the level of your
			power source?
			I'm afraid not, Captain. It's
			under attack.
			Under attack?
			There is a mob outside, trying
			to break into the station. The
			planet is in chaos. Looting.
			Fires...
			Ensign, set a new course for
			Ventax Two...
			Doctor Clark, what has caused the
			riots... ?
			Mass hysteria... it's impossible
			to explain... these people are
			all convinced their world is
			coming to an end... tomorrow.
			Please, we must have your
			immediate...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44474.5.
			We have reached Ventax Two and
			are attempting to contact the
			Federation science station, which
			at last report was under siege
			by a mob.
			They are transmitting again.
			On screen, before we lose contact.
			Enterprise, Enterprise! Do you
			read me? Emergency! We need
			help!
			Doctor Clark, this is Captain
			Picard. We are ready to beam you
			and your staff on board the...
			They're in! They're in!
			Transporter Room Three! Lock onto
			the station team and beam them
			aboard.
			I've locked onto Doctor Clark.
			I can't pick out the others. It's
			a mess down there.
			Beam up Doctor Clark by himself...
			Mister Worf, escort him to my
			ready room...
			Aye, sir.
			Number One, try to make some sense
			of this "mess."
			The people of Ventax Two live
			in an agrarian society. At least,
			they do now.
			What do you mean, "now?"
			It's an interesting
			anthropological question. One
			we were studying before the...
			trouble began. In their distant
			past the Ventaxian culture had
			achieved an extremely advanced
			scientific level, but a millennium
			ago they turned their backs on
			technology.
			Be careful, it's hot...
			So they reverted to a simpler
			existence... ?
			And have remained that way for
			centuries. First contact was made
			by a Klingon expedition seventy
			years ago. Since then, new
			technology has been available to
			the Ventaxians. They simply have
			no interest in it. There have
			been virtually no social problems
			to be found on this planet... in
			fact, I would have described their
			society as idyllic until...
			Until what, doctor?
			It's hard to believe...
			Several years ago, Acost Jared,
			the Ventaxian head of state,
			began to grow increasingly
			obsessed with the legend of
			"Ardra." With each passing day,
			he grew more anxious, until he
			talked about little else. "Ardra
			is coming back. Ardra will be
			here soon. We must all leave
			before Ardra returns."
			And who is Ardra?
			For all intents and purposes...
			... the devil.
			Captain, these people actually
			believe they've sold their souls
			to the devil.
			Riker to Captain Picard.
			Have you located the science team,
			Number One?
			Evidently they're being held
			hostage.
			Hostage...
			We have a Ventaxian leader on the
			viewscreen, name of Acost Jared.
			Jared, you must secure the release
			of my people. I can't believe
			you would allow this.
			Howard, my friend, you know how
			I abhor all acts of violence.
			But events are out of my control.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			Is there nothing you can do... ?
			As the hour of Ardra's return
			approaches, fear has overwhelmed
			my people...
			I've tried to explain to them that
			there is no evidence, no proof
			this... this mythic creature ever
			existed... let alone was about
			to return to enslave them...
			It has been a thousand years.
			The prophecies have come true...
			Prophecies?
			Ardra's arrival is supposed to
			be heralded by the "shaking of
			the cities"... there have been
			a series of geological tremors
			on the planet... minor quakes...
			nothing extraordinary...
			But poorly timed...
			There is more. For several nights
			there have been visions of
			Ardra... again, just as the
			contract said would occur before
			her return.
			Visions? Do you mean dreams?
			No. She has appeared. I myself
			have seen her.
			Jared, tell your people if our
			hostages are released, I am
			prepared to offer you Federation
			assistance should this Ardra
			return.
			I am afraid it will not matter.
			They know your weapons are useless
			against her, Captain. I will make
			inquiries concerning the hostages.
			The innocent should not suffer
			for our sins... But I can make
			no promises...
			This situation is deteriorating,
			Captain... people are approaching
			levels of anxiety that could lead
			to suicide...
			Mister Data, what do we know about
			this Ardra figure?
			She is a cornerstone of Ventaxian
			theology. It seems that Ardra
			came to Ventax Two and promised
			one thousand years of peace and
			prosperity. As her price, she
			would return and enslave the
			entire population. In the
			Ventaxian culture, it is
			considered bad luck to speak her
			name out loud. The threat "may
			Ardra come to your door" is
			considered a most insulting
			epithet.
			I've often puzzled over this dark
			legend. It simply doesn't fit in
			with the rest of Ventaxian
			mythology... which is sunny and
			joyous.
			Perhaps the Ardra myth is a result
			of their contact with the
			Klingons.
			Are you implying Klingons are not
			sunny and joyous?
			Ardra predates the Klingon
			influence on Ventax Two.
			There are ancient scrolls
			concerning Ardra that are stored
			in the Atheneum vaults...
			scholars study them... they have
			been of little public interest
			until recently...
			I think I should meet with Acost
			Jared... he's still our best hope
			for the release of the hostages.
			I'll arrange to have him
			transported aboard...
			No... I'm going down to the
			planet...
			Sir, you risk being taken as an
			additional hostage...
			Mister O'Brien can stay locked
			on our communicators and pull us
			out, if necessary. Mister Worf
			and Mister Data, you will
			accompany me... I'm hoping the
			hostages have not been moved
			far... if the opportunity
			presents itself we will move
			quickly...
			Yes, sir.
			Counselor, I'll want you with me
			too...
			Captain Picard! You shouldn't
			have come. Your life is in danger
			here...
			Jared, you must attempt to calm
			your people. There is no reason
			for panic.
			No reason... !
			If the tremors have frightened
			people... leading to this
			hysteria over Ardra... allow us
			to reassure them...
			We have scanned the tectonic
			stress patterns of your planet's
			crust... there is no evidence
			that the quakes pose any kind of
			threat...
			No, no, the threat is from
			Ardra... you cannot understand...
			If you can at least help us locate
			our people...
			She is here.
			Nonsense... it is only...
			Time's up.
			I am disappointed. I expected
			my tenants to take better care
			of my property.
			Ardra, most powerful one, I am
			Jared, Leader of Ventax Two. I
			take responsibility for all that
			displeases you. Please do not
			punish my people.
			Punish? Who said anything about
			punishing? I merely expect your
			end of our contract to be upheld.
			Thank you, Ardra.
			And don't talk like some ancient
			prophet around me, with "thees"
			and "thous" and "most powerful
			ones"... it was appealing for
			a few centuries but I bore easily.
			And stop cowering! When I want
			you on your knees, I'll let you
			know...
			Much better... a fine example for
			the others; who would you be?
			I am Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise.
			Keep up the good work.
			Now, the first thing we'll need
			is an accounting of all you've
			been accumulating for me...
			This form will provide guidelines
			for a full census of the
			population with emphasis on
			productivity and economic
			forecasts...
			Who are you?
			My, you are forceful, aren't you?
			Good. I like my men to be
			forceful. At least at the start.
			If your intent is intimidation,
			madame, you are not succeeding.
			That's all right. I like a
			challenge.
			An entire planet has been
			terrorized because of the
			suggestion that you are going to
			enslave the population...
			Well, it's true. Of course, I
			wouldn't put it so melodramatically.
			It's just a standard contract with
			an unusually long term.
			So, you do purport to be the
			mythic figure Ardra?
			I have many names my pale friend.
			I'm Mendora in the Berussian
			Cluster. Torak to the Drellians.
			The Klingons call me Fek'lhr.
			You are not Fek'lhr.
			Ah, but I am... I am the Guardian
			of Gre'thor. Where the dishonored
			go when they die.
			But here on Ventax Two, I am
			called Ardra. The same Ardra who
			negotiated a contract with these
			people... ten centuries ago today.
			Ah, you doubt me. A non-believer.
			Really, Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise, no
			doubt you have travelled the
			galaxy, encountered a diverse
			universe of creatures... Is there
			no room for the likes of me?
			I have encountered many with a
			more credible claim to being the
			devil than you, madame.
			The devil! Now there's one I
			haven't heard in a long time.
			You are an interesting one. In
			your soul, there is an insatiable
			quest for new experience and
			exploration. You will discover
			that I touch that need in you,
			Picard... that I can satisfy it
			in a way no woman has for you
			before...
			... and you will believe.
			You claim you were here a thousand
			years ago and negotiated a
			contract... ?
			That's correct.
			I'd like to see that contract...
			The scrolls of Ardra...
			A longwinded description of a very
			simple business arrangement. I
			did away with their wars, famine
			and economic ruin, and provided
			them a thousand years of paradise.
			My terms were clearly stated.
			They went into this with their
			eyes open. I'm sure you'll find
			everything is in order...
			You won't mind if we don't take
			your word for it... ? Jared, with
			Your permission, Mister Data will
			review the documents...
			thoroughly.
			It is no longer my decision.
			I have intrigued you, haven't I,
			Picard?
			I only remain here to secure
			the release of Federation
			hostages.
			Hostages? Is this true?
			Yes, Ardra. Panic gripped the
			people as the time of your return
			grew closer...
			Yes, I do have that effect on
			people. See that the hostages
			are released... Now!
			Immediately.
			Let us not cloud this with bit
			players, Picard. You will not
			leave because you find me
			irresistible.
			Enterprise, advise Doctor Clark
			that the hostages are being
			released...
			This is Clark. You did it,
			Captain, thank goodness...
			Goodness... had nothing to do with
			it.
			Enterprise, three to beam up.
			Mister Data will remain on the
			surface...
			I want a complete report on the
			contents of these scrolls. I
			will not abandon this planet to
			that woman.
			Could she be another refugee from
			the "Q" continuum?
			For that matter could she be Q?
			Q would never bother with
			contracts.
			Or be interested in economic
			forecasts...
			Yes, I noticed that too,
			Counselor... I had the distinct
			feeling we were in the presence
			of a flim-flam artist...
			But her powers...
			Her powers are at best unclear.
			Think about it, Worf...
			Transporter technology can make
			things appear and disappear...
			the illusion of turning into a
			Klingon creature could be
			accomplished by a holographic
			projection...
			And creating a minor tremor could
			be the result of a low-frequency
			tractor beam projected against the
			tectonic plates.
			We're capable of recreating any
			of these events but she dresses
			them up and delivers them with
			a dramatic flair...
			Like a magician.
			Exactly.
			She has an incredibly focused
			mind... it was virtually
			impossible to sense any
			deception... or anything else for
			that matter...
			The best magicians won't ever let
			you see what's up their sleeve,
			Counselor...
			There must be a power source she's
			tapping into to produce all these
			effects... she's not hiding that
			up her sleeve...
			Number One, you and Worf will run
			high-resolution scans of this
			star system. Look for a ship or
			a base of operations -- anything
			large enough to generate that
			power... Mister La Forge,
			accompany Doctor Clark back to
			the science station... see if
			you can trace the origin of the
			tremors...
			Security to Bridge. Intruder on
			board.
			Your chair offers a lovely view
			of my planet, Picard... come sit
			with me...
			Madame, you will either leave my
			Bridge or I will remove you by
			force...
			By force... ? I'm disappointed.
			You didn't strike me as that sort,
			Picard... But by all means,
			try.
			Mister Worf...
			I was really hoping you'd try
			it yourself.
			Transporter Room Three, lock on
			to the intruder and transport her
			to the planet surface...
			Aye, sir...
			Ensign, I want shields up until
			further notice.
			Yessir, Captain. Whatever you
			say.
			We're not impressed by your magic
			tricks.
			I pity you. We live in a universe
			of magic, which evidently you
			cannot see.
			Ah, my pale friend has returned...
			have you finished examining the
			contract?
			I have, sir.
			Report, Data.
			The contract does agree to deliver
			the people of Ventax Two into the
			personal servitude of Ardra at
			the end of one thousand years
			of peace. I have compared the
			terms to the body of laws which
			govern the planet. The language
			of the agreement is correct in
			every detail.
			Such speed and accuracy. You're
			much too talented to be human...
			I am an android.
			Android. Of course. How
			wonderful. An unexpected bonus.
			Bonus?
			When the contract came to term,
			I gained clear title to the
			planet, anything on the surface,
			in the air or in orbit. You see,
			the Enterprise belongs to me now
			as well.
			I'm afraid one could interpret
			the contract that way, sir.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			claim this woman, who calls
			herself Ardra, has made upon my
			ship is clearly an empty threat.
			But she has further inspired my
			determination to expose her for
			the fraud she is.
			Come.
			You asked to see me, sir?
			Mister Data... A wise man once
			said there's a sucker born every
			minute.
			Barnum, P.T., sir.
			I have been examining the dynamics
			of what used to be called the
			confidence game... it is really
			quite fascinating and worthy of
			your study...
			Do you believe Ardra is, to use
			the vernacular, a "con artist",
			sir... ?
			I do, Mister Data... and our job
			is to find a way to out con the
			con artist...
			Sir, if I may point out, the
			Ventaxians did have a thousand
			years of peace and tranquility...
			as Ardra promised...
			We can only speculate about what
			occurred on this planet a thousand
			years ago, Data... Maybe a
			Ventaxian leader saw the
			destruction of his society at hand
			and conceived this Contract of
			Ardra to motivate change. Or
			maybe there really was an Ardra
			of some sort who was the basis
			of this myth.
			Who knows? The point is --
			somehow a fundamental theology was
			created that transformed this
			society.
			But along with all the benefits
			of change, came a latent fear that
			has been passed down through
			generations...
			A fear that someday Ardra would
			return for remuneration.
			And now we are asked to believe
			she has.
			As you may recollect from your
			performance as Ebenezer Scrooge,
			Data, "fear" can be a powerful
			motivator.
			Indeed, Captain, in the story,
			the spirits used fear to motivate
			Scrooge to reform his character.
			In the hands of a con artist, fear
			can be used to motivate obedience,
			capitulation... to exploit
			innocent people. That is what
			I believe is happening here.
			Is there no possibility at all
			she is the same Ardra who was here
			a millenium ago?
			I appreciate the fact that we have
			encountered species that live that
			long... so I will admit the
			possibility. But I do not believe
			this woman is the devil or had
			the powers to create harmony on
			this world. These people made
			massive changes that improved
			their quality of life... they did
			this on their own. And I intend
			to prove it. But I need a
			loophole... something I can use
			to challenge the validity of the
			contract...
			The language seems carefully
			chosen to avoid any loopholes,
			sir...
			Check it again... and check every
			Ventaxian legal precedent for
			the last thousand years...
			We'll talk first thing in the
			morning.
			Sir, I feel I should point out
			one possibly incongruous aspect
			of your Scrooge analogy.
			What's that, Data?
			The spirits that frightened
			Scrooge turned out to be quite
			real...
			Bah. Humbug.
			Security to Captain's quarters...
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf!
			I've arranged for a bit of
			privacy... just the two of us.
			I'm growing tired of your games,
			madame...
			Oh, come now, Picard, you know
			you find me tantalizing... give
			in to your desires...
			I find nothing tantalizing in your
			garish display... on the contrary,
			I find it obvious and common...
			Easily fixed.
			I can be your ideal woman,
			Picard... prim and proper and
			chaste... until I succumb to your
			charms... Or would your fantasies
			turn more toward a professional
			woman, perhaps one in a Starfleet
			uniform... perhaps I could even
			be...
			... someone close at hand and yet
			unattainable... I can do anything
			for you, Captain. Anything you
			could ever imagine.
			You shallow, pathetic woman.
			I could give you a night that
			would light fire in your dreams
			until you die... and you would
			reject me?
			Easily.
			You shall regret it.
			I think not.
			Oh, you will...
			Captain, we weren't expecting you
			here.
			Neither was I.
			La Forge to Enterprise.
			Go ahead.
			Worf, the Captain's here... You
			better beam him back on board...
			The Captain! But I have no...
			It's all right Worf. Ardra
			somehow transported me down here.
			Beam me directly to my quarters.
			We've locked on to you.
			Transporters are malfunctioning,
			Captain... some sort of
			interference... checking...
			Just have Mister Data fetch me
			in a shuttle and have him bring
			along a uniform...
			Did you say a uniform?
			I did.
			Aye, sir...
			La Forge and Doctor Clark have
			made no headway... Worf and
			Commander Riker have not picked
			up anything on their scans...
			Sir, I have found one obscure
			precedent in Ventaxian law that
			might be of interest.
			Yes?
			It is noted as Akul K'Ton versus
			Garv Etes... dated Ventaxian year
			nine-three-one, A.A.... a dispute
			was registered in the township
			of Tau Velor...
			Summarize the pertinent points,
			Data...
			In effect, it was a contract
			dispute over services rendered
			by a Klingon craftsman on the
			construction of a Ventaxian home.
			Because the dispute involved an
			alien culture, the parties decided
			that arbitration rather than the
			courts would resolve the issue.
			Both sides were required to agree
			on an arbiter and the case was
			decided in favor of the Ventaxian.
			It is the only known case
			involving an alien claimant.
			That's exactly what I needed...
			good work, Data...
			But, sir, why would Ardra agree
			to an arbitration in this
			matter...
			I intend to play a confidence game
			of my own on our new landlord...
			How, sir?
			The same way any confidence game
			is run... by making her believe
			she is getting something for
			nothing...
			Shuttle One to Enterprise...
			prepare for docking sequence...
			Proceed, Shuttle One.
			Enterprise. Enterprise. Do you
			read me? Enterprise, come in.
			I cannot locate the Enterprise
			anywhere within one lightyear of
			the planet.
			I don't believe Ardra is capable
			of transporting the Enterprise
			a lightyear away. Continue
			hailing them, Mister Data...
			repeat on all frequencies...
			Hey, I think we've found
			something.
			A sudden jump in Z particle
			readings, right around the time
			the Enterprise disappeared.
			Where did it originate?
			It was too brief to pinpoint.
			But it could suggest a hidden
			power source...
			Gentlemen, I need to find that
			source in order to defeat this
			woman...
			Well, if you can get her to
			perform a few more magic tricks
			like that one we might be able
			to track it down...
			So, I trust you have a bit more
			respect for me now.
			What have you done with my ship,
			Ardra?
			I've done nothing with your ship.
			My ship is safely in my
			possession.
			I do not recognize your claim on
			the Enterprise or on this world
			for that matter... and in
			accordance with Ventaxian legal
			precedent I call for an
			arbitration...
			An arbitration? There is nothing
			to arbitrate here...
			But there is, madame, for you are
			a fraud and I intend to prove you
			could not have affected the
			changes that took place on this
			planet...
			Do you not believe what you see
			with your own eyes... your ship
			is gone...
			An illusion. Magicians have been
			making all sorts of things
			disappear for ages.
			You underestimate me... but then
			most people do... until it's too
			late.
			If you are who you say you are,
			you have nothing to lose in an
			arbitration.
			I also have nothing to gain. I
			already have possession of this
			planet and your ship...
			I am prepared to offer you a
			further incentive... if you win,
			I will take you to the ruins of
			Ligillium...
			The Zaterl Emerald? You know
			where it is?
			I do.
			You're clever.
			But I have enough jewels.
			If you wish this foolish
			arbitration, I will choose my own
			prize...
			And what would that be?
			You.
			By all rights, your body is
			already mine... but I want more...
			I want your heart, your mind, your
			soul... And I want you to give
			them to me without resistance,
			of your own free will.
			So, do you still wish to pursue
			this most dangerous game?
			I agree to your terms.
			Picard, I will enjoy you morning
			noon and night.
			We must agree on an arbiter.
			Very well. I choose Mister Data.
			Any objections?
			Mister Data? He is a member of
			my crew.
			Of my crew. And he's an android.
			He is incapable of deceit or bias.
			He has no feelings to get in the
			way of his judgment.
			Ardra, before he responds, may
			I have a word in private with
			Captain Picard?
			Sir, I request that you reject
			me as arbiter.
			Why?
			Ardra is right. If I am chosen,
			I will perform my duties without
			bias or sentiment. I cannot
			guarantee that I will deliver a
			verdict in your favor.
			Data, where else on this planet
			will I find someone that she
			cannot intimidate. You are
			incapable of fear... in this play,
			you are the perfect choice for
			the role.
			Sir, I will have to precisely
			follow the rules of conduct for
			a ventaxian jurist.
			I understand. You'll make a fine
			judge.
			I accept Data as arbiter.
			Then let the hearing begin.
			Could you describe the state of
			your planet when I first visited
			a thousand years ago?
			Objection. The witness has no
			personal knowledge.
			Overruled. He is qualified to
			present an historical view.
			Answer the question.
			A thousand years ago our planet
			was dying. Overcrowded and
			dangerous city-states warred
			unceasingly with each other. The
			air and water were polluted with
			industrial waste. There was a
			constant threat of starvation and
			epidemic.
			And then what happened?
			And then you came.
			Objection. There is no conclusive
			evidence that this woman visited
			the planet a thousand years ago...
			I suppose you want a thousand year
			old witness?
			That would be quite acceptable.
			Jared. In the contract, does it
			specify how you would know me when
			I return?
			Yes... by the date...
			Anything else... ?
			... by the shaking of the cities...
			and by the visions...
			And all of these occurred on
			schedule.
			Yes.
			Your honor, I submit I have
			established my identity as stated
			by the contract.
			Captain Picard, my interpretation
			of Ventaxian law suggests under
			these circumstances, this is
			acceptable... your objection is
			overruled.
			But your honor... !
			Sir, I have ruled. Sit down.
			You may proceed.
			Thank-you, your honor.
			When I first set foot on Ventax
			Two, what did I offer your people?
			According to the scrolls, you
			offered to give us a thousand
			years of peace and prosperity,
			if we would promise to surrender
			ourselves to you at the end of
			the term.
			Now why do you think they would
			strike such a bargain...
			I must object! The answer would
			be pure speculation.
			The question is phrased correctly.
			Please answer.
			We had nothing to lose. There
			was no hope in sight.
			Until I came along.
			Objection!
			I withdraw the observation. No
			further questions.
			Your honor, nothing in this
			testimony proves that Ardra
			herself had any power to affect
			the lives of the Ventaxians.
			My opponent has failed to prove
			her case and I therefore move
			that her claim be summarily
			dismissed.
			I find no cause to invalidate the
			contract at this time. The
			arbitration will continue.
			Your honor, Captain Picard as a
			new visitor to my planet has been
			a consistent doubter of my
			abilities... I'd like to ask him
			a few questions if I may...
			It is highly irregular to question
			the opposing advocate but I see
			no reason to deny it. Proceed...
			Please don't take any offense at
			these questions, you know how fond
			I am of you...
			Objection.
			Sustained. The advocate will
			refrain from expressing personal
			affections for her opponent.
			You don't believe my powers are
			real, do you.
			No, I don't.
			Then, sir, may I ask you to
			explain... this...
			You are out of order...
			Or this?
			The advocate will refrain from
			making her opponent disappear.
			Or this?
			Can you explain it, Picard?
			Any further disruption and I will
			rule you in contempt of court.
			Is that understood?
			I'm sorry, your honor.
			Yes or no, can you explain any
			of this?
			No.
			I rest my case, your honor.
			The decay rate of these Z
			particles makes it almost
			impossible to trace the source...
			I'm correlating particle
			trajectories... they're starting
			to align... wait a minute...
			I have coordinates... thirty-four
			degrees north, sixty-two degrees
			east, at an altitude of two
			hundred ten kilometers.
			That would put it in orbit...
			... above the western magnetic
			pole... running visual scan...
			Nothing.
			Uh uh... this time, I don't buy
			the magic... something's gotta
			be there...
			Let's run a wavelength stretchout
			and bring it down into the
			ultraviolet... check intervals
			of half an angstrom...
			Jared, you have described quite
			thoroughly the history of your
			people before and after Ardra's
			first visit. But I am a little
			unclear on the change itself.
			Did Ardra simply snap her fingers,
			transforming Ventax Two into
			paradise?
			Objection. Picard is mocking me.
			Overruled. The opposing
			advocate's job is to mock your
			argument.
			Please answer the question.
			The changes occurred gradually,
			over a long period of time.
			Did she personally form the
			government that has peacefully
			ruled Ventax Two for a millennium?
			No, historical records indicate
			a council was convened to assess
			our options. They drew up a new
			constitution which the population
			later ratified.
			I see. So Ardra advised this
			council...
			No.
			Well, then she must have destroyed
			all weapons on the planet...
			No, our leaders did that. And
			they signed a treaty of
			non-aggression.
			Which Ardra wrote, I assume.
			There is no indication she had
			anything at all to do with the
			treaty.
			Well then, let's move on to the
			environmental gains made on Ventax
			Two. How were those
			accomplished...
			We shifted our economy from an
			industrial to an agrarian
			base... it was more ecologically
			sound.
			But Ardra must have at least
			purified the polluted water and
			air...
			No, the record shows there were
			a series of initiatives covering
			everything from atmospheric
			contaminants to waste disposal.
			Did Ardra pick up even one piece
			of trash?
			Objection!
			To what?
			To the tone of voice.
			Overruled.
			Ardra had left Ventax Two before
			the environmental reforms began.
			Excuse me, but it sounds as though
			with a great deal of hard work
			and courage, your ancestors
			changed this world all by
			themselves.
			Objection. The advocate is
			drawing conclusions.
			Sustained.
			I will draw my own conclusions,
			if you do not mind.
			No further questions.
			Rebuttal?
			Just two questions. Is there any
			doubt in your mind, any doubt at
			all, that if I had not intervened,
			the terrible conditions here would
			have continued?
			I remind you that you're under
			oath.
			No doubt at all.
			Then, as "former" head of state
			for the Ventaxian people, you are
			satisfied that I fulfilled my part
			of the bargain.
			Yes, Ardra.
			Thank-you. Your honor, what more
			can be said. Both sides agree
			the terms of the contract have
			been fulfilled.
			Captain Picard, do you have any
			further evidence to present before
			I render judgment?
			I believe my associate, Mister
			La Forge is bringing me that very
			information... If I may have a
			recess...
			Hi, Data.
			Hi, Geordi. A one hour recess
			is granted.
			Mister La Forge, my reputation
			as a litigator, not to mention
			my soul, is in serious jeopardy...
			Well, whatever's been going on
			over here gave us exactly what
			we needed...
			You've identified her source of
			power... ?
			It's a cloaked ship...
			She has a Romulan cloaking device?
			More likely, a bad copy of one.
			We picked it up through a
			wavelength stretchout...
			And the Enterprise?
			Exactly where it's supposed to
			be. Ardra extended her cloaking
			shields around it... set up a
			subspace damping field to
			interfere with normal operations.
			I've isolated the frequency spread
			and penetrated the field.
			Can you make contact?
			Already have...
			Good... here's what I want to
			do... but we have less than an
			hour...
			Jared, you are a wise and
			experienced leader, I would guess
			you trust your senses...
			Yes... I would say so...
			And all your senses tell you this
			woman here is the most powerful
			force on this planet, don't
			they...
			Yes...
			Jared, what would you say if I
			told you that Ardra has no powers
			whatsoever?
			But... we have seen her powers
			right here...
			That's right, and you will again.
			Ah yes, Ardra's magic. Jared,
			would you believe me if I told
			you that I could steal Ardra's
			powers and perform the same
			magical acts as she?
			I am sorry, Captain Picard, but
			you are not Ardra.
			That is true. I am not Ardra.
			And yet, I can create a tremor
			just as she did.
			Objection, your honor...
			I think he deserves some
			leeway... overruled... but we
			have seen enough, Captain.
			Agreed. Ardra, if you would do
			the honors and stop the tremors...
			Uh... of... of course...
			What's the matter?
			I like the tremors.
			Well, I don't.
			Recognize the old bag of tricks?
			How about this one?
			Come back if you can, Ardra.
			No... ? Fine, allow me...
			Of all the impudence.
			Impudence?
			Impudence is pretending to be
			Fek'lhr of Klingon...
			Captain, your leeway has run out.
			Your honor, I appreciate the
			court's indulgence... allow me
			to explain. A team from the
			Enterprise has taken control of
			this woman's ship in orbit around
			Ventax Two. Thank you for your
			help, Number One.
			Glad to be of service, sir.
			They have been monitoring me on
			my communicator... and executing
			a prearranged program on her
			ship's computer... a fairly
			ingenious combination of force
			field projection, holography, and
			transporter effects. Ardra
			controls her magic literally by
			the blink of an eye... centuries
			old technology -- an implant that
			allows her eye movements to choose
			and activate each illusion.
			She once told us she is known by
			many names. At least she was
			honest about that. Her crew has
			admitted that she has in fact
			used twenty-three aliases in this
			sector alone...
			You had no right...
			... deceiving innocent people in
			petty schemes for years.
			Ventax Two offered her the
			greatest opportunity of her
			nefarious career. She learned
			about the myth of Ardra, studied
			it... and expertly played on your
			fears until your people were ready
			to virtually surrender to her.
			Your Honor, under the
			circumstances, I believe it is
			only fair that I release the
			Ventaxians from their
			obligation... and I'll even let
			them keep the peace they have...
			and I'll just be on my way...
			With the advocate's withdrawal,
			the contract is hereby dissolved.
			This arbitration is adjourned.
			Thank you, Captain... you saved
			our lives...
			No, Jared... as I've tried to tell
			you, you saved your own lives a
			long time ago...
			Congratulations, sir.
			Your honor.
			You would have had more fun if
			you lost.
			Until we meet again, Jean-Luc
			Picard of the Starship
			Enterprise.
