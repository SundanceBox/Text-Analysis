			Captain's log, Stardate 44143.7.
			Due to a medical emergency, we
			have been forced to cut short a
			two-day liberty on Ogus Two and
			set course for Starbase
			Four-One-Six.
			It seems a young man's practical
			joke has come dangerously close
			to a lethal conclusion.
			Well Mister Potts, why don't we
			start at the beginning?
			It was a joke, sir. I just meant
			to scare him.
			From the beginning, please.
			We were at the arcade, sir. I
			brought this balloon with me,
			filled with red pillion dye. You
			see, Willie is always making fun
			of me. I figured I'd get him
			back. I only meant to scare him.
			Slow down, Jake.
			We programmed the game for an
			ordinary laser duel. You know,
			twenty-one points. Four points
			for a...
			I'm familiar with the game. Go
			on.
			We went out to the forest behind
			the east arcade. I told Willie
			that his laser pistol looked kind
			of funny, almost like a real one.
			When I went behind the trees, I
			put the balloon into my vest, and
			then...
			So you made your nine year-old
			brother think he killed you?
			Yes, sir.
			And then he ran away.
			Yes, sir.
			And while he was hiding he ate
			the fruit of a cove palm.
			It was just a joke. I didn't...
			I assume you are aware of the
			infectious nature of the parasites
			which inhabit cove palms?
			I am now, sir.
			Are you familiar with the
			condition upon which I agreed to
			allow you two boys to remain on
			the Enterprise when your parents
			went on sabbatical?
			That we'd stay out of trouble,
			sir.
			Mister Data.
			Think about it Mister Potts. And
			while you're at it, think about
			what might have happened had we
			not been this close to a starbase
			medical facility.
			Have you contacted the boy's
			parents?
			They are fully aware of the
			situation, sir.
			Good, escort this young man to
			the quarantine anteroom. Perhaps
			he'll be helpful in lifting his
			brother's spirits.
			Yes, sir.
			Please don't think that you have
			heard the last of this, Mister
			Potts.
			No, sir. I mean yes, sir.
			He's very frightened.
			As well he should be. I've never
			been a proponent of practical
			jokes. More often than not, they
			have unfortunate results.
			I wouldn't be surprised if this
			was his last practical joke for
			a long while.
			I'm more concerned with his
			brother's future at the moment,
			Counselor.
			Our Sickbay does have the facility
			to isolate parasitic proto-viruses
			but not in a favorable time frame
			for your brother.
			He really could die.
			Fortunately we are only two days
			from Starbase Four-One-Six, and
			their laboratory can...
			Can what sir?
			Their laboratory can do what,
			Commander?
			Sir, I know I made a mistake...
			I can tell you're angry... but
			if you're not going to talk to
			me...
			Back so soon, Mister Data?
			La Forge to bridge.
			Go ahead, Commander.
			We've completed our dilithium
			vector calibrations, sir. You're
			clear to increase to warp seven.
			Very good, Geordi. Let me know
			if you...
			Captain, did you request a course
			correction?
			Sir, I didn't say we could
			increase speed to warp nine-point-
			one.
			New course set for heading
			three-four-one mark two-two-one.
			Course set by whom?
			Not me, Commander.
			What's going on?
			Data, who programmed the new
			coordinates?
			Warp nine-point-three, sir.
			I don't advise this, Captain.
			If we're going to maintain the
			realignment progression we
			shouldn't be pushing more than
			warp eight for at least an hour.
			Commander...
			Evacuate bridge. Deck one life
			support failure in fifteen
			seconds.
			Turbolifts Three and Four,
			gentlemen.
			Geordi, transfer helm to
			Engineering.
			Aye, sir.
			Evacuate bridge. Deck one life
			support failure in ten seconds.
			Reassemble in Engineering.
			La Forge, let's get a diagnostic
			sweep underway...
			Evacuate bridge. Deck one life
			support failure in five seconds.
			Deck one life support has been
			terminated.
			Our velocity is holding steady
			at warp nine-point-three. Do you
			wish to override, Commander?
			Not yet. Computer, isolate cause
			of life support failure.
			Atmosphere conditioning pumps on
			Deck one are operating in
			negative mode.
			How could that be? There are
			seven independent safety
			interlocks to prevent that.
			Sir, I think we've found the
			problem, but it doesn't really
			make sense.
			It seems we have more than one
			problem. Bring the Enterprise
			to a full stop, Commander.
			Full stop, Ensign Kopf.
			It's not responding, sir.
			I ordered all helm control
			transferred down here, damn it!
			We did sir. We've been waiting
			for your instructions.
			I'm going to have to do this at
			the manual input level, sir.
			Wes...
			We're still on the altered
			heading, Captain, holding at warp
			nine point three.
			Force fields have been established
			on all Main Bridge turbolift doors
			and service crawlways, sir.
			Computer, locate Lieutenant
			Commander Data.
			Commander Data is on the Main
			Bridge.
			What the hell is he up to?
			Number One, take a security team
			up to Deck Two. See if you can
			break through from below.
			Everything's locked up, Captain.
			No control of impulse or warp
			engines down here.
			Navigation doesn't respond either,
			sir.
			Picard to bridge. Commander Data
			do you hear me?
			I repeat.   Data, do you
			hear...
			Computer. Recognize Data,
			Lieutenant Commander. Alpha One
			clearance.
			Priority clearance recognition
			Alpha One.
			Maintain minimum auxiliary power
			and disengage subspace
			communications.
			Acknowledged.
			He is on the Bridge, sir.
			Commander La Forge, prepare for
			saucer separation.
			Sir, we're at Warp nine-three!
			I'm aware of the risks, Ensign.
			When the umbilical splits, we
			should regain primary control...
			do you agree?
			Yes, sir.
			. Be
			prepared to sweep back and pull
			it in with a tractor beam.
			Aye, sir.
			Initiate auto sequence.
			Computer, recognize Picard, Jean-
			Luc. Alpha Two clearance.
			Priority clearance recognition,
			Alpha Two.
			Cancel separation sequence.
			Sequence cancelled.
			Isolate all remaining command
			functions and accept related
			orders and inquiries from Main
			Bridge only.
			The separation sequence has been
			aborted, Captain.
			Computer, recognize Jean-Luc
			Picard Alpha Two priority and
			re-establish separation procedures
			immediately.
			Orders regarding command functions
			are no longer accepted from your
			present location.
			And just what location are they
			accepted from?
			Interface terminals on Main Bridge
			only.
			You're the only one who has
			clearance to localize command
			functions, sir.
			It seems Mister Data has acquired
			them, as well.
			The isolinear subprocessor extends
			three-point-five meters.
			I've got a clear path to panel
			J14-Baker. What's that going to
			do for us?
			J14-Baker backs onto Science
			Station Two, Commander.
			Have they reinverted the
			environmental control sequencer?
			Yes, sir. Life support has been
			re-established.
			Then, you and Casey get up here.
			Let's get to it.
			Computer. Configure a perimeter
			field charge, sections Nine-K
			through Twelve-T.
			What the hell was that?
			He's activated a force field, sir.
			Great! Just great!!
			Chief O'Brien.
			Yes, Captain.
			You had better disable the site-
			to-site transport function. When
			we get to wherever we're going,
			I don't want him beaming off the
			bridge.
			I'll get right to it, sir.
			Doctor Crusher.
			Yes, Captain.
			Is your quarantine intact, Doctor?
			Sickbay force fields don't seem
			to have been affected.
			The boy?
			He's alright. But he's not going
			to stay alright. Sir, we need
			to get this ship to a starbase
			medical facility...
			It seems, Doctor, that Mister Data
			has other plans for the Enterprise
			right now.
			C'mon, I can't believe that!
			Everybody's played a practical
			joke at one time or another.
			Not me.
			Not even a little one? How about
			April Fools'? Are you telling me
			you've never tried to pull
			something on April Fools' Day?
			What for? It's never funny to
			the one getting fooled.
			Well, I'm sure your brother didn't
			intend this to get out of hand.
			Certainly not to the degree it
			has. Take a deep breath.
			What's so funny about making
			someone think you killed them?
			A deep breath.
			Have you been drinking all the
			water I asked you to?
			Yes.
			Well, keep it up. We may have
			a short delay in reaching the
			starbase and I want you...
			There! You see? How can I tell
			him if he's not going to listen
			to me?
			Why don't you try, Jake?
			It's just a waste of time. He
			won't listen.
			Computer, prepare to transport
			me directly to the following
			coordinates.
			Site-to-site transport interlocks
			have been manually deactivated.
			Can you override?
			Negative.
			Show me the shortest route to
			Transporter Room One.
			Computer, prepare to activate a
			cascade force field sequence in
			the following progression.
			No matter what we try, the
			computer will only acknowledge
			commands from the bridge, sir.
			He's blocked every subspace
			channel, Captain. We can't even
			call for help.
			Have you tried tracing back
			navigation inputs?
			We don't even know what star
			system we're in, sir.
			The only way we knew we'd come
			out of warp was by looking out
			a window.
			O'Brien to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead, Chief.
			Captain, he's up to something.
			What now?
			He discovered the site-to-site
			lockout. I wouldn't be surprised
			if he tries to make it to a
			transporter room now.
			How much further can you safely
			disable the ransporters, Mister
			O'Brien?
			I'm afraid I've done all I can,
			sir. As soon as he realized we
			had knocked out the primary power
			bus he put up force fields around
			the secondaries. I don't
			recommend anyone going near those
			circuits now.
			I want security teams along the
			main passageways and in every
			transporter oom, Lieutenant.
			See if the computer would be good
			enough to give you the specific
			stun setting to disable Mister
			Data.
			Computer, estimate time from this
			location to Starbase Four-One-Six
			at warp nine.
			Inquiries regarding command
			functions are no longer accepted
			from your present location.
			Computer, establish a security
			code for access to all functions
			previously transferred to Bridge.
			Enter code.
			Four, one, three, three, six,
			eight, Tango, one, eight, one,
			one, seven, one, Charlie, four,
			Victor, three... eight, eight,
			eight, zero, Foxtrot, six, one,
			five, three, three, five, nine,
			five, seven, lock.
			Security code intact for all
			specified inquiries and orders.
			Computer, initiate cascade
			sequence, accepting instructions
			from Commander Data en route, now.
			He's out. Security team
			approaching location.
			Intersection Eight-J. Aft-port.
			Establish.
			I order you to stop.
			Computer, begin scan-phase.
			No, it's too close.
			This has gone far enough, Data.
			Computer, three-meter cross-seal.
			I wouldn't advise that, sir. The
			phase coils don't take well to
			ricochets.
			What's he doing?
			He's reactivating the site-to-site
			transport interlocks.
			Does that mean he'll be able to...
			Great!
			The force field only seems to go
			across the front of the pad, sir.
			Security should be able to cut
			through from behind.
			Great!
			You're right on time.
			Open.
			One of these...
			And one of these...
			And...
			There we are.
			I fail to recall how I arrived
			here.
			I sent for you... In a manner
			of speaking.
			Data to Enterprise.
			Enterprise, do you read me?
			I always loved that face. Please
			sit down.
			We were headed for a medical
			facility. I was taking the boy's
			brother to Sickbay and...
			I'm sure your starship will be
			back for you soon. Please, sit.
			I must find a way to contact the
			Enterprise.
			Tell me, do I look somewhat
			familiar to you?
			You do bear a resemblance to
			Doctor Noonian Soong, the
			cyberneticist who constructed me.
			But, Doctor Soong was killed
			shortly afterward by the
			Crystalline Entity.
			It's your lucky day, Data. You've
			found your long lost father, and
			he's alive. What do you think
			of that?
			But the colony was destroyed,
			there were no survivors.
			I've never felt too comfortable
			living anywhere without a prearranged
			route of escape. I
			admit, I wouldn't have guessed
			I'd be running from a giant
			snowflake, but...
			It is really you.
			Indulge an old man and stand on
			one leg for me.
			Please.
			Excellent! You know before I
			activated your positronic net,
			I had the damnedest time working
			out those fluidic equilibrium
			circuits.
			Perhaps you could help me contact
			my ship.
			If you can't raise them with
			your...
			communicator, what can I do?
			It's alright. You can put it
			down.
			They'll be back for you. I'm
			certain. Trust me.
			Now, tell me. How are you at
			differentiating between a humid
			day and a dry one?
			The moisture content of the ship's
			atmosphere is maintained at a
			moderate thirty-seven percent.
			No, No. Not your ship. When
			you're on land, a planet.
			I can differentiate between
			varying hygrometric levels.
			Without some sort of external
			sensor?
			Yes, sir.
			What then? What's the difference?
			Between humid and dry?
			Humid air feels different against
			my skin, sir. And it carries
			smells differently. I assume this
			is due to the fact that
			moisture...
			How wonderful. I tried so hard
			to get that right. It's very
			important you know.
			May I ask why you have brought
			me here?
			I incorporated an encoded homing
			circuit into your sublogic
			controller.
			Your response refers to how you
			brought me here, not why.
			Haven't you missed me, Data?
			I suppose that's impossible.
			I assumed you dead, sir.
			Well, my longevity isn't the only
			surprise I have in store for you,
			Data.
			The quarantine field in Sickbay,
			sir.
			You have access to it?
			When he transferred force field
			control to the Bridge he must have
			only specified fields he was
			planning to initiate. The
			quarantine field was already
			operating.
			Under normal circumstances, we
			could divert that field energy and
			use it to cancel the force field
			protecting the bridge... But we
			have to retain the medical
			quarantine.
			Determine the absolute minimum
			field energy that Doctor Crusher
			needs... and use the rest to get
			me onto my bridge.
			How are you feeling this morning?
			Not so great. I'm having trouble
			standing up. I get sorta dizzy.
			You know the old story about the
			man who tells his doctor, "It
			hurts when I raise my arm like
			this?"
			The doctor says, "Then don't raise
			your arm like that."
			So, if I get dizzy standing up...
			Don't stand up.
			Okay Doc, we're ready. If all
			goes well you shouldn't notice
			a thing.
			Make sure all goes well,
			Commander.
			Your brother says you still won't
			speak to him.
			So?
			This is very hard on him, too.
			He feels very guilty about what
			happened. He's your brother.
			Why is everybody so worried about
			him? I'm the one who's sick...
			I'm the one who's gonna die.
			Nobody's going to die, Willie.
			Do you hear me? Nobody!
			Captain, we are in.
			We're on our way, Lieutenant.
			Computer, restore Tactical
			Station.
			Deactivation of command function
			overrides requires Alpha Two
			clearance.
			Beverly thinks its going to be
			tight. Let's hope he didn't take
			us too far off course.
			Let's hope.
			It won't answer to my clearance,
			sir.
			Computer, this is Captain Picard.
			Return all command functions to
			stations.
			Alpha Two clearance recognized.
			Please enter security code.
			Security code!?
			I was afraid of something like
			that.
			Sensors are operative.
			Well at least that's something.
			What have you got?
			No fix on Data. But I am picking
			up a single lifeform on the
			surface, sir. It appears human.
			That's one human who's got the
			answers to a lot of questions.
			Something else, sir.
			What is it?
			A small vessel... entering orbit.
			I detect no lifeforms aboard.
			Good. Good. Keep it up. Ah
			huh...
			Old Tom Handy swore you'd never
			master that. Whistle!
			Ah, well. Enough Data, sit.
			I've been able to keep track of
			you from time to time. You've
			become somewhat of a celebrity
			in cybernetic circles.
			Why Starfleet?
			Sir?
			I gave you the ability to choose
			whatever you wanted... to do
			whatever you wanted. Why
			Starfleet?
			It was Starfleet officers who
			rescued me.
			Ah. So you decided to emulate
			your emancipators. How
			disappointing.
			What choice of vocation would have
			met with your approval?
			I often hoped you might become
			a scientist... perhaps a
			cyberneticist.
			To follow in your footsteps, as
			it were?
			I see -- nothing wrong with that.
			May I ask you a question, sir?
			Certainly. Anything you'd like.
			Why did you create me?
			Why does a painter paint? Why
			does a boxer box? You know what
			Michelangelo used to say? The
			sculptures he made were already
			there before he started, hidden
			in the marble. All he had to do
			was remove the unneeded bits.
			It wasn't quite that easy with
			you Data. But the need to do it,
			my need to do it, was no different
			than Michelangelo's need.
			Now, let me ask you a question.
			Why are humans so fascinated with
			old things?
			Old things?
			Old buildings, churches, walls,
			ancient things, antique
			things... tables, clocks, knick
			knacks... Why?
			There are many possible
			explanations.
			If you brought a Noophian to Earth
			he'd look around and say, "Tear
			that old village down. It's
			hanging in rags.
			Build me something new, something
			efficient." But to a human, that
			ancient wall, that old house, is
			a shrine, something to cherish....
			Again I ask you, why?
			Perhaps, for humans, old things
			represent a tie to the past.
			And what's so important about the
			past? People needed money, they
			got sick. Why tie yourself to
			that?
			Humans are mortal. They seem to
			need a sense of continuity.
			Ah hah!! Why?
			To give their lives meaning...
			A sense of purpose.
			And does this continuity only run
			one way, back into the past?
			I suppose it is a factor in the
			human desire to procreate.
			So you believe that having
			children gives humans a sense of
			immortality, do you?
			It is a reasonable explanation
			to your query, sir.
			And perhaps to yours, as well,
			Data.
			It appears we have a visitor.
			Lore!!
			Well, well, it seems we've got
			ourselves a family reunion.
			Doctor, I implore you, please do
			not reactivate him.
			Don't be ridiculous, Data.
			Open.
			Lore is far from the maniacal
			android you have made him out to
			be. In any case, he'll obey me.
			He always did.
			But he admitted to an alliance
			with the Crystal Entity. To gain
			its favor he betrayed the
			colonists and would have betrayed
			the Enterprise as well had I
			not...
			Hold still...
			There. One more.
			I'm well aware of Lore's
			shortcomings. Remember, it was
			I who deactivated him.
			And, as I have explained, it was
			I who was responsible for his
			reactivation. But it serves no
			purpose to make the same mistake
			twice.
			In science, Data, making the same
			mistake twice is often not a
			mistake at all. Quite the
			contrary.
			That should do it.
			So, you're still alive. I'm
			surprised you woke me. Why didn't
			you just take me apart and be done
			with it? That is why the two of
			you captured me?
			Data had nothing to do with this,
			Lore. And no one captured
			you... not exactly, that is. You
			see, both of your brains contain
			a simple homing device. Data's
			was activated purposefully.
			Yours... well until you walked
			in that door I didn't know you
			had ever been reassembled.
			No thanks to you.
			But thanks to you, dear brother,
			I spent nearly two years drifting
			in space. If it hadn't been for
			a fortunate encounter with a
			Pakled trade ship, I'd still be
			out there.
			I had no alternative. You would
			have destroyed the Enterprise.
			Well, since I appear to be an
			uninvited guest at your little
			party, I'll leave you with your
			beloved son and be on my way.
			No, wait. Stay here... There
			are questions I can answer.
			You'll have no chance to ask them
			later.
			You see, I'm dying.
			Dying from what, sir?
			Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
			What do you mean you're dying?
			You look fine. You're not that
			old. You look fine. What is
			this? Some kind of trick to see
			how we'd react?
			I wish it were.
			Dying from what, sir?
			We have control of sensors, life
			support and auxiliary power,
			Captain. Nothing more.
			The code, Mister La Forge?
			We can't even locate the file
			address. At least that would tell
			us how many digits we're talking
			about. Not that it would really
			help.
			I want something that will really
			help.
			And quickly. Willie Potts has
			twenty-four hours, thirty-six
			tops. If it goes longer than
			that, the only thing Starbase
			Four-One-Six will have left to
			do is a postmortem.
			Geordi, if the computer's
			programmed to allow Data to
			transport down, it would figure
			that it would allow him to beam
			back up. Right?
			It would figure.
			And Data left a trace imprint when
			he beamed down?
			Everyone does.
			So what would be involved in
			pulling that trace and finding
			a way to make the computer think
			someone else is Data? Maybe a
			few someone elses?
			We'd have to access the transport
			controller and reset it to a
			testing mode; convince it that
			it's back in school accepting
			simulated inputs. It's going to
			be tough without the main
			computer, but we could network
			a few tricorders together.
			Try, Mister La Forge.
			Yes, sir.
			You did what you had to do? What
			kind of answer is that?
			The only one I can give you. You
			were not...
			... "functioning" properly.
			Lore told me the colonists became
			envious of him because you made
			him "so completely human."
			I wouldn't exactly have used the
			word "envious."
			You disassembled me. Took me
			apart... and so soon after you had
			put me together. You gave me no
			chance.
			Lore also said the colonists
			petitioned you to replace him with
			a "less perfect" android?
			The last thing you should think
			of yourself as Data is "less
			perfect." The two of you are
			virtually identical... except
			for a bit of programming.
			It was a lie. Another lie.
			I would have proven to you that
			I was worthy, if you had given
			me the chance. But it was easier
			to turn your back and build your
			precious Data.
			You were the first. You meant
			as much to me as Data ever did.
			But you were unstable. The
			colonists weren't envious of you,
			they were afraid of you. You were
			unstable.
			I am not less perfect than Lore.
			Why didn't you try to fix me?
			It was within your power to fix
			me!
			It wasn't as easy as that. The
			next logical step was to construct
			Data. Afterward, I planned to
			get back to you... to "fix" you.
			But I never got that chance.
			Next logical step?!
			I am not less perfect than Lore.
			Enough! Sit down, both of you.
			For all these years I've been
			plagued by what went wrong.
			With all the complexities you
			possessed, the nuances... basic
			emotion seemed almost simple in
			comparison. But the emotion
			turned, and twisted, and became
			entangled with ambition... Lore,
			if I had known you were no longer
			sitting in pieces on a distant
			shelf... If I had known I could
			push a button and bring you
			here... I would have spent those
			years trying to make things right
			for you as well. But all I knew
			of was Data.
			So I worked, long and hard, and
			now I believe I've succeeded.
			This is why I brought you here.
			Basic emotions, Data. Simple
			feelings. Your feelings.
			I've imagined how hard it's been
			for you... living amongst beings
			so moved by emotion.
			I don't have to imagine. I know
			how hard it's been. But, you'll
			be surprised Data... feelings
			do funny things. You may even
			learn to understand your "evil"
			brother... to forgive him. We
			will be more alike, you and I.
			You'll see. I'm happy for you.
			I question your sincerity, Lore.
			Perhaps with this you'll learn
			to be more trusting, Data. Your
			brother has had good reason to
			be bitter.
			But sir, Lore was responsible
			for...
			He wasn't given the chance you
			and I were given... to live.
			But now I'm sure he understands
			why I had to do what I did.
			If there was only time left, I
			could help you as well... what
			a shame.
			The procedure is quite simple,
			but I'll need to rest first, I'm
			tired.
			And after the procedure, what
			then?
			I assume Data will return to his
			ship, and you to yours.
			No. You'll need someone to care
			for you. I will remain.
			I need to rest now.
			May I assist you... with the
			procedure?
			It's a simple insertion... no need.
			They're sure this is going to
			work?
			Nobody knows the Transporters
			better than O'Brien and La Forge.
			They tell me they've managed more
			than a little sleight of hand with
			our authorization codes.
			And they can insert them into the
			recall loop?
			The computer should think all
			three of us are Data.
			Let's just hope we don't all beam
			back looking like Data.
			Whenever you say, sir.
			Bring him home, Number One.
			Energize.
			Data?
			The sons of the prophet
			Were valiant and bold
			And quite unaccustomed to fear
			But of all the most reckless
			Or so I am told
			Was Abdul Abulbul Amir.
			How do you feel?
			I've always loved that ditty.
			I could never quite get the
			cadence down before. Thanks,
			Father.
			You called me Father.
			Would you prefer I call you "Often-
			Wrong?"
			What did Lore tell you about that?
			Often-Wrong Soong! That is what
			the colonists called you, isn't
			it? A very sloppy rhyme...
			Wrong Soong. Wrong Soong. No,
			doesn't work. Let's see...
			Data, tell me how you're feeling.
			Often-Wrong's got a broken heart
			Can't even tell his boys apart.
			Lore!
			Well, well, you're not quite as
			feeble as I thought.
			This won't work. Those circuits,
			they weren't designed for you.
			Where's Data?
			"Where's Data?" You didn't fill
			Data with substandard parts! That
			honor was bestowed upon me,
			remember? You owe me, old man.
			Not him, me!
			You're not listening to me. It
			was not meant for you. It must
			be removed.
			Nice try, Often-Wrong.
			I'm not quite sure what it's
			doing. But its doing something.
			I didn't know you were alive.
			If I had...
			There were brave men a plenty
			All well known to fame
			Who served in the ranks of the Czar...
			The human is there.
			And Data?
			No way of knowing.
			On stun.
			Worf.
			It's all right, take it easy.
			It's Noonian Soong.
			That's impossible. Soong's dead.
			I think it's okay to move him.
			Look at this stuff. I'm telling
			you. It's Soong.
			I'm Commander William Riker of
			the Starship Enterprise.
			Here. Let me.
			Do you mind telling me what's
			going on, here?
			He surprised me. He rendered me
			unconscious. What happened?
			Who surprised you?
			So alike... I couldn't tell you
			apart...
			He's gone.... back to his ship,
			I think...
			There was only one chip...
			yours... I tried to tell him...
			Not enough time to build another.
			Who went back to his ship? Damn
			it, Data, what's going on?!
			Lore, sir. He was inadvertently
			summoned here by the same signal
			which activated my homing
			circuitry. It seems that after
			two years in interstellar space,
			he was...
			Mister Data. We've got a very
			sick boy on the Enterprise who's
			not getting any better. And we're
			dead in the water until you get
			us out of here.
			It's all right. Access your third
			nested memory file and execute
			instruction five-one-five-five.
			It will clear your memory block.
			I was unaware of the inconvenience
			I have caused, sir.
			We'll discuss it later.
			You're coming, too, Doctor. You
			need to get to Sickbay.
			No, no, no. I'll be fine.
			With all due respect, sir, you
			don't look fine to me.
			I've lived here a long time, young
			man. I have no plans of dying
			anywhere else.
			But sir, our medical facility
			could most likely...
			Go, Data. Go with your friends.
			May I say goodbye to Doctor Soong,
			sir?
			Alone, sir?
			Everybody dies, Data.
			Well, almost everybody.
			Do you believe... in some ways,
			we are alike?
			In many ways, I'd like to believe.
			Then it is alright for you to
			die... because I will remain alive.
			You know I cannot grieve for you.
			You will, in your own way.
			Goodbye Data.
			Goodbye.....Father.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44149.1.
			We have been at Starbase Four-One-Six
			for three days. Young Willie
			Potts is responding well to
			treatment and has been returned
			to the Enterprise.
			The transfer went well?
			He'll remain in quarantine for
			another week or two, but he's out
			of the woods.
			Yes, Captain. The boys appear
			to have reconciled their
			differences.
			They're brothers, Data. Brothers
			forgive.
