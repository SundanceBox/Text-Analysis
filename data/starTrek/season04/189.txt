			Ready... lift!
			He took a severe blow... possible
			trauma to the telencephalon...
			Start fifteen octares of
			quadroline. We'll need a complete
			del-scan series.
			I can't find his cardial organ...
			What do you mean? I'm reading
			a steady circulation...
			There it is... up here...
			In his digestive tract?
			Have you ever seen anything like
			this... ?
			He's missing three costal struts
			on one side and four on the other...
			You think that's something... look
			at this...
			He has digits on his terminus...
			What are you?
			What happened?
			You're in the crisis room at the
			Sikla Medical Facility. You've
			had a severe injury, but you're
			going to be all right.
			I was caught in the riot when the
			police moved in... that's the last
			thing I remember.
			Can you tell us your name?
			Rivas. Rivas Jakara.
			Rivas Jakara. Where do you live?
			In the Marta community on the
			southern continent...
			You're a long way from home.
			Are there any members of your
			family we should notify...
			No... I have no family.
			I can't stay here... I have to
			get back...
			You're in no condition to leave
			yet...
			There are several... unusual
			things about your case, Mister
			Jakara... your cranial lobes, for
			example. They seem to be surgical
			implants...
			I did have some cosmetic
			surgery... to correct a genetic
			birth defect...
			And these? Another birth defect?
			Yes, isn't that something? My
			father's were the same way...
			You want us to believe that all
			your abnormalities are inherited
			genetic traits?
			I understand your confusion. My
			personal physician is much more
			familiar with these... genetic
			irregularities... to be honest,
			I'd feel better if I were back
			home under her care...
			Why don't I talk to her about
			that... what's her name?
			Crusher... but actually, I'm not
			sure you'll be able to reach her.
			Why not?
			She's taking... a sabbatical.
			Well, we'll do the best we can
			for you.
			Oh, there was one other thing...
			We found this curious looking
			device in your clothes... what
			is it?
			Oh, it's just a toy I was taking
			home... a present...
			I thought you didn't have any
			family...
			For a neighbor's child.
			Did they find anything else, I
			had one piece of jewelry... a
			metal pin...
			No, I'm sorry. This was all we
			found...
			"Genetic irregularities"?... that
			thing isn't even the same species
			as we are...
			Keep your voice down.
			The last thing we need is a panic
			in here over some...
			It's all the space flights...
			they've attracted creatures from
			outer space...
			Now, that's exactly the kind of
			thing I don't want to hear ... is
			that understood?
			What are you going to do?
			With all the medical facilities
			available, why did he have to end
			up here?
			I think we ought to call Central
			Security.
			I'm not calling anybody yet. Not
			until we've done a lot more. A
			lot more. I want his story
			checked out...
			Run a complete search through the
			medical library... be absolutely
			certain there's never been
			anything like him...
			What if there're more of them?
			They could be everywhere...
			Somebody get Nilrem a calmative.
			We ought to see if we can find
			the physician Crusher. And give
			this thing...
			... to somebody in technical to
			check out.
			What about him?
			Cordon off this wing... I want
			security on his door twenty-nine
			hours a day... and I want this
			kept quiet...
			They've already questioned my
			judgement on the diagnostic
			center, criticized my resource
			allocations... all they need to
			hear now is that I'm treating
			alien creatures...
			At twelve-point-four after launch,
			the warp field generator will be
			activated...
			That's when it would break the
			light barrier?
			Yes, Chancellor. If we're
			successful, the craft will leave
			our star system in a matter of
			minutes and will be on its way
			toward the Garth system...
			And then what?
			And then, Krola, we'll see what's
			there...
			How long, Mirasta?
			We have the prototype design for
			the warp engine... it would simply
			be a matter of building the
			actual production units. If I
			get your approval today... ten
			months, maybe less.
			Chancellor, I'll admit Mirasta's
			enthusiasm for her work is
			seductive, but perhaps we're
			moving too fast...
			As fast as the speed of light,
			Krola...
			Why am I always the only realist
			in a room full of dreamers... ?
			Please, I must be serious...
			there was another demonstration
			today... some violence. Your
			opponents will see this as another
			example of your determination to
			pull us further from our
			traditional ways...
			My opponents look back as I look
			forward. I cannot believe that
			my people would choose to retreat
			after all we've done...
			I agree.
			The people were willing to accept
			your social reforms because they
			believe in you, Chancellor. But
			there are many who say we have
			gone far enough... all of these
			new ideas... new technology...
			and now space travel... it
			confuses them, frightens them...
			And I will not allow them to
			remain in the dark ages... the
			warp program will proceed as you
			have outlined, Mirasta...
			And then we will slow down, Krola,
			to let everyone catch their breath
			including you...
			Excuse me, Mirasta Yale?
			Yes?
			My name is Jean-Luc Picard. This
			is my associate Deanna Troi. May
			we come in?
			Who are you?
			Please don't be alarmed by our
			appearance... we've come with
			some... important information.
			About what?
			About space. About the universe
			you are preparing to enter.
			We are from a federation of
			planets, Mirasta... Captain Picard
			is from a planet called Earth more
			than two thousand light years from
			here. I am from another planet
			called Betazed.
			Uh huh.
			We have been monitoring your
			progress toward warp drive
			capability. When a society
			reaches your level of technology
			and is clearly about to initiate
			warp travel, we believe it is time
			to make first contact. We prefer
			meeting like this rather than a
			random confrontation in deep
			space.
			We've come to you first because
			you are a leader in the scientific
			community. And scientists can
			generally accept our arrival more
			easily than others.
			We almost always encounter fear
			and shock on this sort of mission.
			We hope you will be able to help
			facilitate our introduction.
			Is this a joke? Did Lupo and the
			others at the lab put you up to
			this?
			I assure you this is no joke.
			You can see we are quite
			physically different than
			Malcorians.
			And with your permission, I am
			prepared to prove what I am
			saying.
			All right...
			Picard to Enterprise. Three to
			beam up.
			Welcome aboard.
			It's beyond words... everything
			I've ever dreamed about...
			When I was a child, my parents
			would take me to the
			planetarium... and we would sit
			in the dark and it was as if I
			was on a spaceship on my way to
			another world... to meet people
			from other planets...
			Now that you're about to travel
			beyond your own solar system, you
			will meet a great many more people
			from other planets, Mirasta...
			The Federation prefers to make
			first contact like this... rather
			than a random confrontation in
			deep space.
			A part of me still expects the
			lights to come up as the program
			ends...
			How did you know about me?
			We try to learn as much as
			possible about a planet before
			first contact.
			One of the things we do is monitor
			broadcast signals... We listen
			to your journalism, your music,
			your humor... try to better
			understand you as a people...
			I hate to think how you would
			judge us based on our popular
			music and entertainment.
			To be sure, we get an incomplete
			picture from long distance...
			that's why we also do on-surface
			reconnaissance.
			You've had people on our planet?
			For several years.
			We've found that the most
			hazardous aspect of this kind
			of mission is a lack of sufficient
			information...
			You don't have to explain. I
			understand.
			But not everyone on my planet
			would. They'd think you were
			trying to infiltrate our society.
			We do have a complication here,
			Mirasta. One of our people is
			missing. My first officer,
			Commander William Riker.
			He was on the surface to
			coordinate the final details with
			our observation team when he
			disappeared. Our people have made
			inquiries... but we have not been
			able to locate him. If there's
			any way you can help...
			Of course. Where was Riker's last
			known location?
			The capital city. He was there
			under the name of Rivas Jakara,
			a tourist from the Marta
			community.
			We've got to find him before
			someone realizes what he really
			is... if this gets out prematurely,
			it will seriously complicate
			matters.
			Introducing you to this world
			will not be an easy matter.
			It never is.
			You must already know that my
			people are in a transitory
			stage... an old staid culture
			has been pulled into the future
			by Chancellor Durken... but it
			is not easy to discard deep-rooted
			beliefs. Our entire ideology is
			based on the assumption that the
			Malcorian is the supreme lifeform
			and that our world is the center
			of the universe. Your arrival
			will change our entire
			understanding of life...
			Some will not want it to change.
			What about Durken?
			Durken will be open-minded. But
			cautious. I strongly suggest that
			you do not discuss your
			surveillance teams with him...
			not right away at least.
			But, with the disappearance of
			Commander Riker, wouldn't it be
			prudent...
			Captain Picard, you must trust
			me on this. If you tell the
			Chancellor about Commander Riker,
			it would undermine everything you
			hope to accomplish here.
			Durken would assign Krola, the
			Minister of Security, to find him.
			Krola has his own political
			agenda. He will perceive you as
			the greatest threat my people have
			ever known. And he will not
			hesitate to use Riker to prove
			he is correct.
			It doesn't make sense that he's
			the only one... think about it...
			From another planet, hundreds of
			them... invasion from space...
			Somebody said he's not bad
			looking... what if that's just
			a disguise... meat-eaters... I've
			heard he can see through walls...
			thousands of them...
			I thought I said this was to be
			kept a secret...
			You know Nilrem...
			Well, it's getting out of
			control...
			... I don't know what else he is,
			but he's still a patient in this
			medical facility and we have a
			responsibility for his care and
			recovery... remind them of that,
			will you?
			Berel, you're not going to be able
			to contain this much longer.
			I know.
			If people get scared enough,
			anything could happen...
			Mister Jakara, we have been unable
			to confirm anything you told us.
			No physician named Crusher is on
			file... not on this planet...
			Your address in Marta is an eating
			establishment... the cook has
			never heard of Rivas Jakara.
			There's obviously been some
			misunderstanding...
			There's a growing number of people
			on the other side of that door
			who believe you are not one of
			us.
			Not one of you... ?
			That you're from another planet.
			Are you, Mister Jakara?
			Do you realize what you're saying?
			I know how it sounds. And I am
			not anxious to make a fool of
			myself.
			Mister Jakara, this new era of
			space flight, it does fire the
			imagination. People see
			unidentified vessels in the sky
			that turn out to be weather
			balloons.
			It is far more likely that I'm
			a weather balloon than an alien.
			Our medical journals have
			documented several cases of
			genetic mutation in recent
			history... some unusual physical
			disfigurations have occurred...
			I guess I'm another case for the
			medical journals then...
			Perhaps. But you, Mister Jakara,
			are hiding something. Unless you
			tell me the truth about yourself,
			this rumor will persist and grow
			and could even become dangerous.
			Most especially to you.
			... the delegate from the Central
			Province at four-point-three...
			the conference with capitol
			journalists is at six-point-one...
			and Minister Yale of the Space
			Bureau would like to introduce
			you to someone...
			Call her back and see if the
			Vice-Chancellor will do...
			They're out here waiting to see
			you, sir...
			All right. Send them in.
			Always time to meet your friends,
			Mirasta.
			Chancellor, please sit down...
			you may want to clear your
			afternoon schedule for this.
			The security chief and a medical
			officer are always present during
			a first contact transport -- a
			matter of policy... we've learned
			to expect the unexpected...
			Your fortitude is impressive,
			Chancellor... my knees buckled
			the moment we... we... what do
			you call it... ?
			"Beamed up"...
			Yes, beamed up...
			It sounds as though you have done
			this quite often.
			Personally, I have been involved
			with four first contact missions.
			And what happened to those other
			four planets?
			They're still there, Chancellor.
			This is their warp drive,
			Chancellor. Do you believe it... ?
			Our theories were correct...
			I can only imagine the sort of
			armaments your vessel carries,
			Captain Picard.
			This vessel also carries families
			and children, Chancellor. It is
			not a warship. The Federation
			is dedicated to the peaceful
			exploration of space.
			And do you expect all the worlds
			you contact to become members
			of your federation?
			Not at all, Chancellor. Some
			desire membership. Some do not.
			And in some cases the
			philosophical differences are so
			great, it is not even a
			consideration...
			This is my bridge.
			Captain.
			Mister Data. Allow me to
			introduce Chancellor Avel Durken
			and Space Administrator Mirasta
			Yale.
			How do you do?
			Data is my Second Officer.
			He is an android, Chancellor.
			A constructed being.
			A machine?
			In a manner of speaking. The term
			"artificial lifeform" is more
			accurate.
			Chancellor.
			Captain Picard. Is there
			somewhere we might speak together?
			Without distraction?
			Chancellor, with your permission,
			I will... beam back to the
			surface.
			I have several matters to attend
			to.
			Not a word to anyone about this,
			Mirasta.
			Of course.
			Mister Data will escort you to
			the transporter room.
			Has there still been no
			communication from Commander
			Riker, Data?
			No, Minister. He has not returned
			to our designated transport
			coordinates. We have continued
			to scan the capitol city without
			success.
			I've been saving this for a
			special occasion. My brother on
			Earth produces fruit known as
			grapes which he turns into wine.
			He's really quite good at it.
			We have a tradition, Chancellor,
			called a toast... a drink to
			salute one's friends and good
			fortune. I propose a toast to
			a new friendship.
			We have something very much like
			this here on Malcor Three.
			I am sure we will find much in
			common.
			And much that is not in common.
			An opportunity to learn from one
			another.
			You speak the language of
			diplomacy very well, Captain
			Picard... it is a language I
			appreciate and understand... but
			I have learned to not always trust
			it...
			Trust requires time and
			experience...
			My world's history has recorded
			that conquerors often arrived
			with the words, "we are your
			friends."
			Chancellor, we are not here to
			conquer.
			What do you want?
			Today, all I wish to have is a
			drink between friends.
			A beginning. How we proceed is
			entirely up to you...
			And if my wishes conflict with
			yours... ?
			There will be no conflict.
			And if I were to tell you to leave
			and never return to my world...
			We would leave and never return.
			We are only here to help guide
			you... into a new era. I assure
			you we will not interfere with
			the natural development of your
			planet... that is, in fact, our
			Prime Directive.
			I could infer from that directive
			that you do not intend to share
			all this extraordinary technology
			with us...
			That is not the whole meaning...
			but it is part of it.
			Is that your way of maintaining
			superiority?
			To instantly transform a society
			with technology would be harmful
			and destructive...
			You're right of course.
			I am overwhelmed, Captain Picard.
			Quite overwhelmed.
			I come home each night to a loving
			wife and two beautiful
			daughters... we eat the evening
			meal together as a family, I feel
			that's important... and they
			always ask me if I've had a good
			day.
			How shall you answer them tonight,
			Chancellor?
			Well, I'll have to say... this
			morning, I was the leader of the
			universe as I knew it... this
			afternoon, I am only a voice in
			a chorus.
			But I think it was a good day.
			There are guards out there.
			You'll never escape that way.
			I'm not afraid of you.
			Good. Because there's nothing
			to be afraid of...
			We shouldn't fear the unknown.
			We should embrace it.
			Can you help me get out of here?
			Are you really an alien? It's
			all right to tell me.
			No, I'm not an alien...
			I don't believe you. You are an
			alien.
			Listen, I really have to leave...
			I could divert the guard's
			attention. You might have a
			chance if you took the service
			exit down the hall to the left...
			To the left. All right. Let's
			do it.
			Why should I?
			You know why. Because I don't
			belong here. Because I have to
			get back to my ship in space.
			I believe you.
			Now, will you help me?
			If you make love to me.
			What?
			I've always wanted to make love
			with an alien.
			Listen, Miss...
			Lanel...
			I really have to get going... all
			the... other aliens are expecting
			me...
			It's not so much to ask. And then
			I'll help you escape.
			It's not that easy. There are...
			differences... in the way my
			people make love.
			I can't wait to learn.
			But...
			It's your only way out of here...
			my alien...
			Something's happened to him...
			I think he's dead... hurry, go
			get help...
			Okay...
			Will I ever see you again... ?
			I'll call you next time I'm
			passing through your star system.
			Hey!
			Stop him! Somebody stop him!
			He's escaping! The alien's
			escaping!
			He's loose! Get him! Don't let
			him get away! Kill him! Stop
			him! Where's he going? He's
			dangerous! Block the exits!
			Knock him down! Kill him!
			Leave him alone!
			Stop it! All of you! Stop it
			now!
			Have you all lost your minds?
			They've aggravateded the injury
			to his telencephalin... he's
			bleeding internally...
			Get him into a surgical cubicle...
			And call Central Security. This
			has gone too far.
			Recommendation?
			I don't know... it doesn't match
			anything...
			Forget your training. What do
			you see?
			The ichor pooling under the
			cranial bone... it seems to be
			exerting abnormal pressure.
			Ordinarily, I'd say we have
			to drill to relieve it.
			Agreed.
			Suction...
			Three-point-six aspiration drill.
			I wonder what his own kind would
			do for him...
			I have to believe it'd be better
			than this...
			Their leader, Picard, has made
			it clear that how we proceed is
			entirely our own decision...
			You cannot possibly be suggesting
			surrender, Chancellor...
			They are not hostile...
			Mirasta, you are incredibly naive.
			Can you be so enraptured with the
			notion of space travellers that
			you are blind to the threat they
			represent... ?
			I have seen their vessel, Krola...
			if they chose to be hostile, I
			don't think we would be standing
			here now...
			Why should they use force when
			we are ready to lay down in
			fear...
			I do not lay down in fear... to
			them or to you, Krola.
			Chancellor, I mean no disrespect.
			But I have repeatedly warned you
			about your policies... taking us
			so quickly where we had no
			business going in the first
			place... New philosophies, new
			economics, new technologies.
			There are many people who still
			value our traditional way of
			life... and I for one am willing
			to die to defend it.
			Open your eyes, Krola. We are
			part of a greater community now.
			We cannot ignore it.
			You would ignore them... as they
			infiltrate and spy on us...
			What are you saying, Krola?
			We have captured one of their
			spies.
			Chancellor, he is Captain Picard's
			first officer, Commander Riker.
			You knew about this?
			He has been missing for two days.
			I told Captain Picard not to
			discuss it because I was afraid
			this is exactly what would
			happen...
			What else do you know, Mirasta?
			Everything.
			They've been on our planet,
			observing us for several years...
			Years... Imagine what they have
			done... influenced our young,
			stirred up dissent...
			They were collecting
			information...
			Where is this Commander Riker now?
			You will not discuss this with
			Picard or the other aliens. If
			you are not comfortable with that,
			Mirasta, you may leave now.
			He is at the Sikla Medical
			facility, recovering from
			surgery... he suffered head
			injuries in an attempt to escape.
			He will recover consciousness in
			a few hours.
			Will he survive?
			I didn't think he would have
			survived the injuries. The real
			question is can he survive the
			treatment..
			I have to interrogate him before
			he dies.
			At least give him time to regain
			some strength. Come back
			tomorrow.
			It cannot wait until tomorrow.
			Krola, we can get help from his
			ship. With their medical
			technology, he might recover.
			We're not giving him back. He
			is the one advantage we have now.
			Use your drugs to revive him...
			Those drugs increase cardial rate
			and vascular pressure... that's
			the last thing we want to do to
			him right now...
			It will probably be enough to kill
			him... you can't do it...
			Revive him.
			I'm just a physician, Minister.
			I don't know much about affairs
			of state. But he is a living,
			intelligent being. I don't care
			if the Chancellor himself calls
			down here. I have sworn an oath
			to do no harm. And I will not.
			Then I will find someone to
			replace you.
			He won't have any trouble finding
			someone, you know.
			Chancellor...
			You are punctual, Captain.
			I know how busy you are.
			Do you?
			I think you know a great deal more
			about me than I know about you.
			In what respect?
			I can't know what motivates you...
			how you make decisions... what
			value you place on life... you
			speak of trust and peace and
			working together to enter a new
			era... at the same time you
			conduct secret surveillance...
			posing as Malcorians...
			Commander Riker.
			Commander Riker.
			Mirasta felt it would be a
			mistake to discuss...
			Yes, she's tried to accept the
			responsibility.
			You're right. It was my error,
			not hers.
			Chancellor, no starship mission
			is more dangerous than first
			contact. We never know what we
			face when we open the door to a
			new world. How will we be
			greeted? What are the dangers?
			Centuries ago, a disastrous first
			contact with the Klingon Empire
			led to decades of war. It was
			decided then that we must do
			surveillance before making
			contact. It was a controversial
			decision. But I believe it
			prevents more problems than it
			creates.
			I appreciate the logic of your
			position, Captain. But it would
			seem a full disclosure after
			contact would have been in order.
			In time, there would have been
			full disclosure. I know I can
			only ask you to believe that.
			On some worlds, it is not even
			an issue. But here, everything
			our observers reported suggested
			the people of this world would
			almost certainly react negatively
			to our arrival. We could see
			our surveillance might even be
			interpreted as an act of
			aggression.
			I was hoping that we would find
			Commander Riker before you did...
			so the matter would not
			complicate our introduction. And
			it was a mistake.
			A mistake I might have made in
			your place.
			I rather like it actually.
			Like it?
			That you make mistakes like any
			man.
			Oh, I've made some fine ones in
			my time.
			Will you release my officer?
			We'll talk again later, Captain.
			Enterprise, one to beam up.
			Yes I understand.
			I've been relieved of my duties...
			as I'm sure you already know.
			You are acting director of the
			facility, Nilrem.
			Revive him.
			Leave us.
			I am Minister Krola from Internal
			Security. You are Riker, an
			alien...
			Yes, we know.
			Please. Bring my people here.
			In time. In time. But first,
			I need to ask you some
			questions...
			Thank you for seeing me.
			If I did not depend so much on
			your expertise in space matters,
			I would have asked for your
			resignation.
			I felt I was acting in the best
			interests of our people,
			Chancellor.
			When you are selected to occupy
			this office, then you'll have the
			privilege of deciding the best
			interests of our people.
			Picard, I can excuse. But you,
			Mirasta, you should have trusted
			me.
			Chancellor -- we must release
			Riker to Picard... Any hope for
			a relationship with these people
			depends on it...
			I cannot afford to be the idealist
			you are, Mirasta.
			Riker...
			I am prepared to release Riker
			after we've interrogated him...
			Are you prepared for him to die,
			Chancellor?
			His injuries are extremely
			serious. A mob at the medical
			facility almost killed him. Krola
			has ordered drugs to be used to
			revive him for questioning, drugs
			that are dangerous in his
			condition. Without medical aid
			from his ship, I believe Riker
			will not survive the day. You
			must tell Picard where he is.
			You have lied since the moment
			of your capture... and I believe
			you are lying now, Commander.
			We... are here on a mission of
			peace...
			Such noble creatures.
			Why do peaceful people develop
			such lethal weapons?
			Or do you still insist it is a
			toy?
			Yes, my experts were able to make
			it function. An interesting toy
			to be sure.
			It is... for defense...
			Perhaps, like many conquerors,
			you believe your goals to be
			benevolent. I cannot. For
			however you would describe your
			intentions, you still represent
			the end to my way of life. I
			cannot permit that to occur.
			Eventually, Durken would choose
			to welcome your people with arms
			open and eyes closed. I must
			force him down another path.
			When they find us, I will be dead,
			killed by your weapon. The lines
			will be drawn. A peaceful accord
			will no longer be an option.
			No...
			For my people.
			Captain, Chancellor Durken has
			requested your immediate presence
			on the surface. It's in regard
			to Commander Riker.
			Acknowledged, Lieutenant.
			Life signs failing on one...
			... he's dying, Nilrem... you
			can't just stand here... or can
			you... ?
			What... ?
			He shot him. The alien shot
			Krola...
			I'm a physician... don't be
			frightened...
			What happened?
			The... he shot him...
			with that thing...
			Crusher to Picard.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			Commander Riker is near death.
			But there is still brain
			activity... I've got to take
			him back to the ship...
			Acknowledged.
			Minister Krola has a phaser wound
			in his upper chest.
			I should take him with us.
			We'll meet you on the
			Enterprise.
			Enterprise, five to beam up...
			directly to Sickbay...
			energize...
			They're both going to be okay...
			we were able to stabilize Will...
			if we'd been any later...
			Krola?
			He was never in any real danger...
			the phaser was on stun...
			Stun?
			It is a defensive weapon. We do
			not use it to kill.
			Have you been able to ascertain
			what happened?
			I have a good idea. Based on the
			angle of impact... it suggests
			that Krola had his right hand on
			the phaser when it went off...
			They were struggling for the
			weapon?
			Commander Riker was in no position
			to offer any kind of struggle,
			Chancellor.
			Krola was trying to be a
			martyr... ?
			Where is this?
			You are aboard the starship, my
			foolish old friend.
			No. Chancellor... you must not...
			you must not pursue relations with
			them... you must not...
			I know. I know.
			But Chancellor...
			Mirasta, it goes against every
			instinct in my being...
			... but my people are not ready
			to accept what you represent.
			Everything that happened at the
			hospital proves it. Krola is the
			best evidence of all. We must
			slow down and allow all those like
			him to join us in the present
			before we move into the future.
			But when we encounter other beings
			in space, our people must be
			ready...
			The warp program will have to be
			delayed... we will divert more
			resources into education and
			social development to prepare for
			the day when we are ready.
			Chancellor, I strongly disagree.
			I know.
			Captain Picard, you once said that
			if I ask you to leave, you would
			without hesitation. I'm afraid
			I must ask you to do just that.
			It is your decision, Chancellor.
			But I must say I regret that we
			won't have the opportunity of
			knowing your people better.
			We are a good people, Captain.
			A society with much potential.
			Once we cross this threshold of
			space, we will have to give up
			the self-importance, the conceit
			that we are the center of the
			universe.
			But this is not the time. For
			now, it is better that we continue
			to enjoy that sweet innocence.
			But how can you keep us a
			secret... when so many have seen
			and heard so much?
			The stories will be told for many
			years, I have no doubt... of the
			ship that made contact... of an
			alien who was held prisoner in
			a medical facility... there will
			be charges of a government
			cover-up... some of the witnesses
			will tell their tales and most
			people will laugh at them and go
			back and watch more interesting
			fiction on the daily broadcasts.
			It will pass.
			I'm sorry to say... he's probably
			right.
			Captain, I have one last
			request... take me with you.
			She will be unhappy with the
			restrictions I must place on her
			at home, Captain.
			We may not be back in your
			lifetime. And I have to believe
			that you are not fully prepared
			for the risks of space, Mirasta...
			I have been prepared for the risks
			of space since I was nine years
			old sitting in a planetarium.
			Mister Worf, to my Ready Room...
			Escort Chancellor Durken to the
			transporter room, Lieutenant...
			and then assign quarters to
			Minister Yale. She'll be staying
			on board.
			Aye, sir.
			Until we return then...
			With luck, we will both still
			be around to renew our friendship,
			Captain.
