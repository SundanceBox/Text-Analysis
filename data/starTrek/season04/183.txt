			Captain's log, stardate 44307.3.
			I am preparing to leave by
			shuttlecraft for Pentarus Five,
			where I have been asked to mediate
			a dispute among the salenite
			miners -- a contentious group
			unfortunately prone to violence.
			At the same time, I must deal with
			a situation of a far more personal
			nature.
			Ensign, I summoned you almost ten
			minutes ago!
			Yes, sir, I know, but I was in
			the middle of an experiment using
			some volatile compounds and I
			couldn't just leave them lying
			out --
			Excuses, Mister Crusher?
			No, sir, not at all, it was more
			of an explanation --
			Because I assure you that will
			not go over well at Starfleet
			Academy.
			I know, sir, but --
			The Academy?
			I just got the message from
			Admiral Nsomeka. She expects
			you to report in two weeks.
			A position has opened up in this
			year's class. You'll have to work
			overtime to catch up, but I have
			assured the Commander that you
			will be capable of that. Please
			don't make a liar of me.
			Oh, yes sir! I mean -- no, sir.
			And as your final mission aboard
			the Enterprise... I'd like you
			to accompany me to Pentarus while
			I try to sort things out with the
			miners.
			Yes, sir...
			Mister Riker tells me you've been
			studying the effects of outpost
			judiciary decisions on Federation
			Law. What better way to get
			first-hand experience?
			Captain, I am picking up a general
			distress signal from Gamelan Five.
			On screen.
			Please... Does anyone read us?
			Open channel.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			Captain... I am Chairman Songi,
			of Gamelan Four. An unidentified
			spacecraft has entered orbit above
			our planet. Radiation levels in
			our atmosphere have increased by
			three thousand percent. We can
			only assume we are under attack
			-- but the ship will not answer
			our hails! We are a peaceful
			planet... we have no ability to
			defend ourselves. Please, can
			you help us?
			Mister Data, are we close enough
			for a scan?
			Nossir, we are out of range.
			Any other ships near that system?
			Negative, Commander.
			Very well. Chairman Songi, we
			will proceed immediately to your
			planet.
			Thank you, Captain Picard...
			Mister Riker, take the Enterprise
			and investigate the problem.
			Ensign Crusher and I will proceed
			to Pentarus Five.
			The miners have sent a shuttle.
			We'll depart in ten minutes.
			Your maneuvering thrusters are
			rigged in a configuration I
			haven't seen before.
			My own modification. It's more
			efficient. You can study it if
			you want...
			I've run operational and safety
			inspections, Captain. It checks
			out. I won't make any claims for
			comfort.
			Captain Picard... Captain Dirgo,
			of the shuttlecraft "Nenebek".
			Ah -- Captain. Good to meet you.
			"Captain?" Of a mining shuttle?
			Yes, Ensign -- Captain. My ship
			isn't pretty, and she isn't big
			-- but we've logged almost ten
			thousand hours together.
			It seems a very -- sturdy --
			craft.
			We should go. Will you take Ops,
			Captain?
			I'll let Ensign Crusher perform
			that task. I need to study up
			on Regalian law.
			Crusher to Bridge...
			Go ahead, Mister Crusher.
			Shuttlecraft Nenebek prepared
			for departure.
			Acknowledged, Ensign. Begin
			launch sequence.
			Launch sequence confirmed...
			Shuttlecraft has cleared the bay.
			Ensign Allenby, set a course for
			the Gamelan system... Warp Six.
			Aye, Sir.
			You've done this before.
			Yes...
			If your Captain isn't tougher than
			he looks, those miners will tear
			him apart.
			Don't worry about Captain Picard
			-- he'll handle them.
			I've lost navigation --
			The port thruster quad is gone,
			guidance coupling is severed --
			I can't stabilize her!
			The port thruster module blew...
			Nenebek to Enterprise...
			emergency... do you read?
			Pentarus station... come in...
			Communication is gone --
			Is your navigational system
			functioning?
			Negative. Switching to manual.
			Estimated position... ?
			Fifty million kilometers from
			Pentarus Five... we may have to
			put down somewhere else...
			Mister Crusher, scan for a class
			M environment...
			Aye, sir.
			We'll lose the main impulse engine
			if I don't throttle it down.
			One of the moons of Pentarus
			Three... it's class M -- barely
			-- mean temperature fifty-five
			degrees Celsius...
			Life forms indicated?
			Negative. But sensors are
			limited. There's an intense
			magnetic field near the surface.
			We don't have a choice.
			Save the impulse engine for a
			controlled entry.
			Ensign, reconfigure the working
			thrusters to manual inputs.
			I'll try, sir -- but this grid
			looks about a hundred years old...
			I don't have the Federation's
			resources...
			Captain... will you take the helm?
			I'm rerouting the deuterium
			flow --
			We'll have to manually trip the
			bypass from the main engine to
			the thrusters...
			Where'd you learn that?
			We've got power reconfigured,
			Captain.
			Hull temperature seven hundred
			degrees --
			Beginning braking maneuver.
			We're below Mach One! Bypass
			to thrusters now!
			Let's salvage what we can.
			The first thing we'll need is
			shelter from the sun. In this
			heat, the shuttle will act like
			an oven.
			All systems are out. Can't get
			a communication channel. Location
			transponder's gone, too.
			We'll have to check the craft for
			something to protect our heads
			and eyes... and Captain, please
			recover your medical supplies...
			food and water rations...
			The medical supplies are all
			right...
			But... food and water?
			A replicator... damaged beyond
			repair.
			Surely... you have emergency
			supplies.
			This isn't a starship! I have
			to choose what I carry!
			Are you telling me... that we have
			no water?
			Scanning. Vessel reads as an
			unmanned sublight freighter.
			Origin?
			Indeterminate. Propulsion appears
			to employ a gaseous-core fission
			reactor, but it is not functioning.
			The radiation levels coming from
			that ship are off the scale.
			Mister Data, could that be
			leakage from their engines?
			No sir. Engine reactor elements
			appear to have been inactive for
			approximately three hundred years.
			The vessel is carrying various
			unstable waste products.
			You mean... it's a garbage scow.
			Precisely.
			Mister Worf, open a hailing
			frequency.
			Chairman Songi, this is Commander
			Riker on board the Enterprise.
			Yes, Commander.
			It appears you've inherited
			someone else's problem... It's
			an old waste vessel... caught by
			your planet's gravitational pull.
			Have your people begun to suffer
			from radiation sickness?
			Not yet. But some areas are
			already detecting dangerous
			levels.
			We'll do our best to get it out
			of here as quickly as possible.
			Thank you, Commander.
			We're going to give that barge
			a push into the Gamelan sun.
			Sir, the Meltasion Asteroid Belt
			lies between here and the sun.
			Then we'll have to take it
			ourselves and have our
			deflectors clear a safe path
			through the asteroids.
			I don't like the idea of getting
			close enough to that barge to tow
			it. The radiation levels are so
			high we'd be risking contamination
			of the entire crew.
			Got a better idea, Geordi?
			We could send over a construction
			module to attach thrusters to it.
			Then we could direct it through
			the asteroid belt from a safe
			distance.
			Commander... a message from the
			mining settlement on Pentarus.
			The shuttle carrying Captain
			Picard has not yet arrived.
			They left here at oh-eight-hundred
			hours...
			They have asked if we will be
			starting a search.
			Tell them we have an emergency
			situation here... we'll start a
			search after we've dealt with it.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister La Forge, prepare to launch
			the construction module. Let's
			get this over with as fast as we
			can.
			Mister Crusher, any luck with that
			tricorder?
			I think so, sir. The scanning
			range may be limited, but it's
			better than nothing.
			These were on board, Captain.
			They're working.
			Excellent. Now --
			Our communicators may not be able
			to get a signal through this
			strong a magnetic field... so I've
			fashioned an arrow. If a search
			party finds the wreckage, they'll
			know we've headed for those
			mountains.
			Are you crazy?
			It's too far away. We'll never
			make it.
			We can't survive out here in the
			sun.
			Where there are mountains, there
			is shelter.
			You have no right to make the
			decisions! I'm Captain of this
			ship!
			If you want to get out of this,
			I suggest you listen. Captain
			Picard is the one who's going to
			keep us alive --
			Thank you, Ensign, that's enough.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain Dirgo, you're an able
			pilot and I welcome your input.
			Do you feel there's an alternative
			we're overlooking?
			No.
			Very well. I suggest a steady
			pace, but not a brisk one. We
			need to ration our energy. Try
			to breathe through your nose, it
			will help prevent dehydration.
			I'll lead... Captain Dirgo, will
			you bring up the rear?
			And you were worried about how
			tough the Captain is?
			Did you find water?
			No... not yet...
			What are you doing with that?
			Mister Crusher?
			I'm not sure, sir... an energy
			reading.
			Energy reading? What kind?
			Low frequency E-M. It's been
			getting stronger... the closer
			we get to those mountains.
			What are you saying? There's
			something over there? Waiting
			for us?
			I don't know what it is. It just
			registers as a repeating energy
			pattern...
			Ensign, are you suggesting this
			energy is not naturally occurring?
			The readings could be indicating
			some electromagnetic property in
			the rocks... but I don't think so.
			A life form?
			It's possible... the pattern's
			fairly organized...
			We can't go back... and we can't
			stay here. We have to keep going
			to the mountains. No matter
			what's waiting there.
			There has to be water in here...
			aren't caves formed by water?
			Not necessarily... they could
			have been created by volcanic
			activity -- lava flows.
			These walls are dry... Mister
			Crusher, do you get any moisture
			reading?
			No, sir... But that E-M reading?
			The pattern has changed... and
			the frequency is peaking a lot
			higher...
			You have water!
			I wouldn't hide water...
			It's called dresci... from my
			planet.
			Alcohol.
			It's -- medicinal. For
			emergencies.
			I was going to share it with
			you...
			This won't quench your thirst...
			it will only make it worse.
			I'll take my chances...
			I'm not going to let you waste
			this. It's more valuable to us
			as a coolant or a disinfectant.
			It's mine!
			Mister Crusher, stow this with
			the medical supplies and keep your
			eye on it.
			Yes, sir.
			Now we're going to explore this
			cave. Mister Crusher, look for
			any indication of water, no matter
			how faint. Captain Dirgo -- will
			you lead the way?
			We're projecting that the bulk
			of the radiation will affect three
			small island groups.
			Fortunately, they're sparsely
			populated. We'll start
			replicating hyronalin now and be
			ready to transport it to them if
			it becomes necessary. Please
			coordinate with the medical
			personnel on the planet.
			We've contacted the nearest
			Starbase for a search vessel...
			I'm afraid the closest one is
			almost a week away...
			I see. Thank you.
			But we have asked the mining
			settlement to send out any vessels
			they might have.
			You know, there are many reasons
			why the shuttle might have been
			delayed...
			Deanna -- thank you. But I'm all
			right. And for now, I have work
			to do.
			Commander... the miners report
			that they have very few operable
			shuttle craft. They want to know
			when we will be joining the
			search.
			Tell them to stand by. If this
			works, we'll be on our way.
			Thrusters are attached and ready,
			Commander.
			Initiate prefire sequence.
			Prefire command transmitted.
			Thrusters to standby.
			Fire thrusters... gradual
			acceleration to forty percent
			power.
			We've lost one module. Correcting
			thrust vectors to compensate.
			Structural integrity of the barge
			has been compromised.
			Disintegration is continuing.
			Shut down thrusters! Ensign, take
			us one thousand meters ahead of
			the barge and hold.
			External radiation levels are
			increasing.
			Coming into position at one
			thousand meters.
			Mister Worf, extend shields around
			the ship and lock on a tractor
			beam.
			Aye, sir.
			Warning. Radiation levels at
			seventy millirads per minute and
			rising.
			Allenby, set a new course. We're
			going to take it through the
			asteroid belt ourselves. One-quarter
			impulse.
			Aye, sir.
			Doctor Crusher to the Bridge.
			On my way.
			Data... I need a projection of
			the radiation impact on the
			crew... Worf...
			... signal the mining settlement.
			Tell them -- we won't be joining
			the search for awhile.
			There's light up ahead!
			Captain... water!
			I knew there had to be water!
			Mister Crusher... what was that?
			It seems to be some kind of
			tightly confined annular force
			field...
			Put there to protect the water.
			Then there has to be a way to
			de-activate it...
			We can with our phasers.
			I think it might be wiser if...
			The E-M pattern again -- the
			power level's really spiking
			now...
			Look... I think it's working!
			Dirgo...
			Stop firing!
			Help me!
			Dirgo -- move!
			Keep pressure on that wound!
			This is the worst break... ?
			What was that thing... ?
			Keep the pressure constant.
			Ensign... how bad is it?
			You have a broken leg... Your
			left arm is... I think there's
			a fracture there, too. And you
			took a bad blow to the head. But
			we're getting the bleeding under
			control.
			Good work... I'm going to be fine
			in a moment... just need to catch
			my breath...
			Tell him the truth.
			What truth?
			He's bleeding inside. I've seen
			it before. He'll never survive.
			You don't know what you're talking
			about.
			You're wasting your time. Save
			the dresci for us.
			Mister Dirgo -- I'd appreciate
			it if you didn't bury me before
			I'm gone.
			The trouble is... he may be right.
			No, he's not -- you're going to
			be fine...
			Captain... ?
			For a moment... I saw your
			father's face in yours...
			He wouldn't give up, either... even
			when things looked bleakest, even
			on that terrible afternoon...
			Strange, I always remember it as
			night. Maybe... sudden,
			unnecessary death ought to happen
			at night... not on a bright
			cloudless afternoon...
			Wesley... you're going to have
			to keep a rein on Dirgo... he's
			willful, stubborn... that could
			be dangerous...
			You'll handle him, sir.
			Listen to me. I have no feeling
			in my right leg. My vision is
			blurred... I'm going to get worse,
			not better. I won't be able to
			help you, Wesley. You'll have
			to stand up to him on your own.
			Yes, sir.
			Good man...
			First Officer's log, stardate
			44307.6. Radiation levels on the
			Enterprise continue to rise. The
			ventilation system has started
			pumping hyronalin into our air
			supply to counteract the effects.
			At the rate the radiation levels
			are increasing, the hyronalin
			additive will only be effective
			for another thirty-eight minutes.
			Crusher to Medical Unit One.
			Evacuate and seal off all
			non-operational areas. Group the
			crew and families in the interior
			corridors of decks nine and ten,
			radiation exposure protocol.
			Acknowledged, Doctor
			Data... at our current speed, how
			long will it take us to get
			through the asteroid belt?
			Fifty-one minutes, fourteen
			seconds.
			We're going to have a lot of
			casualties if we can't get there
			any faster.
			Geordi, how much more can the
			tractor beam take?
			We're already at the upper limit
			for towing speed, Commander.
			Then let's see if we can establish
			a new upper limit...
			Aye, sir...
			Data, monitor the shearing effect
			on the beam... increasing to
			one-half impulse.
			Tractor beam is holding...
			shearing force eighty metric tons
			per meter...
			Increasing to three-quarters
			impulse.
			Shearing force ninety-two metric
			tons... ninety-three... tractor
			beam is destabilizing... we are
			going to lose the barge,
			Commander...
			Reduce power.
			One-half impulse.
			Geordi, you gotta stabilize the
			tractor beam...
			I can't divert any more power
			to the shields... we're already
			hitting maximum thermal limits...
			Only other choice is to bring
			some other fusion reactors on
			line... but we're running at
			peak coolant pressure...
			Do it.
			Warning. Radiation levels at one
			hundred fifty millirads per
			minute and rising. Lethal
			exposure in thirty-five minutes.
			Look at that.
			How did this happen?
			That -- thing -- did it.
			Selenium fibers... electrically
			deposited.
			The E-M pattern is back down...
			it only surged when we tried to
			get to the water...
			Whatever it was we saw... it
			almost acts like a sentry. To
			guard the fountain.
			As long as we aren't moving toward
			the water, the wave pattern stays
			low... right between five and
			fifteen hertz... Dirgo, walk
			toward the fountain.
			That's it! The frequency went
			to forty.
			What is this getting us? We've
			got to get to the water!
			If I could find a way to
			manipulate the frequency, I might
			be able to control it.
			The Sentry appeared when we
			started using phasers. Maybe it
			responds to heat... or to
			collinated energy...
			If you're right... we can use a
			phaser to lure it away.
			Hold on... we need to figure out
			what it is, before we start doing
			anything to it.
			Enough talk. Enough thinking.
			It's time to do something.
			I'll start firing. When it comes
			-- you fire and draw it off.
			No, we can't...
			Then set your phaser on automatic
			and take cover.
			And how do you know it'll go for
			my phaser, not yours?
			Because... I'll fire mine on the
			lowest setting. You use maximum.
			There's no evidence that it
			responds differently to higher
			settings... we have to figure
			out our options before we --
			And while we're doing that, your
			Captain is dying.
			With those wounds, most men would
			already be dead. If he doesn't
			get water...
			When I start firing -- you better
			do your part.
			First Officer's log, supplemental.
			Mister La Forge has diverted
			power from auxiliary fusion
			generators in an attempt to
			stabilize the tractor beam. This
			is the only hope of increasing
			our towing speed so we can clear
			the asteroid belt before radiation
			levels become fatal.
			Warning. Radiation levels at
			three hundred millirads per
			minute and rising. Lethal
			exposure in one minute.
			Ready, Commander. I'll be
			rotating the output of the
			auxiliary reactors, but it should
			still give us the power we need.
			Proceed, Mister La Forge.
			Increasing to three-quarters
			impulse.
			Shearing force at one hundred
			three metric tons... the tractor
			beam is stable...
			Full impulse.
			Tractor beam is holding.
			Warning. Lethal radiation
			exposure in thirty seconds.
			We are in visual range of the
			asteroid belt.
			On screen.
			Warning. Lethal radiation
			exposure in fifteen seconds.
			Stand by to cut the barge loose...
			Warning. Lethal radiation
			exposure in ten seconds.
			We have cleared the asteroids,
			sir.
			Let it go.
			Radiation intensity is decreasing,
			Commander.
			Cancel red alert.
			Mister Worf, contact the mining
			settlement. Tell them we are
			joining the search for Captain
			Picard.
			Ensign, set a new course. Warp
			nine.
			Cold...
			When the sun went down, the
			temperature really dropped.
			This should help.
			... don't seem to be much good
			to you, Wesley...
			Sir... Dirgo is dead.
			I should've tried harder to stop
			him...
			Sir?
			Captain?
			Captain Picard!
			Sir... please... stay with me...
			I'm... trying...
			Captain? Remember when we took
			the shuttlecraft to Starbase
			Five-One-Five? I was dreading
			it... six hours alone with you...
			But it didn't turn out the way
			I thought it would... you kind
			of -- opened up to me. I got to
			know you.
			Sort of.
			... it's my fault you're here...
			I shouldn't have asked you...
			I was honored you wanted me
			along...
			... I was selfish... knew I might
			not see you again... forgive me...
			Sir... the past three years...
			I've lived more than most people
			do in a lifetime...
			I think I've been pretty lucky...
			no matter what happens. How many
			people get to serve with -- with
			Jean-Luc Picard?
			You don't know this... nobody
			knows this, because I never told
			anybody... but a lot of what
			I've worked for... school, and
			science projects, and getting into
			the Academy... I've done it
			because... because...
			Because I wanted you to be proud
			of me.
			One thing I learned from you...
			is that you never quit. And I'm
			not quitting now. I've seen you
			think yourself out of worse
			problems... and I'm going to
			think us out of this one.
			You're not going to die... I won't
			let you die. I'll get to the
			water and I'll keep you alive
			until they find us. I promise
			you.
			Are you certain?
			It is definitely debris. The
			primary material is duranium, with
			smaller proportions of sonodanite
			and ermanium.
			Most shuttlecraft hulls are made
			of duranium.
			Then, they're gone.
			Not necessarily, Doctor. There
			is far too little debris to
			account for an entire
			shuttlecraft.
			So what is it?
			Dirgo had his maneuvering
			thrusters rigged in a funny way...
			he claimed it was more efficient.
			If one of them blew... it might
			have left debris like that.
			If only one of his thrusters were
			out... he could still have put
			down somewhere.
			The only Class M planets in the
			system are Pentarus Two and
			Five... both have been
			thoroughly searched by the miners.
			Then, we'll search them again.
			Sir... there are also four moons
			in the Pentarus system that might
			support life...
			Have the miners searched them?
			Not yet, sir.
			What's the closest one to the
			debris coordinates?
			Lambda Paz, one of the moons of
			Pentarus Three.
			Set a course, Ensign.
			Ensign... where are we?
			We crashed, sir... we're in a
			cave...
			... need water...
			We -- we don't have any water.
			Don't you remember? We tried to
			get to the fountain... and Captain
			Dirgo...
			Yes... I remember...
			But I think I'm on to something.
			I've analyzed the sentry's
			electrical patterns.
			Wesley... I may not make it...
			I'm going to get to the water...
			I took the transponder element
			from my communicator... used it
			to modify the tricorder...
			I think I can use it to interrupt
			the sentry's energy pattern...
			stop it.
			Or at least slow it down...
			Listen to me...
			Yes, sir?
			So much I've wanted to tell you.
			At the Academy, there is
			someone... who meant a great deal
			to me... he has been there
			"forever"... you must get to know
			him... his name is Boothby... tell
			him we were friends...
			When I was there... he helped
			me... Listen to him...
			What does he teach?
			He's the groundskeeper. One of
			the wisest men I ever knew...
			I envy you, Wesley... it is just
			the beginning of the adventure
			for you.
			Go on, get the water, stay
			alive... they'll find you.
			I'll be back soon.
			Wesley...
			Always remember... I was... proud
			of you...
			It worked... !
			Captain Picard? Wake up...
			There is an intense magnetic
			field, Commander. I am getting
			an anomalous reading... but it
			is not strong enough to interpret
			accurately.
			I can narrow the frequency range
			on the sensor array... and try
			to enhance the signal...
			Any better, Data?
			Yes. The reflection signature
			now clearly indicates that it is
			metal... duranium. The probablity
			is quite high that it is the
			shuttlecraft.
			Any life signs?
			It is impossible to determine.
			The magnetic flux would mask any
			bio-energy emanations.
			Mister Worf, will that
			interference affect the
			Transporter Beam?
			Yes, Commander. An Away Team
			would have to take a
			shuttlecraft.
			Assemble your team, Mister Data.
			I'm going with you.
			Of course. Lieutenant Worf?
			Wesley?
			Mom!
			Oh, Wesley... thank God...
			I'm sure glad to see you...
			How did you find us?
			We found the wreckage -- and the
			arrow which indicated your
			direction.
			We'll take Wesley by stretcher,
			too.
			I can walk.
			Beverly...
			We're on our way back to the
			Enterprise, Captain... we've
			stabilized your vital signs.
			Mister Crusher...
			A moment...
			I want you all to know...
			He saved my life...
			Wesley, know this... you will be
			missed.
