			One.
			Worf. Are you trying to fill
			another inside straight?
			Don't say I didn't warn you.
			Pah.
			I fold.
			I will raise you three.
			No cards?
			Best poker face I've ever seen.
			Dealer takes two.
			Raise you ten.
			I will see your bet, and raise
			you twenty.
			Data. Are you sitting on a full
			house or a flush?
			It will cost you twenty to make
			that determination, Sir.
			Dealer folds.
			You two have successfully split
			the evening between yourselves.
			I suspect conspiracy. But far
			be it for me to accuse my superior
			officers.
			It's getting harder to bluff you,
			Data. You've learned this game
			well.
			Yes sir, I believe I have.
			Tell you what.
			I'll bet you I can find a card
			that you bury anywhere in this
			deck. And furthermore, I'll make
			you help me do it.
			Careful, Data.
			Your guidance is much valued,
			Counsellor. However...
			Don't let me see it.
			Now lose it in the deck.
			Cut the deck into two halves.
			Again.
			Once more.
			How many cards are left?
			Eleven.
			Pick five.
			Throw them away.
			Choose three.
			Now pick one of those.
			Turn it over.
			Is that your card?
			Incredible.
			You surreptitiously placed the
			edge of your left thumb onto the
			card immediately after I inserted
			it back into the deck. When you
			divided the deck to reshuffle,
			you kept that card on top. You
			thus were able to have me either
			discard or save depending on the
			card's location, which you
			followed at each step. Until we
			were left with one -- the card
			I originally chose.
			Sir, I think under the
			circumstances...
			Picard to Riker.
			Captain?
			We've received a distress call.
			Changing course to intercept...
			Captain's log, stardate 44215.2.
			The Enterprise has bypassed its
			scheduled archaelogical survey
			of Camus Two in response to a
			distress call from a Federation
			freighter. The Arcos has assumed
			an emergency orbit around Turkana
			Four, birthplace of our late
			comrade Tasha Yar.
			We will enter the Turkana system
			in eleven minutes, Captain.
			Engine status.
			Stable. But we have maintained
			warp factor nine for longer than
			is recommended.
			Subspace message from the Arcos.
			Their transmitter is failing, sir.
			Audio only.
			Let's hear it.
			Enterprise, this is Tan Tsu, Arcos
			engineer. Estimate five minutes
			till warp drive containment
			breach.
			Make that three minutes. Thanks
			for trying, Enterprise...
			Warp nine-point-three, Ensign.
			How much time?
			Seven minutes and fifteen seconds
			will bring us within transporter
			range.
			Go to warp nine-point-six.
			Entering the Turkana System,
			Captain.
			Mister O'Brien, prepare to lock
			onto the two crewmen.
			Aye, Captain.
			Drop to impulse.
			Visual contact.
			Get them out of there, O'Brien.
			O'Brien, status!
			There's nothing to lock onto,
			Commander.
			I am reading an ion trail
			characteristic of a freighter
			escape pod.
			Unable to establish contact.
			It could have been damaged by the
			explosion. They may have been
			incapable of maintaining orbit.
			Let's hope they stay clear of the
			colony.
			That is exactly where the ion
			trail leads, Commander.
			Hail the colony.
			I've been trying to, Captain...
			No response.
			There haven't been reliable
			communications since the
			government fell apart.
			The last Federation vessel to
			attempt contact was the Potemkin
			six years ago. They were warned
			that anyone transporting down to
			the colony would be killed.
			Ready your away team, Number One.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are in orbit above Turkana Four,
			an Earth colony that severed
			relations with the Federation
			nearly fifteen years ago. I am
			concerned about sending an away
			team, but if we are to discover
			the fate of the two missing
			Federation crewmen, I see no
			alternative.
			The surface settlement appears
			to be all but destroyed. Sensors
			show that the colonists now live
			in structures that extend nearly
			three kilometers beneath the city.
			Have you located the escape pod's
			landing point, Chief?
			Yessir... three hundred meters
			beyond the colony perimeter...
			Sir, we can anticipate a violent
			response to our presence.
			Perhaps the Doctor should wait
			here for our signal.
			I appreciate the concern. But
			I think it's exaggerated.
			Doctor, the colony is completely
			lawless. Lieutenant Yar spoke
			of rape gangs...
			Mister Worf, I can handle myself.
			She's coming. The Arcos crewmen
			may require immediate medical
			assistance.
			Phasers on maximum stun.
			Energize.
			The dispersion trail continues
			in this direction.
			The concentration gradient
			definitely increases along this
			vector.
			The escape pod was apparently
			moved into the tunnels ahead of
			us.
			Not the response we expected.
			Maybe things have changed here.
			Identify yourselves.
			We're from the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. We tracked two
			crewmen to this area. Do you know
			anything about them?
			Possibly.
			What do you mean?
			It depends on what you have to
			offer in return.
			They found us.
			Proximity detectors. I've seen
			them used on Manu Three.
			Follow me.
			Come on.
			The Alliance is holding your men
			hostage, Commander Riker, not
			us. You can expect a ransom
			demand...
			The Alliance?
			Our good friends.
			Our "good friends" are going to
			be upset when they realize we took
			their last crate of Telluridan
			synthale.
			Maybe it would be easier if I
			contacted the authorities.
			We are the "authorities."
			The Coalition -- our cadre -- runs
			this side of the city. The
			Alliance controls the other. Take
			your choice.
			Are you offering to help?
			In return for some...
			consideration. Phasers are in
			short supply down here. A
			starship isn't going to miss a
			few.
			That is no better than a ransom
			demand.
			No matter what you give the
			Alliance, they'll eventually kill
			your crewmen anyway. With our
			help there's at least a chance
			you'll get them back alive.
			All we're asking for is help in
			maintaining our defense. We're
			trying to keep the peace.
			Everything we've seen suggests
			otherwise.
			A prank. The proximity implants
			prevent either side from doing
			any serious damage.
			They warn us when an enemy is
			approaching.
			Then why do you need more phasers?
			The Alliance just discovered a
			large cache of weapons. I just
			want to make things even.
			Preserve the peace.
			You keep using the word "peace."
			We've heard a different version
			of life on Turkana Four.
			Ancient history.
			Where did you hear that?
			A former crewmember was born here.
			Where's he now?
			She was killed in the line of
			duty.
			That's as good a way to die as
			any.
			As I said -- ancient history.
			This is now. And your men are
			in trouble.
			We'll return to the Enterprise
			and consider your proposal.
			A gift for your Captain.
			Riker to Enterprise. Energize.
			I want everything there is to
			know about the starship
			Enterprise.
			According to Hayne, the Coalition
			and the Alliance raid each other
			for supplies -- much of it
			non-essential.
			Why?
			A battle exercise.
			Their defenses apparently prevent
			deep strikes into each other's
			territory. Minor skirmishes are
			all that's left.
			"Coalition", "Alliance" -- it all
			sounds so reasonable. But you've
			described the behavior of urban
			street thugs. We certainly won't
			trade weapons for the crewmen.
			How do you suggest we deal with
			them?
			We have to tell them something.
			No promises. No denials.
			For now, Hayne's Coalition is our
			only safe access to the colony.
			Let's keep the door open and see
			where it leads.
			Captain. Transmission from
			Turkana Four. Coming in on a
			secure channel.
			On screen.
			Hello, Enterprise. Commander
			Riker, would you introduce me to
			your Captain?
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
			I have someone here you might like
			to meet.
			This is Ishara... Ishara Yar.
			Tasha was my sister.
			There's an old saying, Captain.
			"The enemy of my enemy is my
			friend." I've decided it's in
			my best interest to help you get
			your men back.
			With nothing from us in return?
			You could be forced into paying
			my adversary a ransom in weapons.
			I'll do anything I can to avoid
			that possibility.
			What do you propose?
			Ishara will be our liaison.
			I know Alliance territory. I can
			help you with a rescue plan.
			One moment.
			Mute.
			Reactions?
			I do not trust him.
			She could be a fake. We mentioned
			that a former member of the crew
			had come from the colony.
			All Hayne had to do was search
			through whatever their database
			had on Starfleet to come up with
			Tasha's name.
			Counsellor?
			He's being deceptive, and he's
			clearly hoping to manipulate us.
			As for the young woman's identity,
			I can't tell.
			Regardless, this is an option we
			cannot neglect. We'll continue
			on other fronts as they present
			themselves. For now, let's see
			what she has to say.
			Open.
			I've decided to accept your
			proposal.
			Thank you.
			Good luck.
			Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara.
			I am Commander Data.
			You're not human.
			I am an android.
			Built for fighting... ?
			On what do you base that
			assumption?
			A cybernetic device serving on
			a starship...
			The Enterprise is not a ship of
			war. It is a ship of
			exploration.
			The first thing to do is help you
			map the colony.
			This is a general grid of the
			tunnel systems. I can fill in
			the specific details from memory.
			My orders are to escort you to
			the Observation Lounge. We will
			proceed from there.
			Your sister never spoke of you.
			That's not surprising.
			It is surprising to me. Tasha
			and I spent much time together
			in the course of our duties. We
			had a considerable number of
			conversations.
			Did she talk at all about the
			colony?
			Only to say that she was lucky
			to have escaped.
			It wasn't luck. It was cowardice.
			"Cowardice" is a term that I have
			never heard applied to Tasha.
			Is something wrong?
			No. It is just that for a
			moment, the expression on your
			face was reminiscent of your
			sister.
			It's been fifteen years. I don't
			even remember what she looked
			like...
			You don't believe I'm Tasha's
			sister.
			We have considered that
			possibility.
			I'm not surprised. You can
			sample my DNA if you like.
			Thank you, I will.
			Please. Sit down.
			Perhaps it would help if you gave
			us some idea of what we're dealing
			with on Turkana Four. Our last
			information describes a colony
			in complete disarray.
			It started falling apart almost
			thirty years ago. There were
			dozens of factions. They fought
			until the city above ground was
			in ruins.
			The Coalition and the Alliance
			are all that's left?
			We were the two strongest
			factions... When the government
			couldn't stop the violence, they
			gave us police powers. The
			proximity detectors were
			originally designed by the
			government to keep us under
			control.
			Apparently, that part of the plan
			didn't succeed very well.
			No. After a few months, we
			didn't need the government any
			more.
			Tasha left you in the middle of
			all that?
			She didn't abandon me, if that's
			what you mean. Tasha asked me
			to go with her. But I had
			already joined the Coalition.
			They were my family.
			Captain, we don't have a lot of
			time. Maybe we should get
			started.
			Incoming transmission from the
			colony, Captain.
			On screen.
			Enterprise, I'm being held by the
			Turkana Four Alliance. I've been
			instructed to say that you have
			twenty hours to make reparations
			for Federation intrusion into this
			colony.
			Or my pilot and I will be killed.
			Ask them if we can at least send
			a medical --
			Take that threat seriously,
			Captain. They'll torture them
			and then they'll kill them. My
			cadre has never recovered a
			hostage alive from the Alliance.
			Your crewmen could be held in any
			number of places. The Alliance
			has two main headquarters and
			thirteen ancillary bases of
			operation. All underground. All
			heavily guarded.
			If I could get to the myographic
			scanner...
			What's that?
			A sensing device on the escape
			pod. It monitors the bio-electric
			signatures of the crew. In the
			event they get separated from the
			pod.
			I could install a booster on the
			device that would relay its
			signals to the Enterprise. Then
			we could track the men from up
			here.
			Unfortunately, we don't know where
			the escape pod is.
			Level Three-C, Section
			five-four-seven.
			We have our sources.
			Access tunnels are here...
			... and here.
			We could transport an away team
			right into this intersection...
			Don't underestimate them,
			Commander. They'll be ready for
			that... I've seen them use this
			kind of strategy before.
			I know it looks isolated and
			easily accessible... But my guess
			is they have hundreds of men on
			the levels above and below
			waiting for you to make your
			move.
			We'll need a diversion.
			Transport a couple of photon
			grenades into the adjoining
			chambers. At minimum intensity
			it wouldn't kill anybody, just
			shake them up a lot.
			That won't give us enough time.
			We need something that'll occupy
			them long enough for you to
			install the relay.
			Transport me into this corridor.
			My magnetic implant will set off
			the defense alarms. They'll
			think it's a raid by the
			Coalition.
			Too dangerous. We've seen what
			those tunnels look like. You
			could easily be cut off from the
			rest of us.
			Worf, if we --
			-- Commander Riker.
			I was ordered to assist you in
			any way possible. That doesn't
			mean "as long as it's safe, or
			convenient."
			If you had the time, we could come
			up with another plan.
			But you don't. Right now, I'm
			your best option.
			She would have to be armed,
			Commander.
			I want to discuss this with the
			Captain.
			Mister Data, take Ishara to see
			Doctor Crusher.
			You have Tasha's DNA on file?
			The ship's computer does.
			There's always some
			differentiation in the somatic
			chromosomes -- but it's not enough
			to affect the results.
			It'll take me a few hours to run
			the isomorphic comparison.
			That wasn't too bad.
			So, all that's left of my sister
			is a file in a computer...
			Tasha exists in our memories as
			well.
			How did she die?
			Lieutenant Yar was killed on Vagra
			Two by a malevolent entity.
			In battle?
			No... she was killed as a
			demonstration of the creature's
			power. Without provocation.
			That's not how I intend to die.
			The Captain approves. You're
			with us.
			Enterprise, we're in position.
			Damn!
			Geordi -- what's taking so long?
			There's a lot of damage here...
			The myographic scanner is
			operational, but the power source
			is fluctuating.
			Can you fix it?
			I can try to run a shunt from the
			convertor.
			How long will that take?
			Ten minutes?
			Do it.
			O'Brien! Lock onto Ishara and
			get her out of here!
			There's a transformer substation
			directly above the chamber she
			just entered. It's masking her
			signal.
			Standby!
			Stay here and cover La Forge.
			Commander --
			That's an order. Return to the
			ship when you're finished here.
			I'll signal for transport as soon
			as I can.
			Energize!
			Come.
			How is she?
			A couple of cracked ribs, but
			she'll be all right.
			Doctor Crusher just called me with
			the results of her DNA comparison.
			Ishara is Tasha's sister.
			After what she did for us down
			there, I wouldn't doubt that for
			a minute.
			You took some unnecessary personal
			risks, Number One.
			We lost Tasha on an away mission,
			under my command. The thought
			of the same thing happening to
			her sister...
			That's an emotional response,
			Will. We can't afford that.
			Understood, Captain.
			Commander...
			Well done.
			I've fused the bone tissue along
			both fractures.
			The muscles around the area will
			be weak for a day or so -- but
			you shouldn't feel any pain.
			I wanted to thank you personally
			for what you did for us down at
			the colony. It was... more than
			I expected.
			I don't run away when things get
			tough, like some people do...
			like my sister did...
			Let me tell you about your sister.
			The first time I met Tasha Yar,
			she was making her way through
			a Carnelian mine field to reach
			a wounded colonist.
			Her ship had responded to their
			distress call, as had mine. When
			it was all over, I requested that
			Tasha be assigned to the
			Enterprise.
			Her ship's captain owed me a
			favor.
			In the months that followed, Tasha
			never once failed to put the
			safety of the crew before her own.
			She died doing the same.
			I'm sorry you never knew the woman
			Tasha became. I think you might
			have been proud of her.
			And she of you.
			What is this structure?
			A main fusion source -- there's
			one next to each of the Alliance
			headquarters. It powers all their
			defensive systems.
			This chamber is accessed from the
			level below. Entry points are
			evenly spaced along this wall
			every twenty-five meters.
			Data... Where was Tasha's post?
			The Tactical Station -- where
			Lieutenant Worf is now.
			Did Tasha have many friends here?
			Yes. She was especially close
			to Commander Riker and Lieutenant
			Worf. And to myself.
			Are you able to have friends?
			Yes.
			But you don't have feelings, do
			you?
			Not as such. However, perhaps
			even among humans, friendship is
			sometimes less an emotional
			response, and more a sense of
			familiarity.
			You can become used to someone.
			Exactly. As I experience certain
			sensory input patterns, my mental
			pathways become accustomed to
			them. The inputs eventually are
			anticipated. And even "missed"
			when absent. When something once
			expected is no longer there.
			Like my sister.
			Yes. Like your sister.
			They've been moved so far
			underground that it took awhile
			to pinpoint their signatures.
			The men are here. Next to one
			of the Alliance headquarters.
			And that's about two kilometers
			of solid granite above them.
			So much for the transporter.
			Not necessarily. We could use
			the ship's phasers to cut a shaft
			through the bedrock to this
			storage tunnel here.
			With a clear path through the
			rock, we'd be able to transport
			down to the tunnel. That would
			put us close enough to get to the
			crewmen.
			It would take me a few hours to
			adjust the phasers for drilling.
			It's a maze around there...
			I spent a lot of time in that
			section before they took it over.
			There are blind tunnels and dead
			ends that don't even show up on
			this map.
			We don't have much choice.
			If it wasn't for my implant
			setting off all the alarms, I
			could guide you to your men.
			We could remove the implant.
			It has a micro-explosive inside
			that detonates on contact with
			air. When you join a cadre, you
			join for life.
			A small force field containing
			xenon or another inert gas could
			be placed over the incision site.
			The explosive could thereby be
			safely disarmed at the same time
			it is removed.
			It's more than just a tactical
			device to you, isn't it? It's
			part of your identity.
			This is something you'll have to
			decide for yourself, Ishara.
			Think about it while we're waiting
			for Geordi.
			Our parents were killed in some
			crossfire just after I was born.
			Some people took care of us for
			a few months... Then one day we
			came home and they were gone.
			So Tasha took care of me. And
			when I got old enough, I joined
			the Coalition.
			And Tasha did not?
			My sister hated the cadres.
			Blamed them for our parents death.
			For everything. She refused to
			join. And she left as soon as
			she had the chance.
			I always thought she was weak for
			doing that...
			But maybe I was wrong. Maybe
			she made the right choice.
			To work together for something
			besides killing... to be close
			to someone without having to
			protect your back.
			You find that appealing?
			Very appealing. You're a perfect
			example. I hardly even know you
			Data, but already I completely
			trust you. I even consider you
			my friend.
			Thank you. I would like to
			consider you my friend, Ishara.
			If I had known about this place
			fifteen years ago, things might've
			been different.
			Maybe it's not too late.
			Ishara is willing to have the
			implant removed.
			Very good. You may inform Doctor
			Crusher.
			She also expressed a desire to
			leave the colony. She hopes
			to apply to the Academy and
			eventually join Starfleet.
			Does she understand the magnitude
			of these decisions?
			She claims to, Captain.
			Her courage certainly speaks in
			her favor. But Ishara's personal
			history concerns me.
			Did her sister not come from the
			very same environment, Sir?
			Tasha never joined one of these
			gangs. Doesn't that suggest a
			fundamental difference between
			the two of them?
			I do not know. But I do know that
			often for humans, decisions made
			in youth only hold true for youth.
			I get a sense of ambiguity from
			her. Her loyalties are clearly
			divided, Captain, no matter what
			she may say.
			Are you suggesting we deny her
			an escape from this environment,
			Counselor?
			No... I'm just not convinced she
			really wants to escape. It is
			the only way of life she's ever
			known.
			Ultimately, it is her decision
			to make, not ours...
			Certainly nothing would please
			me more than to see another
			officer named Yar in the service
			of Starfleet... Mister Data,
			proceed with the rescue as
			discussed...
			Data?
			Yes, Counselor?
			You seem so strong in your
			support. I'm curious...
			We must free the crewmen. She
			appears to be our best hope of
			doing so. Also, individuals
			worthy of Starfleet training are
			somewhat rare.
			In addition...
			I have become used to her.
			Thank you, Data.
			You are welcome. Doctor Crusher
			is expecting you in Sickbay.
			It's all so different...
			To what are you referring?
			On the colony, nobody does
			anything for anyone else unless
			they have something to gain from
			it.
			But I do have something to gain.
			Your continued presence on this
			ship.
			Is something wrong?
			I have to tell Hayne and the
			others. I owe it to them.
			Guess I ought to get it over with.
			If you desire privacy, you may
			use the observation lounge.
			That would probably make things
			a little easier.
			Report?
			It's working.
			Captain's log, stardate 44225.3.
			Doctor Crusher has removed
			Ishara's magnetic implant,
			enabling the young woman to guide
			our rescue attempt.
			Without my intending it, she has
			virtually become an active member
			of the crew.
			Cardiovascular functions normal.
			Metabolism, immunity, all other
			vital signs excellent.
			How do you feel?
			Better than I've ever felt.
			Thanks for staying with me.
			You might want this... It was
			a part of your life for a long
			time.
			You keep it, Data. So you won't
			forget me.
			Have you reconsidered your
			decision to stay with us?
			Just in case something goes wrong
			down there...
			I understand you wish to join
			Starfleet.
			Someday... If I'm lucky.
			On that day, it is we who will
			be "lucky."
			Picard to Riker. Is your away
			team ready?
			Waiting for your signal, Captain.
			Status, Mister La Forge.
			Phasers in alignment and ready
			to fire.
			How far must we penetrate to
			safely allow transporter function?
			One point six kilometers.
			Fire phasers.
			Aye, Sir.
			One point three kilometers. One
			point four. One point five. One
			point six.
			Deep enough for transport, Sir.
			Cease fire.
			Picard to O'Brien, Energize.
			This way.
			Caution is indicated.
			We're near the heart of the
			Alliance. Security is minimal
			here. They aren't expecting
			anybody this far in.
			Ishara?
			Follow me.
			Are you certain?
			No, I'm not.
			I was here. But it was a long
			time ago. I'm trying to remember...
			there have been changes...
			It's through here.
			Your men are behind that door.
			Hold out your hands.
			Let's get moving.
			Where is she?
			Commander, look.
			What the hell happened here?
			She probably tried to draw their
			fire. It triggered the alarm.
			Worf, get these men back to the
			Enterprise.
			Data, you're with me. She can't
			be far.
			Ishara.
			What are you doing?
			The fusion generator is
			overloading.
			You are attempting to disable the
			defense system. For what reason?
			We have rescued the crewmen.
			I don't care about your crewmen.
			We have three thousand troops
			waiting at the perimeter. When
			the defenses go down, they'll come
			in. The Alliance will fall.
			The Federation will be responsible
			for the resulting deaths. I
			cannot allow that.
			You don't have a choice.
			That is not true.
			I don't want to kill you, Data.
			But I will.
			We will both be destroyed in the
			explosion.
			The Coalition's been all I've
			had for fifteen years. They've
			given me a life. I don't mind
			dying for them.
			But you won't have to if you get
			out of here right now.
			Was this your intention from the
			beginning?
			We never could have gotten this
			deep into Alliance territory
			without your help.
			Our help was not deliberate. You
			deceived us.
			What's the difference? You got
			what you came for. Why should
			you care about what we do?
			Your friendship with me was part
			of the deception, was it not?
			You misled me at each step. And
			yet I was completely unaware.
			That doesn't matter now! None
			of it does!
			Get out of here, Data. Please.
			Now.
			My duty requires me to intercede.
			Stop...
			Ishara!
			What was she doing?
			Disabling the detection system
			so her forces could attack.
			Set to kill.
			The Captain wants to see you on
			the bridge.
			What's going to happen to me?
			That is Captain Picard's decision.
			If the captain were Klingon, you
			would be executed.
			Sometimes a warrior must use
			deception in the service of her
			cause.
			If anyone on this ship should know
			that, it's you.
			Such a warrior must also be
			prepared to suffer the
			consequences.
			Your strategy failed.
			It was a calculated risk. You
			gave us an opportunity we couldn't
			ignore.
			Are you hurt, Ishara?
			No.
			I want her returned immediately.
			You're not in a position to
			dictate to anybody. She attacked
			two Federation officers.
			You have no jurisdiction here!
			Don't talk about legal rights.
			Your jurisdiction is based
			entirely on the threat of
			violence.
			You have your crewmen back. Isn't
			that enough?
			Commander Data, escort Ishara to
			the transporter toom.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Close the channel.
			You're far more charitable than
			I would have been, Captain.
			I understand your feelings, Number
			One. I share them. But perhaps
			the fault lies in ourselves. We
			were so eager to embrace her.
			Each of us, myself included,
			wanted to see something of Tasha
			in her sister. We saw more than
			what was there.
			You haven't said one word to me.
			What do you wish to talk about?
			I did what I had to. I'm sorry
			if I hurt you in the process.
			I am an android. It is not
			possible for me to be injured
			in that fashion.
			Whenever you're ready.
			You know, I wasn't always lying
			to you, Data. The time we spent
			talking... it was the closest
			thing to friendship I've ever had.
			If that means anything to you.
			Energize.
			Come in.
			Data. Come in, come in.
			Commander.
			What's on your mind?
			Recent events have left me
			puzzled, Sir.
			It has been days since Ishara
			left. And yet, my thoughts seem
			to dwell on her. Almost as if
			I were experiencing a feedback
			loop in my mnemonic network.
			I know what you mean.
			It is curious that I was so easily
			misled.
			Make that "we."
			Yes sir.
			Data, in every trust is the
			possibility of betrayal. I don't
			think you were prepared for that.
			Were you prepared?
			I'm not sure anybody ever is.
			Then is it better not to trust?
			Without trust, there can be no
			friendship, no closeness. None
			of the emotional bonds that make
			us what we are.
			And yet you put yourself at risk.
			Every single time. Love itself
			is a leap of faith.
			So, a prerequisite for love is
			accepting the risk of betrayal.
			That's an interesting point of
			view, Data. Maybe you're right.
			The emotions we experience when
			someone we believe in turns away
			-- they're the most painful a
			person can feel.
			We believed in her, Data...
			Yes. Perhaps I am fortunate to
			be spared the emotional
			consequences.
			Perhaps...
