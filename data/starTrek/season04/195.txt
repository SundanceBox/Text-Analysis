			Captain's Log, Stardate 44769.2.
			For some weeks we have had a
			Klingon exo-biologist on board
			as part of a scientific exchange
			program. Unfortunately, we
			suspect that he may have been
			involved not only in a security
			breach but in the possible
			sabotage of our warp drive.
			What were you doing accessing
			the propulsion system files on
			Stardate 44758?
			I didn't...
			But you did... from computer
			Twelve-B-Nine on Deck Thirty-six.
			The computer logged in your
			identification from your
			communicator.
			It must be a mistake.
			J'Dan... we have confirmed
			reports that schematic drawings
			of our dilithium chamber fell
			into Romulan hands... one week
			later.
			I know nothing about it.
			And you don't know anything about
			the explosion that disabled the
			warp drive at almost the same
			time?
			No. I was not involved. You
			accuse me because I am Klingon.
			Our Chief Security Officer is
			Klingon, J'Dan -- that has
			nothing to do with it.
			Send me home, then, if you are
			so distrusting.
			We've discussed that with the
			Klingon High Council. You'll be
			sent back... as soon as we've
			finished our investigation.
			I have nothing more to say.
			Very well. Mister Worf... please
			accompany the Lieutenant to his
			quarters.
			What do you think?
			It's hard to tell. He is very
			closed... but...
			He is hiding something.
			On the Klingon Home World... your
			name is not mentioned... it is
			as though you never existed.
			A terrible burden for a warrior
			to bear... to become nothing...
			without honor... without the
			chance for glory...
			I have friends... powerful
			friends... on the Home World.
			I could talk to them... they might
			help to restore your name...
			If you could just take me to a
			shuttlecraft...
			It could be done without any one
			knowing --
			I do not know how you managed to
			transfer secret information to the
			Romulans... but I will find out.
			Pahtak -- !
			And when we inform the Klingon
			High Council, they will put you to
			a slow death.
			Retired Admiral Norah Satie,
			whose investigation exposed the
			alien conspiracy against Starfleet
			Command three years ago, is
			arriving to assist in our
			investigation.
			Captain Picard...
			Admiral Satie. Welcome to the
			Enterprise.
			I am delighted to be here.
			I've managed to acquire my former
			staff... My aide, Sabin Genestra,
			from Betazed, and my assistant,
			Nellen Tore, from Delb Two.
			And my First Officer, Commander
			William Riker. May I show you
			to your quarters?
			Captain... if Starfleet Command
			is so concerned with your report
			that they brought me out of
			retirement... I think I should
			get right to work.
			Very well... Commander, will you
			see to the Admiral's Staff?
			First, I'd like to inspect the
			damage to your Engine Room.
			We still can't get in there,
			Captain. The radiation levels
			are dropping, but they're too high
			to raise the isolation door.
			How much longer will it be?
			At the rate the levels have been
			decreasing, we will be able to
			gain entry in forty-nine hours.
			Maybe the Admiral would like to
			see the visual log of the
			explosion.
			This was logged four days ago...
			at oh-three hundred hours.
			At that point the emergency
			confinement field was activated
			and the isolation doors came
			down. No one was killed, but
			two of my people are in Sickbay
			with radiation burns.
			Have you been able to make any
			preliminary assessments?
			A slow-motion study of the
			explosion suggests that the
			articulation frame collapsed.
			The schematics that were stolen
			from the Enterprise... I believe
			some involved the articulation
			frame of the dilithium chamber...
			That is one reason we tend to
			suspect sabotage.
			Other evidence lends credence to
			that theory, Captain. A review
			of the sensor logs indicates that
			every systems reading was well
			within normal parameters until
			fifty-two milliseconds before the
			explosion.
			We haven't found anything that
			suggests there was a malfunction
			anywhere along the line.
			Captain Picard... I think I need
			a full briefing before we go any
			further.
			Commander Data... La Forge... I'll
			admit I'm glad I don't have to
			do your job... good luck.
			Excuse me, Doctor...
			Yes, Lieutenant?
			When you have a moment... I must
			ask you something...
			Good timing. I'm finished here...
			Mister Tarses... ?
			Please enter these readings into
			Ensign Dagget's file.
			Yes, Doctor.
			What is it, Worf?
			Did you issue this to J'Dan?
			Looks like a micro-replicating
			hyposyringe... but it's not
			Starfleet issue...
			It was found... in his quarters.
			J'Dan has Ba'ltmasor Syndrome...
			he comes in regularly for
			treatments... but we use our
			own hyposprays. Is this one
			Klingon?
			Yes. Do you know what this
			attachment is?
			No... it's nothing we use...
			Thank you, Doctor.
			I hope that helps.
			You've told me exactly what I
			wanted to hear.
			There are disturbing overtones...
			to the idea of a Klingon providing
			information to the Romulans...
			Are you... aware... of any other
			Romulan-Klingon connections that
			Starfleet Command might have
			encountered recently?
			I don't believe... what Starfleet
			Command knows or doesn't know is
			for me to reveal.
			This ship has had several
			encounters which might suggest
			a potential alliance between those
			two powers --
			We're aware of that, Captain.
			What we must concentrate on is
			the business at hand.
			Come.
			Excuse me, Captain, I didn't know
			--
			Please come in Mister Worf. I
			particularly want our guest to
			meet you... Admiral Satie...
			my head of security, Lieutenant
			Worf.
			Captain... I have been pursuing
			the investigation of Lieutenant
			J'Dan. I believe I know how
			he transferred information off
			the Enterprise.
			Good work, Lieutenant.
			This is J'Dan's. It is fitted
			with an optical reader...
			specially modified to read data
			from Starfleet isolinear chips.
			He can extract digital information
			from a computer... encode it in
			the form of amino-acid sequences,
			and transfer those sequences into
			a fluid in the syringe... Then
			he injects someone, perhaps even
			without their knowledge...
			Or perhaps with their knowledge...
			The information would be carried
			in their bloodstream in the form
			of inert proteins.
			The body itself becomes a conveyor
			of top-secret files...
			Lieutenant Worf... when we
			confront J'Dan, I want you to
			conduct the interrogation.
			I would be honored.
			Captain... I predict that officer
			will be extremely valuable in this
			investigation.
			I tracked the movements of each
			person who left the Enterprise
			since you've been here. I traced
			one Tarkanian diplomat as far as
			the Cruces system... where he
			disappeared and has not been seen
			since.
			That proves nothing.
			This was found in your quarters.
			I take injections. Everyone knows
			that.
			But your injections don't require
			an optical chip reader. This
			device --
			-- has only one function: to
			transform computer information
			into biological sequences.
			The blood of all Klingons has
			become water... since the
			Federation alliance we have
			become a nation of mewling
			babies... The Romulans are
			strong... they are worthy
			allies... they do not turn
			Klingons into weaklings --
			-- like you...
			How did you damage the dilithium
			chamber?
			I had nothing to do with that --
			No? You mean it was sheer
			coincidence that it was sabotaged
			after you gave the plans for its
			design to the Romulans?
			I do not know. I had nothing to
			do with it.
			You've admitted your crime. Why
			lie now?
			I am not lying.
			You may have him confined, Mister
			Worf.
			Sabin?
			I believe... he is telling the
			truth.
			He admits stealing the files...
			but not sabotaging the dilithium
			chamber. I get no sense that he
			is lying.
			If you're right... someone else
			may be involved.
			I think, Captain... that you have
			a bigger problem on your ship than
			one Klingon Exchange Officer.
			I've seen this before. The
			spectre of conspiracy on a
			starship is a frightening one.
			It's hard for me to believe...
			but I am grateful for your
			presence, Admiral. If anyone in
			Starfleet can help us, it's you.
			Captain Picard... I find myself
			changing my mind about you...
			In what way... ?
			When Starfleet ordered me here...
			it was with the express command
			that we work together on this
			problem... as equals...
			My father taught me to avoid
			partnerships... most of them are
			woefully lop-sided.
			That sounds like Judge Aaron
			Satie...
			You knew my father?
			Through his writing. His judicial
			decisions were required reading
			at the Academy.
			He was an extraordinary man.
			Every night at the dinner table...
			he'd pose a question for debate.
			My big brothers and I would
			wrangle it around, from one side
			and the other... my father would
			referee... he kept a stopwatch
			on us so we'd have to learn
			brevity... and he wouldn't let
			us leave until he thought we had
			completely explored the issue...
			I'm willing to wager you trounced
			your brothers in those debates...
			More than once. Father would love
			it when I nailed one of them on
			some subtle point of logic...
			All that I am, I owe to him. He
			was... a giant...
			You must miss him very much.
			I like your Mister Worf. Very
			direct, to the point. The two
			of you make a good combination.
			Captain... I've always preferred
			working alone.
			That way, if something goes wrong,
			I don't have to look far for the
			cause.
			I resented your being assigned
			to me. But... I was wrong. We're
			going to make quite a team.
			J'Dan did not make friends
			easily... there are not many to
			question...
			You've done a thorough job,
			Lieutenant.
			I am strongly motivated in this
			matter.
			Yes. I can see that. And I don't
			mind telling you I'm surprised.
			Frankly, when I first heard about
			your father...
			My father...
			...yes... There are some who
			believe he betrayed your people
			to the Romulans...
			My father... what he did or did
			not do... is no one's concern but
			my own...
			Of course. Of course. I only
			meant... before I saw you in
			action, I naturally considered
			you a possible security risk...
			but I want you to know you have
			the Admiral's and my complete
			confidence. You have nothing to
			prove to us.
			If there is a conspiracy on board,
			I promise you I will find it...
			Good. You know the ship, you know
			the personnel... you know exactly
			what we're up against... we're
			counting on you, Lieutenant.
			I will arrange for the interviews
			to begin.
			And how often did Lieutenant
			J'Dan come in for injections?
			About once a week.
			Did you administer them yourself?
			No. One of my assistants did
			that...
			Did you ever hear him say
			anything... anything that might
			have seemed innocent at the
			time... that might now shed any
			light on this investigation?
			No, nothing. In fact, he rarely
			talked at all.
			Thank you, Doctor Crusher, we
			appreciate your time. You are
			excused now. Mister Worf, will
			you bring in the next person?
			Please sit down, Mister Tarses.
			For the record, will you state
			your name and position?
			Simon Tarses, Crewman First Class,
			medical technician.
			I assure you this is an informal
			inquiry... we're not accusing you
			of anything. However, if you want
			counsel, it will be provided for
			you.
			No, sir... I have nothing to hide.
			Very well. How long have you held
			your appointment on the
			Enterprise?
			Since... Stardate 43587.
			Eight-eight...
			Mister Tarses... your records
			state that you were born on Mars
			Colony...
			That's right.
			Then you are human?
			Largely. My paternal grandfather
			was Vulcan.
			Yes, I see that here. Tell me...
			what is your relationship to the
			Klingon, J'Dan?
			I... he... I mean, there's no
			relationship... he just came in
			for his injections...
			Did you give him those injections?
			Sometimes. There were several
			of us, actually... I might have
			done it twice...
			Did you ever hear him make any
			comments that might, in
			retrospect, be suspicious?
			Not really. He hardly talked.
			Did you ever see him outside
			Sickbay?
			Once or twice in Ten-Forward...
			with a group of people. I never
			had a conversation with him.
			Very well, Mister Tarses. I don't
			think there's need for more...
			Captain?
			You're excused, Crewman.
			Mister Worf...
			Wait.
			He's lying.
			He's desperately frightened...
			he's covering something.
			It was clear he was frightened,
			but that's hardly an indication
			--
			It's more than that. He wasn't
			truthful. He's covering a lie...
			one so big it's overwhelming him.
			I think we've found the man.
			I'm not sure I can sanction any
			action against Mister Tarses based
			solely on Betazoid intuitions.
			Sabin has uncanny instincts. I've
			learned to trust them.
			I must admit... that I'm a bit
			uneasy with this use of a
			Betazoid.
			You have a Betazoid counselor...
			surely you are aware of the
			advantages.
			There is a difference between a
			counselor... and an investigator.
			Are you saying you never use your
			counselor during interrogations?
			I do... but I don't act on the
			basis of her instincts alone.
			Nor do I.
			You're asking me to restrict
			Tarses' movements -- based on
			Sabin's "feeling."
			If Counselor Troi suggested to
			you... that someone on the ship
			were dangerous... would you not
			act on that? Observe him... curb
			his activity?
			I have to admit I probably would.
			And maybe I should re-evaluate
			that behavior.
			Nonsense. Let's keep our
			priorities straight... the
			important thing is to uncover the
			conspiracy on this ship... and
			to prevent further damage. If
			Tarses is a possible saboteur,
			you cannot allow him access to
			the sensitive areas of the ship.
			And... I strongly suggest
			continuous surveillance.
			If we had better evidence...
			We will have better evidence...
			Sabin and Worf are continuing to
			investigate... but if you don't
			act until then... it may be too
			late.
			No. I won't treat a man as a
			criminal unless there is probable
			cause to do so.
			And while you're being so
			generous... you give a saboteur
			the chance to strike again.
			Last time it was just a hatch
			cover... what if next time it's
			more serious? What if lives are
			lost? Can you afford not to act?
			Engineering to Captain Picard...
			Yes, Mister La Forge...
			Sir, could you come to Engineering
			right away? We've got something
			interesting to show you.
			We'll be right there.
			We finally got in here about six
			hours ago, and we've been going
			over it inch by inch ever since.
			We have made micro-tomographic
			analyses of the dilithium
			chamber... the hatch mounting...
			the blast pattern from the
			explosion...
			We did mass spectrometer readings
			of the residue for chemical
			content... sifted the debris for
			bomb fragments...
			And what did you find?
			See the frame for the hatch... ?
			It ruptured --
			-- right there. And when we take
			a reading of that spot...
			See?
			I'm afraid I'm out of my element
			here, Commander. You'll have to
			interpret for me.
			There are sub-micron fractures
			in the metal casing...
			That's right. A breakdown in the
			atomic cohesive structure.
			Yes... ? And what caused them?
			Those fractures suggest nothing
			more than simple neutron fatigue.
			I would speculate that when the
			engine was last inspected at
			McKinley station, the hatch casing
			was replaced with one which had
			an undetectable defect.
			I think, sir, that the conclusion
			of our investigation must be that
			the explosion was not
			intentional.
			That's the way I see it. This
			wasn't sabotage at all... it was
			nothing more than an accident.
			An accident? I find that hard
			to believe...
			If my men say there was no
			sabotage, you can be sure there
			was none.
			Let's keep our perspective,
			gentlemen. Just because there
			was no sabotage doesn't mean
			there's not a conspiracy on this
			ship. We do have a confessed spy.
			And he had confederates.
			Do we know that for sure?
			Of course he did.
			Do you think J'Dan could have
			come on board the flagship of the
			Federation and done all that he
			did without help?
			It would be difficult... but not
			impossible...
			We must continue to investigate
			Tarses. He was hiding something.
			Captain Picard... Lieutenant Worf
			and I are working well together.
			I suggest we continue... if for
			no other purpose than to determine
			Tarses' innocence.
			I remind you all... that Tarses
			is innocent... until he is proven
			guilty.
			Of course he is. What Sabin is
			saying is that he and Lieutenant
			Worf would like to establish
			Tarses' innocence
			unequivocally... for his own sake.
			Very well. But I hope we can put
			the matter to rest as quickly as
			possible.
			You've opened the hearing to
			spectators?
			It isn't good to have closed-door
			proceedings for too long... it
			invites rumor and speculation.
			Besides... spies and saboteurs
			don't like the bright light of
			public inquiry. They're like
			roaches, scuttling for the dark
			corners...
			This hearing is convened on
			Stardate 44740 as a continuing
			inquiry into the activities of
			Crewman Simon Tarses.
			Mister Tarses... for your own
			protection, I have assigned you
			counsel in the person of Commander
			William Riker.
			Begging your pardon, sir... I
			appreciate it, but... I don't need
			protection. I haven't done
			anything wrong.
			With the Captain's permission,
			I would like to make a statement.
			This is irregular. Let's stick
			to procedure, here.
			It's not irregular to have a
			statement read into the record.
			This is a hearing, not a trial.
			Doctor, you may come forward.
			Thank you. I would like to go
			on record as saying that I have
			worked with Crewman Tarses for
			eighteen months. His work has
			been exemplary. He is a model
			of diligence and reliability.
			He is devoted to Starfleet and
			as far as I'm concerned, his
			loyalty is without question.
			There's no way this man is a
			traitor.
			Thank you for letting me speak.
			Doctor Crusher...
			Did you ever observe Crewman
			Tarses with J'Dan...
			Well, yes... he came in for
			injections --
			I mean outside Sickbay.
			I mean outside Sickbay.
			I think so... maybe in
			Ten-Forward...
			And whom else did you observe at
			these occasions, Doctor?
			I don't see what relevance that
			has here -- it was an innocent
			social gathering...
			If it was innocent, why would you
			hesitate to give us the names?
			Thank you, Doctor Crusher. You
			are excused.
			Admiral Satie... if you have a
			case to make against Tarses, you
			had better make it. Or I am
			calling this off here and now.
			Mister Tarses. Isn't it true that
			you have had access to the
			biological supplies in Sickbay?
			That's part of my job, yes.
			J'Dan used deoxyribose
			suspensions to carry the encoded
			files he stole. Isn't it true
			that one of your duties is to
			prepare those suspensions?
			Several technicians share that
			job...
			And isn't it true that your
			security clearance gives you
			access to all the stores and files
			in Sickbay -- access which you
			can exercise at any time?
			Because I have access doesn't mean
			I --
			What would you say if I told you
			there is evidence that the
			explosion in the engine room
			was caused by a corrosive
			chemical... one that is kept
			stored in Sickbay.
			I had nothing to do with it --
			How can we believe you? How can
			we possibly believe someone whom
			we know... we know... to be a
			liar?
			I object, sir... There is no
			basis for calling Officer Tarses
			a liar.
			Agreed. Mister Sabin...
			Captain, there is a basis which
			will be clear in a moment.
			Mister Tarses, isn't it true that
			you deliberately and
			premeditatively lied when you
			filled out your personnel
			application and compounded that
			lie by repeating it to this
			committee?
			What -- ?
			Isn't - it - true... that the
			paternal grandfather of whom you
			speak was not Vulcan... but was
			in fact a Romulan? That it is
			Romulan blood you carry... and
			a Romulan heritage that you honor?
			We're waiting, Mister Tarses.
			On the advice of my counsel...
			I refuse to answer the question...
			in that... the answer... may
			serve... to incriminate me.
			Ensign Bailey, you and Crewman
			Marcus will coordinate to track
			Tarses' movements for the last
			five years. Ensign Kellogg, I
			want a list of all his
			relatives... his known
			associates... especially old
			school friends...
			And make arrangements to do an
			encephalographic polygraph scan...
			Mister Worf...
			Yes, Captain?
			I need to speak with you.
			You are dismissed. Please get
			your reports to me as soon as
			possible.
			What is going on here?
			Captain... I am conducting the
			investigation of Simon Tarses.
			What has happened to us, Mister
			Worf?
			Sir?
			I think... we're putting on a
			drumhead trial...
			I don't understand...
			Five hundred years ago military
			officers would upend a drum on
			the battlefield... sit at it and
			dispense summary justice...
			decisions were quick...
			punishments severe... appeals
			denied. Those who came to a
			drumhead were doomed.
			But... we know there is a traitor
			here. J'Dan has admitted his
			guilt.
			That's true. And he will stand
			for his crimes.
			Tarses has all but done the same.
			How?
			He refused to answer the
			question... about his Romulan
			grandfather.
			That is not a crime, Worf. Nor
			can we infer his guilt because
			he did not respond.
			If a man is not afraid of the
			truth, he would answer.
			No. We must not let ourselves
			think that. The Seventh Guarantee
			is one of the most important
			rights granted by the Federation.
			We cannot use one of the
			fundamental principles of our
			Constitution and turn it against
			a citizen.
			Sir... the Federation does have
			enemies... we must seek them
			out...
			Yes... that's how it starts. But
			the road from legitimate suspicion
			to rampant paranoia is shorter
			than we might think. Something
			is wrong here, Worf... I don't
			like what we have become.
			Here you are, Mister Tarses...
			do you care for lemon?
			No, thank you, sir. This is fine.
			Tell me a little about yourself,
			Crewman... I know you were born
			on Mars Colony...
			Yes, sir... All my life I wanted
			to be in Starfleet. I went to
			the Academy's program for enlisted
			personnel... took training as a
			medical technician... served at
			several outposts... and the day
			I was posted to the Enterprise
			was the happiest day of my life.
			Did you ever consider applying
			to the Academy... going the whole
			route and becoming an officer?
			My parents wanted me to... and
			I thought about it... I used to
			sit under this big tree near the
			parade grounds...
			An elm tree? With a circular
			bench?
			That's the one...
			I spent many an hour there. It
			was my favorite spot to study.
			I used to sit... and watch the
			drills... and picture myself an
			officer. I knew it would make
			my mother happy...
			But you didn't do it.
			No... I was eighteen, and eager...
			the last thing I wanted to do was
			spend four years sitting in
			classrooms... I wanted to be out
			there... traveling the stars...
			I didn't want to wait for
			anything...
			And now... it's done, isn't it?
			My career in Starfleet is
			finished...
			Not if you aren't guilty.
			It doesn't matter. I lied on my
			application... and that mistake
			will be with me for the rest of
			my life.
			I couldn't wait to get started...
			and now it's over...
			Mister Worf has found a brother
			who still lives on Mars Colony...
			contact someone there and have
			him interviewed...
			Admiral Satie...
			... and start a background check
			into all his friends from the
			Academy training program.
			Yes, Captain?
			I'd like to talk to you.
			Of course.
			In private...
			... and off the record.
			Of course, Captain.
			After all... you are my partner
			in this.
			I cannot possibly believe you mean
			this.
			But I do. This must stop. It's
			gone too far... you lied to him
			about the Engine Room -- there
			was no volatile chemical found
			there...
			It's just a tactic... a way of
			applying pressure.
			We are hounding an innocent man.
			And how, may I ask, have you
			managed to determine that?
			I talked with him.
			I see. And he told you he was
			a victim of circumstance...
			blameless and pure...
			No... he admits his mistake in
			falsifying his application... but
			that doesn't make him a traitor.
			Can you be so incredibly
			naive... ?
			Captain... do you know how I have
			spent the last four years?
			Traveling from planet to Starbase
			to planet...
			I have no home... I live on
			starships and shuttlecraft... I
			haven't seen a family member in
			years... I have no friends.
			But I have a purpose. My father
			taught me... from the time I was
			a little girl still clutching a
			blanket... that the United
			Federation of Planets is the most
			remarkable institution ever
			conceived. It is my cause to make
			sure that this extraordinary union
			is preserved...
			I cannot imagine why you are
			suddenly trying to block this
			investigation... there have been
			others, in the past, who got in
			my way. They came to regret it.
			The hearings on Simon Tarses must
			stop. If necessary, I will go
			to Starfleet Command.
			Captain, I have news for you...
			I've been in constant contact with
			Starfleet Command. And the
			hearings aren't going to stop --
			they're going to be expanded.
			What are you saying -- ?
			I am going to get to the heart
			of this conspiracy... if it means
			investigating every last person
			on this ship.
			And every hearing from now on
			will be held in the presence of
			Admiral Thomas Henry of Starfleet
			Security. I've requested that
			he be brought here at once...
			You never told me about this --
			I report directly to Starfleet
			Command. I do not require your
			permission or your approval for
			my decisions.
			Admiral... what you're doing
			here... is unethical... it's
			immoral... and I will fight it.
			Do what you must, Captain. And
			so will I.
			Captain, the warp engines are back
			on line. We are ready to
			commence restart sequences.
			Sir?
			Yes... ? Oh... yes, Mister Data.
			Proceed.
			Are you all right, Captain?
			Yes, of course. Just a bit --
			preoccupied.
			Admiral Satie has ordered you to
			report to the interrogation room
			at oh-nine-hundred hours tomorrow
			morning.
			You are to be questioned before
			the committee.
			Your full name?
			Jean-Luc Picard.
			Rank and position?
			Captain, Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			How long have you held that post?
			Over three years. Since Stardate
			41140.
			Very well.
			Admiral?
			If you don't mind... I would like
			to address the committee.
			If you have a statement, you'll
			get an opportunity to make it
			later --
			I believe that Chapter Four,
			Article Twelve of the Uniform Code
			of Justice grants me the right
			to make a statement before
			questioning begins...
			Very well.
			I am deeply concerned by what is
			happening here. It began when
			we apprehended a spy, a man who
			admitted his guilt and who will
			answer for his crime. But the
			hunt didn't stop there. Another
			man, Simon Tarses, was brought
			to trial -- and it was a trial,
			no matter what others may call
			it.
			Unfortunately, it was a trial
			based on insinuation and innuendo.
			Nothing substantive against
			Crewman Tarses was offered, much
			less proven.
			This man has a Romulan
			grandfather. For that, his career
			stands in ruins. Have we become
			so fearful? Have we become so
			cowardly that we must extinguish
			a man because he carries the blood
			of a current enemy?
			I remind you... we are not
			descended from cowardly people.
			We come from those who were
			willing to think the unthinkable,
			speak the unspeakable...
			... and to defend with passion
			ideas and causes which were, at
			the moment, unpopular.
			Admiral, let us not condemn Simon
			Tarses or anyone else on the basis
			of half-truth. I implore you...
			do not continue with this
			proceeding. End it here.
			Captain Picard... do you believe
			in the Prime Directive?
			Of course.
			In fact, it is Starfleet General
			Order Number One, isn't it?
			Your point, Admiral... ?
			Would it surprise you to learn
			that you have violated the Prime
			Directive a total of nine times
			since you took command of the
			Enterprise?
			I must say, Captain, it surprised
			the hell out of me.
			My reports to Starfleet document
			the circumstances in each of those
			instances --
			Yes, we're looking into those
			reports, Captain, very closely
			into those reports... after which
			I'm sure we'll have more questions
			for you about your so-called
			commitment to Starfleet's Prime
			Directive.
			Captain, could you explain just
			what happened on Stardate 44390?
			Excuse me?
			Let me refresh your memory. You
			were transporting a Vulcan
			ambassador... T'Pel...
			I was following orders to deliver
			the ambassador to a destination
			near the Neutral Zone, and --
			I don't think we need the
			preamble.
			In fact, she was not a Vulcan at
			all, was she? She was a Romulan
			spy.
			That's correct.
			A spy whom you delivered back
			into the hands of the enemy.
			Tell me, Captain... when the
			deception was revealed... and she
			stood proudly on the Bridge of
			a Romulan ship... did you make
			any effort to retrieve her?
			No.
			No? Even though you knew she
			carried Federation secrets she
			had been accumulating for years?
			There was no chance of getting
			her back. We were deep in Romulan
			space. The safety of my crew was
			my primary concern.
			The Enterprise could have been
			captured by Romulans... Captain
			Picard did the only thing he could.
			Really, Lieutenant? And where
			were you while this traitor was
			on board the Enterprise? Where
			was ship's security?
			Wouldn't you say it is
			questionable judgment, Captain,
			to have a security officer whose
			father was a Romulan
			collaborator?
			Lieutenant?
			Captain Picard... have you fully
			recovered from your experience
			with the Borg?
			Yes. I am fully recovered.
			It must have been awful...
			actually becoming one of them...
			being forced to use your vast
			knowledge of Starfleet operations
			to aid the Borg...
			Just how many of our ships were
			destroyed?
			...ah. I have it...
			thirty-nine... with the loss of
			life measured at nearly eleven
			thousand...
			One wonders how this man can sleep
			at night... having caused so much
			destruction...
			I question your actions,
			Captain... I question your
			choices... I question your
			loyalty...
			There is a saying... which many
			of us have heard since we were
			school children... "With the first
			link, the chain is forged. The
			first speech censured, the first
			thought forbidden, the first
			freedom denied -- chains us all,
			irrevocably."
			Those words were uttered by Judge
			Aaron Satie -- as wisdom and
			warning. The very first time any
			man's freedoms are trampled...
			we are all damaged.
			I fear... that today... on this
			starship... we are forging that
			chain.
			How dare you -- you who consort
			with Romulans... invoke my
			father's name to support your
			traitorous arguments... It is
			an offense... to everything I hold
			dear... to hear those words used
			to subvert the United Federation
			of Planets.
			My father was a great man... his
			name stands for principle, and
			integrity... you dirty that name
			by speaking it...
			He loved the Federation...
			but you, Picard... corrupt it...
			you and those like you undermine
			our very way of life...
			I will expose you for what you
			are... I've brought down bigger
			men than you, Picard...
			I have nothing more to say.
			Perhaps... we should take a
			recess... until tomorrow.
			Am I bothering you, sir?
			No... please, come in, Mister
			Worf.
			It's over. Admiral Henry has
			called an end to any more hearings
			on this matter.
			That's good.
			Admiral Satie... has left the
			Enterprise.
			We think we have come so far...
			the torture of heretics and the
			burning of witches is ancient
			history... and then... before you
			can blink an eye... it threatens
			to start all over again.
			I believed her... I helped her...
			I didn't see what she was.
			Villains who wear black hats are
			easy to spot. Those who clothe
			themselves in good deeds are well
			camouflaged.
			I think... after yesterday...
			people will not be as ready to
			trust her.
			Maybe. But it won't stop her.
			She -- someone like her -- will
			always be with us... waiting for
			the right climate to flourish...
			spreading disease in the name of
			liberty.
			Vigilance, Worf. That is the
			price we must continually pay.
