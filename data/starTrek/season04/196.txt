			Counselor Deanna Troi, personal
			log, stardate 44805.3...
			... My mother is on board.
			Jean-Luc, you delicious man, you
			were just thinking of me, weren't
			you?
			As a matter of fact, I...
			Well think no further, Dear
			Heart... She's here!
			Yes, indeed.
			Serious; always so serious.
			Well at the moment, Lwaxana, I
			am rather busy.
			And you're always busy with
			something or other.
			Never the right thing, though.
			My daughter says we're picking
			up someone interesting here?
			Yes. The leading scientist of
			Kaelon Two and...
			Kaelon Two? Never heard of it.
			This is a delicate situation,
			Lwaxana... our first real contact
			with a very reclusive people...
			And as it will be something of
			an official greeting...
			Ah, diplomacy; I adore diplomacy.
			Everyone dresses so well...
			Energize, please, Mister O'Brien.
			Doctor Timicin? I am Jean-Luc
			Picard, Captain of The Enterprise.
			This is Lieutenant Commander La
			Forge.
			We welcome you aboard, Sir.
			I beg your pardon, Captain...
			this is my first time aboard a
			Federation starship...
			Oh yes, they told me... shaking
			of hands... a greeting...
			Ah, I beg your pardon. Doctor
			Timicin, may I present Lwaxana
			Troi, of Betazed; also a guest
			on board, and...
			... And Daughter of The Fifth
			House, Holder of the Sacred
			Chalice of Rixx, Heir to the Holy
			Rings of Betazed, and what are
			you doing for dinner?
			Well, I...
			... I don't know, really.
			We have quite a bit of work
			planned...
			The man's never been on a
			starship before, Jean-Luc...
			somebody certainly ought to make
			him comfortable before you get
			started.
			It, uh... would seem Mrs. Troi
			is our acting ambassador of good
			will today.
			Just think of me as your
			Entertainment Director.
			That man is in a lot of trouble.
			Captain's Log. Stardate 44805.7.
			For generations, the people of
			Kaelon Two have been working to
			revitalize their dying sun. The
			Federation has offered to assist
			in testing what may be a solution
			to this problem.
			The basic theories for helium
			fusion enhancement have been
			discussed for over a century...
			but there's been no method of
			practical application until now...
			The modifications that you have
			made on the torpedo's guidance
			systems are remarkable, doctor...
			We'll see. They still have to
			be proven in a practical test.
			At least, now it is possible.
			I never dared hope to find such
			a perfect match with our own sun.
			Our only regret is that it took
			us three years to find a suitable
			star after you first contacted
			us.
			This means a great deal to us,
			to me... We are not used to
			dealing with other worlds... to
			asking for anything from others.
			But your offer to help... it has
			given us a possible means to our
			survival.
			It's your work that's made this
			possible, Doctor...
			That's right, we're only the
			delivery service here...
			It has taken forty years of my
			life to develop the programming
			which will control your photon
			torpedos... it has been my life...
			my only wish has been to find a
			way to revive our sun before I
			die... thank you for giving me
			this opportunity.
			Mrs. Troi, I must protest your
			unauthorized presence on the
			Bridge.
			What does this little one do,
			Mister Woof?
			Please, Madame! That is a
			torpedo launch initiator. And
			it, uh... it is Worf, Madame; not
			Woof.
			Oh.
			Ah, there you are, dear; I've been
			waiting for you.
			And so nice to see you again so
			soon.
			Mrs. Troi.
			Yes, Mother, what did you want?
			What?
			You were waiting for me.
			Of course I was, dear.
			You really must let me do
			something to relieve the tedium
			of all this work, work, work...
			As a matter of fact, we really
			haven't...
			Mother.
			Yes, dear. You go play now;
			mother'll be fine.
			Mother!
			I'm afraid I'm expected in
			Engineering. I'm really terribly
			sorry...
			Mrs. Troi? I'll have to ask you
			to clear the Bridge now, please.
			I don't see why. There are lots
			of other people here.
			Mother? Please!
			Don't you worry, we'll just have
			to chat a bit later.
			I'd never have thought her old
			enough to be your mother. She's
			so... vibrant.
			Is that why you reset the torpedo
			sustainer engines to run on less
			reactants?
			Exactly... once we were able to
			protect the triggering mechanism,
			the flight engine power levels
			could be minimized...
			... now if we take a look at
			another simulation, you'll see
			that the temperature should
			stabilize at two-twenty...
			Enough is enough; rescue is at
			hand. Doctor Timicin, will you
			clear all that mess from the
			table, please?
			That mess? Mrs. Troi...
			Now now now, you've been shut up
			in here for hours; perfectly
			ridiculous.
			The table, please.
			If you boys don't eat something
			you're going to be sick and who's
			that going to help? I've made
			some irresistible Mantickian pate.
			Mister Homn will lay it out for
			us.
			Mister Homn is my valet. He
			doesn't say much.
			How can he?
			It is true that the intellectual
			efficiency of high order beings
			does diminish proportionately when
			the deprivation of rest or
			nutritious fuel is...
			All right, all right; don't you
			start.
			Mrs. Troi...
			You are a wise woman. I'm sure
			we could use a respite.
			These two call me Mrs. Troi. You
			call me Lwaxana. Mister Homn?
			Spread it.
			So, knowing that my daughter's
			starship would be passing fairly
			close to Betazed, I maneuvered
			a ride, and here I am.
			Deck Eight.
			I also have a grown daughter.
			She has a little boy of her own.
			Then you're married.
			My wife died quite some time ago.
			One thing I don't understand...
			if your people have known for
			generations that their sun is
			dying... why not simply evacuate
			the planet?
			It is our home... it defines who
			we are as a people. If Kaelon
			ceases to exist... so do we...
			Then you definitely should fix
			it.
			With the Federation's help... I
			hope we will.
			And the Federation is pleased to
			offer whatever help it can. Which
			means you will come in for a
			nightcap?
			That's extremely kind of you,
			but...
			My valet sleeps elsewhere.
			You are delightful. You make
			me laugh. I mean, I don't mean
			your invitation makes me laugh...
			I mean I take it quite seriously
			but...
			Then say yes. And I'll make you
			laugh some more.
			I... wish I could. But I have
			to say "no".
			Goodnight, Lwaxana.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44807.5.
			The Enterprise has arrived at the
			Praxillus system, where we will
			conduct Doctor Timicin's helium
			ignition test.
			Mother, how much...
			Little one... why do you refuse
			to use telepathy even when we are
			alone?
			We are not alone, Mother. Now
			how much longer will this take?
			You've been selecting for twenty
			minutes.
			I am a woman dressing for a man.
			Something you might try now and
			then, dear. I wonder if Timicin
			likes green.
			That's not very telepathic of you.
			I tried telepathy on him; he's
			the wrong species. Right species
			for everything else, though. And
			you might try that once in a
			while, too.
			You know, you're not just
			incorrigible; you're insatiable.
			Captain... I have completed long
			range scans. No life forms are
			present in the system.
			Spacecraft?
			No others within sensor range...
			Picard to Engineering...
			... the system is clear, Mister
			La Forge.
			Final pre-launch diagnostic.
			Level Five.
			All systems verified.
			We're ready when you are, Captain.
			Very well. Mister Worf?
			Photon torpedoes... armed and
			targeted.
			Fire in sequence.
			First volley released...
			Tracking torpedoes... entry
			program confirmed.
			Second volley released... third
			volley...
			Torpedoes now entering the stellar
			core.
			Their shields are holding.
			Guidance systems normal.
			Ignition sequence... six
			seconds... three seconds... Now.
			Shock wave patterns within
			predicted range. Seventeen
			hundred percent rise in gamma
			radiation levels. Helium
			fusion rate increasing...
			What about the heat and pressure
			levels?
			Steady so far. Density at eleven
			hundred grams per cubic
			centimeter. Temperature
			approaching sixty million degrees
			Kelvin.
			We want it to stabilize at two
			hundred and twenty million.
			Pressure wave harmonics
			dispersing. Temperature in target
			zone increasing... to eighty-one
			million degrees.
			Still rising. Ninety million
			degrees Kelvin... And now one
			hundred ten million.
			Looking good.
			One hundred thirty-seven...
			Radiation and pressure levels
			still stable.
			Temperature one hundred sixty
			million degrees Kelvin...
			One seventy... one ninety...
			Now two hundred million...
			It's happening.
			Two-oh-seven, and rising.
			Two-nineteen...
			And twenty! Two twenty!
			And holding!
			Looks like congratulations may
			be in order.
			Mister Data?
			Turbulence patterns are within
			predicted parameters.
			Two-twenty-two...
			Temperature is rising in the core
			again, Captain. Two hundred and
			thirty million degrees Kelvin...
			... Now two-fifty-one. Still
			rising. Two hundred sixty million
			degrees.
			Rate exceeding critical levels.
			Core density becoming unstable.
			Let's get the hell out of here.
			Warp two, Ensign; now!
			I'm sorry.
			Captain Picard? Permit me...
			... to express my appreciation to
			you and your crew. I am...
			... most grateful.
			Most grateful.
			Ensign... set a course for Kaelon
			Two. Warp factor five.
			Timicin, I'm so sorry.
			I had one of those named after
			me once; by a brilliant young
			astronomer from Rigel Four.
			Of course, I sparkled a bit myself
			in those days.
			That's called fishing for a
			compliment. You're supposed to
			tell me that I still sparkle.
			I'm sorry, I'm not helping, am
			I?
			You're very kind. I'm just not
			adequate company right now.
			That's all right, I can make
			enough conversation for both of
			us.
			I'll leave you alone.
			No. Please stay... I wanted to
			tell you how much I wish that...
			That we had met... years ago.
			What difference do a few years
			make?
			Unfortunately, a great deal.
			The fact is, Lwaxana... I'm going
			home now... to die.
			Captain's log, stardate 44812.6.
			We are orbiting Kaelon Two, and
			have established contact with
			Science Minister B'tardat.
			The experiment did achieve a
			stable core temperature for a
			short time, Minister... that is
			a significant step forward...
			We're studying the sensor logs
			and torpedo telemetry to see if
			there was any malfunction... if
			we can discover the problem,
			another test might be successful.
			But wouldn't that require a
			lengthy search to find a suitable
			star for a second test?
			The Federation is willing to
			assist in the search.
			In the meantime, all of our
			facilities would be available to
			Doctor Timicin while he analyzes
			the experiment.
			A most thoughtful and generous
			offer. But Timicin has
			obligations at home. And it will
			take some time to select his
			replacement.
			We're more than willing to extend
			our visit, sir.
			That will not be necessary.
			We'll contact you when we're
			ready.
			We expect Timicin to return home
			as soon as possible. Again,
			gentlemen, thank you.
			Come...
			Jean-Luc, are you aware that these
			people you're so graciously
			helping, are murderers?
			I beg your pardon?
			Well the next thing to it. When
			a person on this benighted little
			world reaches the age of sixty,
			which Timicin is about to do,
			they're expected to simply kill
			themselves. Did you know that?
			Mister Data?
			The people of Kaelon Two are
			isolationists. Almost to the
			point of being xenophobes.
			Regrettably, we know very little
			about their customs.
			Well, I know -- Timicin himself
			just told me. He's supposed to
			go down there to his loving
			friends; be wined, dined, honored
			for his achievements and then kill
			himself. It's a barbaric ritual.
			"The Resolution", it's called.
			Obviously, you can't let him go,
			Jean-Luc.
			I'm afraid I have no choice.
			I don't think you've been
			listening to me. The man is
			supposed to kill himself! You
			don't just let that happen. You
			don't just turn your back. What's
			the matter with you!
			Lwaxana, I'm sorry, but I have
			no jurisdiction here; irrespective
			of any personal feelings. We
			simply cannot interfere --
			But you have to. In a situation
			like this, you absolutely have
			to interfere.
			Go down there and talk to those
			people, Jean-Luc. Do all the
			things you do so well... open
			their eyes, educate them...
			The Prime Directive forbids us
			to interfere with the social order
			of any planet.
			It's your Prime Directive -- not
			mine!
			Computer? Locate Counselor Troi.
			What d'you mean I "can't" go down
			there? Are you telling me I'm
			a prisoner on this ship?
			Mother? What's going on? What
			are you doing?
			I'm sorry, Counselor, but... I'm
			not sure what to do here.
			Well I'm sure.
			I am a Betazoid ambassador; the
			Daughter of the Fifth House, and
			those people are going to
			answer to me!
			So you just energize this damned
			thing and get me down there!
			He can't, Mother. he has his
			orders.
			His orders don't apply to me.
			No, they apply to him.
			Don't try your professional
			patronizing on me, young lady.
			They expect Timicin to die, don't
			you realize that? He expects to
			die. Because he's sixty! What
			is sixty; it's nothing!
			I'll, uh... go check the pattern
			buffers.
			Come on, Mother, let's sit down.
			I'm sorry, little one. I don't
			know what's wrong with me. I'm
			sorry.
			There's no need to be.
			But I'm crying. I don't cry.
			You cried when father died.
			You remember that?
			Of course I remember. We both
			cried.
			But this isn't the same... Is
			it?
			What do you think, Mother?
			I don't know. I just can't
			accept that fate would allow me
			to meet him like this... and then
			take him away. He's not ill. He
			hasn't had a tragic accident.
			He's just going to die... for no
			good reason... except his society
			has decided he's too old... so
			they dispose of him. As though
			his life no longer has value or
			meaning.
			You can't possibly understand
			at your age... but at mine...
			sometimes, you feel tired. And
			afraid.
			You... afraid? I never could
			tell...
			You weren't supposed to. Life
			really does pass, Deanna. The
			fun of it; the joy; the... being
			attractive.
			You're feeling very vulnerable;
			very...
			... mortal, if I may say so. I
			know you so well, Mother. And
			believe me, you will never be one
			of those who dies before they die.
			Come in.
			I've been studying the preliminary
			reports from the test. I don't
			understand where I went wrong...
			I thought I'd anticipated all of
			the variables; deep convection
			patterns, the proton reactions,
			neutrino count...
			I'll say it again. You're a kind
			woman.
			I'm a hateful woman. I hate what
			you're going to do, and I hate
			you for doing it.
			It's the way of my world. I wish
			you could accept that.
			I never will... Never...
			How long have you been sitting
			there?
			I'm not sure. A minute. An hour.
			Lwaxana...
			Do you want anything... some
			tea... ?
			Lwaxana, I want to explain. I
			want very much for you to
			understand.
			Until fifteen or twenty centuries
			ago, we had no "Resolution"; no
			such concern for our Elders. As
			people aged, their health failed;
			they became invalids. Those who
			could no longer be cared for by
			their families were put away in
			deathwatch facilities, where they
			simply waited in loneliness for
			the end to come; often for years.
			They had meant something; and then
			they were forced to live past
			that; through a terrible time of
			meaning nothing; of knowing they
			could now only be the
			beneficiaries of younger people's
			patience. We are no longer that
			cruel, Lwaxana.
			No, you're not cruel to them.
			You just kill them!
			The Resolution is a celebration
			of life... we can end our lives
			with dignity...
			"Celebration of life"... it all
			sounds very noble, very caring.
			What you're really saying is you
			got rid of the problem by getting
			rid of the people...
			I know it must sound that way...
			It is a time of transition...
			one generation handing the
			responsibilities of life to the
			next...
			What about the responsibility of
			taking care of the elderly?
			But that would create a dreadful
			burden for our children...
			We raise them and care for them,
			suffer for them and keep them from
			harm their whole lives...
			eventually, it's their turn to
			take care of us.
			No parent should expect to be paid
			back for the love they've given
			their children.
			Why the hell not.
			Oskoids.
			What's that?
			Oskoids. A Betazed delicacy.
			Looks interesting.
			You should have tried it while
			you were still alive. No reason
			to bother now.
			Why sixty? Why not... sixty-two...
			or fifty-eight...
			A reasonable age had to be set...
			... but it's not reasonable...
			certainly not in your case.
			Right now, you're as healthy and
			vital a man as I've ever known.
			... And I want to say good-bye to
			my family and colleagues while I'm
			still that way... in complete
			command of my faculties... knowing
			they'll always remember me as a
			strong, vigorous man.
			But it makes no sense. Some of
			your people could still be active
			at seventy or eighty... others
			might get seriously ill at
			fifty... how cruel of you to make
			them wait so long to commit
			suicide...
			Setting a standard age for the
			resolution makes it uniform for
			everybody. To ask each individual
			family to decide when their elders
			are to die... would be heartless.
			I agree. How about letting
			everybody die when they die.
			Lwaxana...
			You have a grandson, you said?
			Almost seven.
			Wouldn't it be better for him to
			know his grandfather? Not the
			vague memory of someone who once
			loved him, but a living person
			who does love him? You really
			don't believe that's better?
			Lwaxana, I attended the Resolution
			of my own parents when it was
			their time. It was beautiful.
			It's a custom I've known and
			accepted all my life.
			The women of Betazed used to wear
			huge wigs; with large holes in
			the middle for tiny caged animals.
			First it was a fashion; then it
			went on long enough to become a
			custom. A tradition. But it was
			uncomfortable for the woman and
			cruel to the animal. Then one
			day one very formidable woman
			finally said so; and refused to
			wear another of those wigs. And
			fairly soon the custom stopped.
			She had the courage to stand up
			and fight for change.
			She must have been a lot like you.
			Timicin, there is no one more
			qualified, more experienced, or
			more likely to save your planet
			than you. And they would have
			you kill yourself?
			Younger scientists will take my
			place. The work will continue.
			Your planet has what... thirty,
			forty years left? What if they
			can't find the answer without your
			help? What then? What chance
			will your grandson have of
			reaching the age of sixty?
			Enough; please. It is my time,
			Lwaxana. That is the way it is.
			If that's the way it is, why is
			anyone bothering to try to save
			your world at all? If its time
			has come, let it die. Where's
			the difference, Timicin? Where?
			... Until the pressure levels
			destabilized, all the results were
			exactly as you had predicted...
			The triggering programs... ?
			Worked perfectly... that much
			we're sure of...
			And we had always assumed that
			was our greatest hurdle...
			Just getting this far is a big
			step, Doctor... no one's ever
			been able to do even this much
			before...
			Convection boundary uncoupling.
			The reaction caused gas turbulence
			of a totally unexpected
			magnitude... Why?
			There was a evidence of a delayed
			surface shock...
			No, I anticipated that I thought
			I'd anticipated all the possible
			variables... but stars... they're
			like living entities in a way...
			quite unpredictable. I wouldn't
			be surprised if this were the
			result of...
			Look here... forty-two seconds
			into the test, a rise in the level
			of hydrogen-alpha emissions...
			and here, another one... You
			see, I'm right...
			There had to be neutron migration
			within the star's inner core as
			the reaction grew.
			Perhaps, but there is no known
			method of controlling neutron
			migration, Doctor.
			Yes, yes, but it is theoretically
			possible. Using these test
			results, we could construct a new
			computer model of the energy
			dynamics of the star that can
			test a new detonation program.
			I'm certain it can be
			accomplished. Certain. It's
			just a matter of time.
			A matter of time.
			Come.
			Timicin. Time for you to leave
			us, then.
			Captain Picard... I've come to...
			officially request asylum aboard
			The Enterprise.
			Timicin, I cannot believe this.
			Why asylum? Asylum from what?
			I turn sixty in four days,
			Minister...
			Yes, and your family and
			colleagues are already gathering
			for your resolution...
			I...
			I believe it is time for us as
			a people to re-examine the wisdom
			of The Resolution.
			Timicin, are they forcing you into
			this? Are you being coerced?
			Influenced, perhaps; not coerced.
			Captain Picard, your "influence"
			is an example of why we originally
			chose isolation and no doubt will
			again.
			Any influence, Minister, is by
			example only. Timicin's decision
			is of his own free will, I assure
			you.
			I cannot believe that a man of
			Timicin's stature would "freely"
			reject his own culture.
			B'Tardat, no one on Kaelon Two
			understands the project as I do.
			There are new theories that would
			take others a decade to test and
			confirm. With my guidance, we
			can be ready in half that time.
			I must finish my work...
			Others started your work. Others
			will finish it. It's always been
			that way... it always will...
			Captain, scanners indicate two
			Kaelon warships rising on an
			intercept course.
			Acknowledged, Commander.
			Minister, we are here in
			friendship, hoping to provide
			assistance...
			You've helped quite enough,
			Captain. I suggest you return
			Timicin and depart.
			If you attempt to leave orbit with
			him on board, our ships have been
			ordered to open fire.
			B'tardat, there's no purpose in...
			It should not have come to this...
			I handled it poorly...
			Doctor, you have acted in good
			conscience... I don't know what
			else you could have done...
			I could have... let well enough
			alone... and returned home...
			What do you think, Picard? Have
			I done the right thing?
			I'm afraid you're the only one
			who can answer that, Doctor.
			Lwaxana would have me lead a
			revolt, but I am only a scientist.
			I wish I had her strength... she
			is a woman of extraordinary
			conviction, isn't she?
			Isn't she.
			Any communication, Number One?
			No, sir. We have an open channel.
			The warships have taken a standard
			attack posture... staggered
			approach vectors... within
			weapons range.
			Shields up. Red Alert.
			Captain...
			Doctor, I suggest you return to
			your quarters...
			No. I don't want there to be any
			bloodshed because of my
			decision...
			They'll be doing everything they
			can to avoid it... but we need
			to get out of their way now...
			Mister Worf, ascertain their
			offensive potential...
			Aye sir.
			Yes... yes I understand...
			We must transmit the new analysis
			of the neutron migration
			immediately... if I can make them
			see the direction I've taken...
			We've already tried...
			They refuse to accept further
			reports from you, Doctor.
			But they have to accept them...
			If I can re-establish computer
			interface with the science
			ministry...
			They've disengaged the link-up,
			sir...
			Why don't they answer!?
			Even if I find the solution,
			they would not accept it!
			Because I do not terminate my
			life, they terminate my work.
			Alive, I am a greater threat to
			my world than a dying sun.
			Jean-Luc will find a way to settle
			this. He always does...
			No, my decision will only lead
			to more distrust of other
			worlds... nothing will change...
			Don't be foolish.
			I am not being foolish.
			Lwaxana, I want to live because
			I see in you how much there is
			to live for. You make me realize
			there is still some value to my
			life. I can still contribute.
			I can be an example to my people.
			But discovering these new desires
			in myself... and not being able to
			do anything with them... not
			being able to finish my work, not
			being able to reach my people...
			You have made a statement about
			the sanctity of life. It will
			be heard, Timicin.
			Who will hear it... from
			lightyears away. Where do I go
			now, Lwaxana? A man without a
			world. Who can never go home.
			Timicin...
			Bridge to Doctor Timicin...
			... you have a visitor coming
			aboard.
			B'Tardat?
			No, doctor... it's your daughter.
			Father...
			Dara.
			You look... wonderful.
			This is Lwaxana Troi. She's been
			a host and a friend.
			I've been looking forward to
			meeting you, Dara.
			Whatever you have to say to me,
			you can say in front of her.
			I see.
			Father, come home. This is
			wrong.
			Dara, there is so much for me
			still to do. If I could show you
			the work I have begun...
			There's nothing for me to look
			at. It is irrelevant.
			Your father's work may save your
			world, my dear. I would hardly
			consider that irrelevant.
			All that matters to me now is you.
			Not your work. Your work's over.
			It is your time to rest.
			Perhaps you will feel differently
			as you get a little older... say
			approaching sixty.
			My father has taught me to cherish
			The Resolution. I don't know how
			you have poisoned him to reject
			it but...
			It is an obscene ritual.
			How dare you. How dare you
			criticize my way of life, my
			beliefs.
			Please.
			Where will you go?
			I don't know.
			Where will you die?
			I cannot bear the thought that
			you will be laid to rest on some
			other world...
			... that you will not lie beside
			my mother... and I will not be
			able to lie beside you when my
			resolution comes.
			I'm sorry, Father. I do not
			understand how you can go on with
			your life knowing each day you
			live is an insult to everything
			we believe in. I love you. But
			I am ashamed.
			I... need to be alone now.
			I am suddenly... suddenly not sure
			of myself... and it is a feeling
			I am not at all used to... I don't
			think I like it very much, Little
			One...
			Not sure of yourself?
			My life has been full. Now and
			then it's even overflowed a
			little, I'll admit. But I
			enjoy...living. Now I am asking
			myself -- is it possible that I've
			been wrong to encourage Timicin
			to choose life?
			You were honest with him,
			mother... how could you be
			anything else?
			Maybe I want him to live... just
			to keep me company.
			Of course you do. But you didn't
			do this for yourself, mother.
			You did it for him.
			Did I? Then look what I've done
			to him. He is like a man who has
			lost his faith. I never
			considered how deeply ingrained
			this resolution liturgy is.
			Ritual provides a structure for
			a society... good rituals, bad
			rituals alike...
			Well, this is a bad one...
			Your point of view.
			It should be the point of view
			of any reasonably intelligent
			middle-aged person.
			But apparently it is not.
			I'll see you later, mother.
			You're going back.
			Do you believe I love you?
			I do you know. But if that
			finally is my only reason to stay
			alive...
			It's not enough.
			Almost. Not quite. I can't be
			that selfish, Lwaxana.
			You'd never be happy.
			I'm sorry. I guess I'm not the
			one to lead the revolt.
			I apologize for all the turmoil
			I created, Captain...
			I would deeply regret it, Doctor,
			if you were returning only to ease
			diplomatic tensions...
			No, it is more, much more.
			Then I wish you and your people
			well.
			When the time comes for another
			test, I will encourage them to
			seek out your assistance again.
			If there's any reason you'd like
			to wait a few minutes...
			No. We've... we've said our
			good-byes.
			Lwaxana... ?
			It is the custom for your loved
			ones to join you at this...
			resolution, is it not?
			You don't have to do this.
			Yes. I do.
			Permission to disembark,
			Captain... I promise not to cause
			any problems down there.
			Permission granted.
			We're ready, Mister O'Brien.
