			Captain's Log, Stardate 44614.6:
			We are approaching Starbase
			Three-One-Three, where we will
			pick up a shipment of scientific
			equipment for a Federation outpost
			in the Guernica System. At the
			same time --
			-- we will be hosting a special
			guest.
			You wanted to see me, Captain?
			Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems
			that the exemplary nature of your
			work has caught the attention of
			Starfleet Command.
			Well... that's very flattering.
			Thank you, sir.
			In fact, someone is coming on
			board just to see some of the
			engine modifications you have
			made.
			Who's that, Captain?
			The Senior Design Engineer of the
			Theoretical Propulsion Group --
			Doctor Leah Brahms.
			Leah's coming here? That's
			terrific!
			You know Doctor Brahms?
			Well, of course I do! I --
			I mean, I've studied her -- her
			schematics for years. She was
			responsible for a lot of the
			engine design on the Enterprise.
			Well, it should be an enjoyable
			visit, then. She'll be
			transporting on board as soon as
			we arrive at the Starbase. Would
			you like to greet her on our
			behalf?
			Why... yes, Captain. I'd be happy
			to serve that function.
			You're gonna wear that uniform
			out if you keep swatting at it...
			I guess I'm a little nervous...
			it's not every day a man comes
			face to face with a dream...
			Remember... about a year ago...
			when we were caught in that
			booby-trap the Menthars set?
			Yes...
			While we were trying to get out
			of it, I went to the holodeck to
			study an engine prototype that
			was built when the Enterprise was
			first designed...
			Uh-huh...
			And the computer... well, it gave
			me an image of the engine... but
			it also created a hologram of the
			designer. Doctor Leah Brahms.
			So... you met a computer-simulated
			female...
			But what a computer-simulated
			female... She was brilliant, of
			course... but warm, friendly...
			We worked like one person... what
			I didn't think of, she did... I'd
			start sentences, she'd finish
			them. It was just so --
			comfortable...
			Okay, I know it was just a
			holographic image... but the
			computer was able to incorporate
			personality traits from her
			Starfleet record.
			We all fall in love with our
			fantasies, from time to time,
			La Forge...
			You've got it wrong, Guinan. I'm
			not necessarily expecting anything
			romantic. I just know that,
			whatever else, Leah Brahms and
			I will be good friends.
			Doctor Brahms is ready to
			transport, sir.
			Okay. Bring her over.
			Hi!
			I mean... welcome aboard, Doctor
			Brahms. I'm Lieutenant Commander
			Geordi La Forge. Chief Engineer.
			La Forge. So you're the one who's
			fouled up my engine design.
			... the matter/anti-matter ratio
			has been changed... the mixture
			isn't as rich as regulations
			dictate.
			Experience has shown me that too
			high a ratio diminishes
			efficiency. I worked with the
			mixture until I got the right
			balance.
			The magnetic plasma transfer to
			the warp field generators doesn't
			correspond to the recommended
			specs.
			Right. Again, I adjusted the
			flow... sometimes in space things
			work a little differently than
			they do on the drawing board.
			Is that a criticism, Commander?
			No, of course not. It's just...
			a well-known fact. There's
			theory... and there's
			application. They don't always
			jibe.
			You've charted a completely new
			swap-out schedule for main
			component replacement...
			You bet. I found the Starfleet
			estimates of MTBF units were
			unrealistic. I determined my own
			schedule based on observation and
			experience.
			Is that going to be your only
			defense, Commander? That same
			tired rhetoric...
			"Out here in the field we learn
			things you designers couldn't
			possibly understand... "
			In the first place, Doctor, I'm
			not aware of needing any
			defense... in the second place
			--
			Doctor Brahms... you have an
			incoming message on subspace...
			I'd like to hear this message
			privately.
			In my office. Be my guest.
			Commander, I am picking up some
			unusual readings from the Alpha
			Omicron system.
			At this range, all I can discern
			is that it is an asymmetrical
			field of intense energy.
			What type of radiation
			signature?
			Unknown, sir.
			Commander, the Alpha Omicron
			system has not yet been charted.
			I recommend that we take this
			opportunity for further research.
			We're way ahead of schedule...
			Alter course for Alpha Omicron.
			The anomaly is orbiting the
			seventh planet. It is a mass of
			plasma energy contained within
			discrete boundaries by an outer
			covering of silicates, actinides,
			and carbonaceaous chondrites.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Is it a ship?
			It does not conform to any known
			design.
			Any records of similar phenomena
			in Starfleet listings?
			None, sir. This has never been
			seen before.
			Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter
			impulse. Bring us into orbit
			around the seventh planet.
			Maintain a relative distance of
			ten kilometers from the object.
			Alert all science labs to standby.
			They should be coordinating their
			efforts with Commander Data.
			Aye, sir.
			Doctor Brahms... there's no reason
			for us to argue... we're both on
			the same side, here...
			I'm aware of that...
			So, why don't I take you on a
			little tour... show you the
			adjustments I've made... why I
			think they work... and... we can
			start pulling together on this.
			Okay... for instance, here in the
			dilithium chamber...
			What happened here? Who did this?
			You remember, the crystal's been
			reoriented to adjust the direction
			of the lattice structure.
			Remember? Why would I remember?
			Right, why would you? The ship
			was having some difficulties, so
			we made the modification. Hoping
			it would work. And... it did.
			So it was your idea?
			Well, not exclusively...
			It's curious... this modification
			was actually due to be
			introduced...
			... in the next class starship.
			Yes... how did you know?
			I didn't... It was the next
			logical step.
			Doctor, sometimes we have to
			fly by the seat of our pants
			out here... and it stands to
			reason that now and then we're
			gonna come up with the same
			solutions you do...
			Listen. I've got a personnel
			review scheduled to start in about
			five minutes, and it's been a long
			day for you. How about we...
			we get together later. Sort of...
			plan our agenda for the next day
			or two.
			Agenda?
			What it is we want to
			accomplish... the best way to
			go about it... and -- get to know
			each other. It might make things
			easier.
			Maybe you're right...
			Okay -- nineteen hundred hours...
			my quarters. Maybe we'll even
			have a bite to eat... I make great
			fungilli.
			I love fungilli.
			Is that right... ?
			Sensors are having difficulty
			penetrating the interior.
			However, the pattern of radiated
			output suggests a coherent system
			of energy storage and
			utilization.
			Then it was constructed by
			someone?
			It is a possibility, sir.
			However, sensor data gathered thus
			far suggests this is a naturally
			occurring phenomenon with
			biological properties.
			A lifeform?
			Yes, Captain.
			"Asked the child of the stranger
			without any name... whither you
			go... and whence you came?"
			"To the child's delight the answer
			came clear... To the end I go for
			it all starts here."
			It seems we were bread and
			buttered on the same nursery
			rhymes, Mister Worf.
			Mister Data, prepare three class
			five probes for launch. Mister
			Worf, begin compiling readings
			for transmission to Starfleet
			Headquarters.
			Ensign... aft thrusters. Standard
			observation posture.
			What would it be like,
			Counselor... no ship, no bulky
			spacesuit... just to live between
			the stars... and know that the
			entire galaxy was your home... ?
			We are being probed. Recommend
			we raise shields, sir...
			Negative. If we're curious about
			it, it has a right to be curious
			about us...
			Counselor, is this "curiosity"
			motivated by instinct or
			intelligence?
			It's impossible to tell, Captain.
			Change in readings, Captain. The
			lifeform has increased its energy
			output by fifty percent.
			It is moving toward us, sir!
			Reverse course, Ensign, easily...
			three hundred k.p.h. Nothing to
			alarm or provoke it...
			Aye, sir...
			We are being held, in an energy
			damping field, sir.
			Raise shields.
			No effect, Captain.
			Reverse power, full impulse.
			Impulse engines at full power.
			No change in our position.
			Red Alert!
			Commander La Forge, prepare to
			initiate the warp drive.
			Sorry, Captain... there's too much
			inteference to form a warp field.
			Warning. Radiation levels at
			sixty-five millirads per minute
			and rising.
			Riker to Doctor Crusher.
			Go ahead, Commander.
			All decks are to begin radiation
			protocol.
			Acknowledged. Crusher out.
			Warning. Radiation levels at
			three hundred millirads per minute
			and rising. Lethal exposure in
			one minute.
			Mister Worf... ready main
			phasers... minimum power.
			Ready.
			Fire.
			Radiation levels dropping back
			to normal, Captain.
			The energy patterns are breaking
			down... the lifeform's radiation
			signature is no longer stable.
			Energy output is negligible...
			radiation patterns are no longer
			coherent.
			I believe it is dead, sir.
			We are out here to explore, to
			make contact with other lifeforms,
			to establish peaceful relations,
			but not to interfere and
			absolutely not to destroy. And
			yet look what we have just done
			-- what I have just done.
			Captain, everything you did was
			consistent with established
			Starfleet procedures... what
			happened was an accident...
			unavoidable...
			The Bridge is yours, Number One.
			Captain, sensors are picking up
			a new energy reading from the
			lifeform.
			Elaborate, Mister Data...
			There is a new concentration of
			ionizing radiation growing in the
			center of its body.
			Then -- perhaps it's still
			alive...
			Computer... subdued lighting.
			No, no, too much. I just want
			it -- nice. You know. Cozy.
			Please state your request in
			precise candlepower.
			It's not a matter of precision,
			it's a matter of... mood.
			Brighter than this.
			More... more... a little more --
			there! That's perfect. Now,
			music... maybe a little soft
			jazz...
			No... not right... maybe -- oh,
			I got it! Of course -- Brahms!
			A piano etude...
			No, that's corny. Probably
			everybody tries that...
			computer... how about... guitar.
			Classical guitar. Anybody.
			Come on in!
			Oh, you changed...
			Well, you know the uniform is
			so... formal...
			You're less formal than any
			Starfleet officer I've ever met,
			Lieutenant.
			Am I? I just wanted to make
			you... feel more comfortable.
			I'm fine. Thank you.
			You know... your hair is
			different...
			Different than a few hours ago?
			No, no... I mean... different
			than... I expected. From your
			Starfleet records...
			Oh. Yes... I used to wear it
			up...
			Why would you need to see my
			personnel file... ?
			It's just... standard procedure
			for guests coming aboard...
			protocol.
			Nothing specific... actually.
			Please. Sit down. Would you like
			anything to drink?
			No, thank you.
			Commander La Forge... if I seem
			to you somewhat... unyielding...
			in my views -- it's because I care
			so very much about my work.
			I know that.
			Well, to be honest, some people
			find me cold, cerebral, lacking
			in humor...
			I'm sure they're wrong.
			Well, I... try... not to be that
			way. But when it comes to my
			designs, to my engines...
			especially the ones on the
			Enterprise...
			... they're like your children.
			Yes... exactly...
			So naturally you're a little
			possessive about them.
			You -- understand that?
			Sure. I feel a little like that
			myself.
			That's amazing. I don't think
			anyone has ever...
			Sometimes I'm more comfortable
			with engine schematics than with
			people.
			Maybe you just haven't met the
			right people.
			I'm starving... why don't we have
			some dinner.
			Commander --
			Please. Call me Geordi.
			I'm sorry, I hope you didn't
			go to a lot of trouble, but I
			can't stay.
			You can't --?
			I just don't feel it's
			appropriate.
			I'll meet you at oh-eight-hundred
			tomorrow. I'm preparing a list
			of the discrepancies I've
			identified in your modifications.
			I hope -- now that we've reached
			an understanding -- that you'll
			be prepared to discuss them with
			me in a more objective fashion.
			Well, sure...
			Thank you. Good night, Commander.
			Computer -- turn up the damn
			lights. And get rid of that
			stupid guitar.
			This new concentration of energy
			was detected only after the
			surrounding material became
			inert.
			Could this be some sort of...
			tissue regeneration?
			The radiation signature is similar
			to the original pattern, but there
			are significant differences.
			Some kind of reaction to our
			phaser fire, perhaps...
			I believe this is separate and
			self-contained within the body
			of the dead lifeform.
			Another entity... ?
			Yessir. It appears to be a
			smaller, less developed version
			of the original creature.
			No wonder it attacked us. It
			was about to give birth.
			It's dangerous to generalize about
			new lifeforms... but based on my
			experience with other beings that
			bear their young in this manner,
			I'd say the offspring is still
			premature. Otherwise, it would
			be able to break through the outer
			body shell of the parent.
			Will this... child be able to
			survive on its own without the
			parent?
			There's no way to tell. We don't
			have enough information about the
			bio-functions of the adult, much
			less the child.
			Is there something we can do to
			help?
			If we were in Sickbay, I'd try
			a Cesarean section... the first
			priority is to free it from the
			parent's body.
			We could use our phasers like a
			scalpel...
			Yes... that might work...
			I advise against this, Captain.
			The parent proved to be a threat
			to the ship... we do not know how
			the offspring will react.
			Your objection is noted... but
			we are directly responsible for
			the death of the parent. We
			cannot simply walk away now.
			We'll proceed at your discretion,
			Doctor.
			Good morning!
			Morning.
			The first thing I'd like to do
			is inspect the power transfer
			conduits.
			You realize the only way to
			inspect them is to crawl inside...
			I designed them, Commander... I
			know what's involved.
			Watch out for the power taps.
			The acoustic signature doesn't
			sound right.
			You're probably the only other
			person in the galaxy who could
			pick that up.
			What's causing it?
			It's right up here.
			I've never seen anything like
			this... what is it?
			A mid-range phase adjuster... it
			puts the plasma back into phase
			after inertial distortion.
			This has never been done before.
			I don't think it's ever been
			conceived of before. You should
			write a scientific paper.
			That's not my strong suit,
			Doctor...
			But this kind of refinement should
			be shared... and you deserve the
			credit for it...
			Maybe we could collaborate.
			Writing is one of your strong
			points.
			Commander La Forge... ever since
			I came on board, there's been
			something a little peculiar in
			your attitude. You seem to know
			things about me even though we've
			never met.
			I... studied you. Your writings,
			your Starfleet file. I've admired
			you. Your work.
			I'm flattered, but...
			I've looked forward to meeting
			you for a long time...
			And I'd like to think -- that we
			could get to be friends. Good
			friends.
			I thought you knew... you seem
			to know everything else about
			me... but Commander... if I'm
			hearing what I think I am, then
			you should know... I'm married.
			Set phaser power to three percent,
			narrow beam.
			Three percent.
			All right... here we go.
			First incision is complete.
			Ideally, the offspring should be
			able to push through the outer
			shell on its own now.
			It needs a little more help.
			We've done all we can. I don't
			want to risk hitting the child
			by accident.
			Come on... you can do it...
			Captain, I'd like to announce the
			birth of a large baby...
			something.
			Well done, Doctor. Well done.
			A glitch, a malfunction in the
			holodeck... it's the only
			explanation I can think of... it's
			a miracle we ever got out of that
			booby-trap alive... how could it
			have been so far off? It was
			based on every piece of
			information on record about Leah
			Brahms... okay, with an admitted
			margin for error... but this is
			an error that's a light year
			wide...
			Not what you hoped for, huh?
			Hoped for... ? She's about as
			friendly as a Circassian Plague
			Cat... all she cares about is her
			work... she hates what I've done
			to her engines... and to top it
			off -- she's married! The
			computer never even told me she
			was married...
			Computer problem, huh...
			Must've been...
			Maybe it was your old VISOR...
			What are you talking about?
			The VISOR you wore on the holodeck
			with her.
			This is the same VISOR.
			Really? I figured you were
			wearing the one that lets you see
			what you want to see.
			What's that supposed to mean?
			You saw exactly what you wanted
			to see in the holodeck... Sure,
			the computer made it look like
			her, added personality... but
			when it came to your relationship
			together, you filled in the
			blanks...
			Here you had this perfectly
			wonderful fantasy... and now the
			real Leah comes along and ruins
			it.
			She's done the most heartless,
			despicable thing one person can
			do to another -- she didn't live
			up to your expectations.
			Take a hard look through your
			VISOR, La Forge... see her for
			who she really is... not what you
			want her to be.
			The lifeform's patterns are
			stable, Captain. It seems able
			to withstand the solar radiation
			without difficulty.
			Good.
			Ensign Rager, set course for the
			Guernica system.
			Aye, sir...
			We're not staying?
			No. We've done what we can to
			help... now it's time to move on.
			This... child will live the rest
			of its life without any further
			interference from us.
			It might be wise to put some
			distance between us before
			initiating the warp drive.
			Very well.
			Five hundred k.p.h., Ensign.
			Engage.
			Captain, it's following us...
			maintaining a distance of four
			kilometers directly astern.
			Seventeen degrees to port, Ensign
			Rager.
			Aye, sir.
			It's turning with us, sir.
			Increase to one half impulse.
			It is matching our velocity.
			It's imprinted on us.
			It thinks the Enterprise is...
			its mother.
			A change in energy readings, sir.
			I am reading an internal buildup
			of gamma particles in---
			Its velocity is increasing... it's
			moving directly toward the ship!
			Evasive maneuvers, full...
			Report...
			Minor damage...
			Sir, the creature is now in direct
			contact with the hull.
			On screen.
			Data?
			Sir, the lifeform is draining
			energy directly from the fusion
			reactors.
			Feeding off the energy of the
			Enterprise as it would from its
			mother.
			What action should we take,
			Captain?
			None, Lieutenant. None at all.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Since the newborn has attached
			itself to the hull, it has been
			making greater and greater demands
			on the ship's energy, but we have
			been able to temporarily stabilize
			our power systems.
			How long before the power drain
			becomes critical, Mister La Forge?
			If it continues to increase at
			the current rate, six, seven
			hours, maybe...
			We may be able to modify the
			engines to extend that a little
			longer, Captain.
			Your help would be appreciated,
			Doctor.
			By then, maybe Junior won't need
			us any more.
			Data, is there any way to
			determine what the destination
			of the parent might have been?
			I can attempt to extrapolate from
			the heading it was on when we
			encountered it, sir.
			Perhaps it was on the way to a
			safe and supportive environment
			for its newborn.
			We might be able to deliver it
			to the same destination.
			Which raises the question of how
			to get Junior off the hull when
			we get there...
			It's almost completely covering
			the door of shuttlebay two. If
			we open the door and deactivate
			the atmospheric force field...
			... the pressure from inside the
			ship might push it away from the
			hull.
			Make it so.
			Is the appellation "Junior" to
			be the lifeform's official name
			from now on?
			No. It's not.
			We can save a lot of energy just
			by improving engine efficiency...
			We've run into similar problems
			before... that's actually why
			I reoriented the dilithium
			crystal...
			And why you added that mid-range
			phase adjuster...
			Right.
			Commander... it seems you've made
			more modifications than I'm aware
			of. Do you have a file on all
			the work you've done?
			Sure. It's in the computer --
			Picard to La Forge...
			La Forge here...
			Commander, I need to see you on
			the Bridge.
			Yes, sir, be right there.
			You go ahead, Doctor... Ensign
			Pavlik can show you the file on
			the engine modifications.
			Phase coils upgraded to fifty-five
			field densities... plasma inducers
			interlinked with generator...
			Ensign, would there be any other
			files with data on the original
			engine specifications?
			I believe so, Doctor...
			This file utilizes the prototype
			engine schematic...
			It's a holographic program set
			in the drafting room at Utopia
			Planitia.
			Perfect. I'll run it on
			Holodeck Three.
			Computer... replay program
			Nine-One-Four-Zero... engine
			schematic at Utopia Planitia...
			Program loaded and ready.
			She went where?
			Holodeck Three, sir... I didn't
			think there was anything wrong
			with her seeing the file...
			Of course not... nothing at all...
			I'm with you every day, Geordi.
			Every time you look at this
			engine, you're looking at me.
			Every time you touch it, it's me.
			Computer, freeze program.
			Now... I understand...
			No, you don't... it wasn't the
			way it might look...
			I called up a replay of the
			program file. I was all ready
			to compliment you again,
			Commander... for constructing a
			program which contained the
			prototype engine... so you'd
			always have a base-line reference
			point for your modifications...
			And then I find... it's all about
			a -- fantasy plaything...
			It's not like that, I swear --
			I am outraged by this. I have
			been -- invaded. Violated. How
			dare you use me like this? How
			far did it go, anyway? Was it
			good for you?
			Nothing like that happened. It
			was a professional collaboration.
			Oh, I can tell -- "Every time you
			touch the engine, it's me... " Real
			professional.
			If you watched the whole program,
			you saw what it was... we worked
			together to solve a problem. In
			a crisis situation --
			How do I know that's all there
			was? What other programs did you
			create? You could have dozens
			of them, one for every day of the
			week, one for every mood --
			Ever since you came on board,
			you've been badgering me... and
			I've taken it. I've shown you
			courtesy, and respect, and a hell
			of a lot of patience. I've tried
			to understand you and I've tried
			to get along with you...
			And in return, you've accused me,
			tried and convicted me without
			bothering to hear my side of it.
			So -- I'm guilty, okay? But not
			of what you think... of something
			much worse...
			I'm guilty of reaching out to
			you... of hoping we could
			connect... I'm guilty of a
			terrible crime, Doctor -- I
			offered you friendship.
			Its total volume has increased
			by eight point five percent in
			the last three hours. I am now
			reading it as forty-six million
			cubic meters. (TECH)
			Captain, I have completed the
			analysis of the parent's course
			through this system.
			It was heading for an asteroid
			belt...
			Ensign Rager, set course two five
			nine mark three one eight, one
			half impulse.
			Aye, sir.
			Hold position five hundred
			kilometers from the periphery of
			the asteroid field...
			Aye, sir.
			Difficulty getting a clear sensor
			reading beyond four thousand
			kilometers.
			The asteroids contain large
			quantities of meklinite, which
			is interferring with our scanners.
			I am also detecting traces of
			Kefnium, a compound which was
			found in the parent being's outer
			shell. It is likely that the
			asteroids provide sustenance for
			this lifeform.
			We could leave the child here.
			If Data's right, it would have
			an ample supply of food.
			Agreed.
			Mister La Forge, are you ready
			to separate our guest from the
			hull?
			Ready, Captain.
			Proceed.
			I'm deactivating the atmospheric
			force field now, Captain.
			Engineering, report!
			The power drain just jumped to
			ninety-three percent, sir.
			Captain, the offspring is emitting
			a high frequency radio
			transmission.
			Is it trying to communicate?
			The power drain is increasing...
			approaching auto-shutdown.
			Take the engines off-line.
			Supplement with auxiliary power.
			All decks go to emergency
			condition seven. Life support
			and critical operations only.
			Mister La Forge, what is your
			status?
			I'm sorry, Captain... the bay's
			been completely depressurized,
			but... it's still hanging on.
			I am detecting other radio
			transmissions, Captain.
			Sensors detecting movement within
			the asteroid field... distance,
			two million kilometers, bearing
			two-five-seven mark one-six-one.
			On screen.
			At their current speed, the
			entities will intercept us in
			ten minutes, thirty-one seconds.
			Weapons status?
			Auxiliary power only... two
			seconds phaser fire available.
			Ensign... power readings.
			We're on auxiliary generators...
			life support is functioning,
			that's about all...
			Keep your eye on the generator
			console. We've got less than
			six minutes to get that baby off
			our back before his relatives
			get here...
			Whatever we try, junior responds
			by sucking up more energy...
			I have a thought, Commander...
			If you're interested...
			Of course. What is it?
			If the baby is nursing, perhaps
			what we need -- is to find a way
			to sour the milk.
			I'm listening.
			If we could contaminate the energy
			he's feeding on...
			... make it unpalatable somehow...
			... but the emergency generators
			are all we've got...
			... and how do we modify them
			without losing life support?
			Exactly... unless...
			What?
			This is a space baby, right? I
			mean, these creatures are born,
			live, and die in interstellar
			space?
			Apparently...
			Okay. All matter in space
			vibrates in a specific radiation
			band...
			Twenty-one centimeters...
			That's good, Commander, that's
			very good. We could alter the
			power frequency so it's completely
			foreign to the lifeform's natural
			vibrations...
			And that might be just enough to
			pour a little vinegar in baby's
			milk.
			We'll have to be careful... if
			we upset it this time, we might
			lose auxiliary power too.
			If we're gradual enough, it won't
			be a shock. Hopefully it'll just
			lose interest.
			La Forge to Bridge...
			Go ahead.
			Doctor Brahms and I have a plan,
			Captain.
			Two minutes until the creatures
			intercept, sir.
			Captain, we're ready down here.
			Proceed.
			Lowering wavelength in the energy
			system, now...
			Reading eighteen... fifteen...
			thirteen... eleven... eight...
			five... three... now at the two
			centimeter level...
			Any reaction, Bridge?
			Negative. I detect no reduction
			in the lifeform's rate of energy
			consumption.
			One minute thirty seconds to
			intercept.
			Okay... not sour enough. Leah,
			take it down further.
			Reading one... point eight...
			point four... point two...
			I guess it noticed what we're
			doing.
			The lifeform is emitting its high
			frequency transmission... energy
			consumption is rising...
			Captain -- the creatures are
			accelerating their approach...
			they're changing color!
			Mister La Forge --
			Just a little more time,
			Captain--!
			Nudge it down... toward
			point-oh-two...
			Intercept in thirty seconds.
			Point oh-eight... oh-five...
			oh-three... now at point oh-two
			centimeters...
			Auxiliary generators are losing
			power, Captain...
			The entity has disengaged, sir.
			Power returning to normal levels,
			Captain.
			Bring the engines on line. And
			take us out of here.
			Mister La Forge... Doctor
			Brahms... congratulations. You
			have weaned the baby.
			Good work.
			You, too.
			Yeah... yeah, I'll admit... I did
			get a little... attached to that
			lady in the holodeck...
			The computer never told you that
			I was married...
			I never asked... and the computer
			is notorious for not volunteering
			information... tell me about
			him...
			My husband? His name is
			Michael... he's an engineer on
			Garran-four...
			... you'd like him.
			I'm sure...
			You remind me of him actually.
			I do?
			I really owe you an apology,
			Geordi.
			No you don't. I should have told
			you straight out...
			But if you had, I never would've
			seen the look on your face when
			you walked in on me... and me...
			in the holodeck...
			The look on my face... ? The look
			on your face, I'll remember that
			a long time.
			I wouldn't change a thing...
			Except the way I behaved... I
			guess I came here with my own set
			of preconceptions about you...
			I'm just glad I finally got the
			chance to know you... the real
			you.
			Me too.
			Tell me... am I... really that
			different than my image in the
			holodeck?
			Not so different... not so
			different at all.
			Worf to La Forge... there's an
			incoming message on subspace for
			Doctor Brahms...
			My husband...
			Acknowledged, Worf. La Forge
			out.
