			Captain's log, Stardate 44631.2.
			We are proceeding through the
			uncharted rim of a binary star
			system, where we may have located
			the U.S.S. Brattain. The missing
			science vessel failed to arrive
			at its destination and has not
			been heard from since a distress
			call twenty-nine days ago.
			Magnify.
			It's the Brattain, all right.
			The ship is intact, sir, with no
			indications of structural damage.
			Engines?
			All propulsion systems are shut
			down. The ship is drifting.
			Life form readings?
			Inconclusive, sir.
			Counselor?
			There is life on board... but...
			What is it?
			I don't know... something...
			Number One, assemble your team.
			Doctor Crusher, report to
			Transporter Room Three.
			Data, Worf...
			Commander... I need to go, also...
			There is no indication of
			malfunction in any of the main
			systems.
			Here's another one.
			This was done by a phaser... at
			a setting of six or seven...
			There are more over here...
			The entire Bridge crew...
			Whoever did this... may still be
			on board.
			There's someone alive... but he
			didn't kill these people...
			Here...
			He's alive...
			I think he is Betazoid...
			It's all right. We're going to
			help you.
			What happened here? Who did this
			to you?
			We're almost finished with the
			autopsies, Captain.
			How long will it take you to
			compile the data?
			It's complicated -- the dead were
			found everywhere... some locked
			in their rooms -- barricaded, with
			weapons piled around them... some
			in corridors where they'd
			obviously had hand-to-hand
			combat... I'll have to sort
			through and analyze the details.
			We've identified him as Andrus
			Hagan, from Betazed, science
			advisor. He's in a profound
			catatonic state.
			I'm not getting much, Captain...
			a few words, disconnected phrases.
			I can feel his terror... but I
			can't seem to reach him.
			Don't give up on him, Counselor.
			We're examining the Brattain for
			clues -- but this man is the only
			one left who knows what happened
			there.
			I'm here. I'm right here.
			There's nothing to be afraid of
			anymore.
			... out there... voices...
			You hear voices? What do they
			say?
			... both things... no... no...
			Keep talking to me... I'll try
			to understand...
			All engines check out perfectly,
			Commander. Once we get them
			started up, the Brattain can get
			back to Starbase under her own
			power.
			Let's give it a try.
			Pre-heating injectors... Data,
			fuel flow?
			Matter valves are open and
			operating. Magnetic containment
			on the anti-matter pods is
			constant.
			Okay, open injectors.
			Injectors open.
			There is no engine activity at
			all.
			What's wrong, Geordi?
			Nothing's wrong. I don't
			understand it.
			Come.
			I've been studying the autopsy
			reports... the conclusion is
			appalling.
			There was no outside source...
			no alien presence... The crew of
			the Brattain, all thirty-four of
			them -- appear to have killed each
			other.
			What could have caused such an
			event? Drugs? A virus?
			Poison...
			Toxicological tests showed no
			unusual substances in their
			systems. And they were in good
			health.
			But for whatever reason, they seem
			to have turned against each other,
			using phasers, knives -- and bare
			hands.
			I'd like you to see this, Captain.
			It's from the logs of the
			Brattain. Captain Zaheva's mental
			condition deteriorated steadily
			after they became stranded... she
			began talking of plots and
			mutinies...
			This is the last entry... made
			after they had been adrift for
			over three weeks.
			First Officer Brink and his men
			were behind it... they got to the
			engines... don't work anymore...
			had to eliminate Brink... the
			ship is out of... out of... we're
			running out... too dangerous...
			out of Brink... and his men...
			Be sure to call me if there's any
			change in his condition. I'll
			be in my office.
			Where are you?
			I'm coming. Where are you?
			Eyes... in the dark... one moon...
			circles...
			See the eyes... in the dark...
			one moon...
			Where are you?!
			Captain's log, Stardate 44635.8:
			Four days have passed, but we have
			made little progress in solving
			the mystery of the Brattain. I
			have decided we will return to
			Starbase Two-twenty...
			... and to that end, Commander La
			Forge is rigging the Brattain for
			towing.
			I'm going to try re-calibrating
			the field generators. I still
			don't see why we can't get the
			engines going... it just doesn't
			make any sense.
			Someone's still here...
			They're alive!
			Ensign... what is it?
			Can't you hear it? There's
			someone left alive on the ship!
			I heard... I mean, I thought I
			heard something.
			The ship was searched thoroughly.
			There's no one left aboard.
			Sorry, sir. My mistake.
			Thirty-four people were found dead
			on this ship. That could make
			anyone uneasy.
			Thank you, sir.
			I'm here... can you hear me?
			Tell me about the voices you
			hear...
			Bright... one pole... two
			poles...
			I don't understand... tell me more
			about the poles...
			Boy, what a day this was... I'm
			doing an isozyme study on some
			populations of Cardilia... but
			they're turning out to have some
			really weird polymorphisms.
			What a headache!
			Is that why you were late?
			Oh, no, I had a conference with
			Doctor Balthus... she wants to
			do a study on the laticifer
			ontogeny of the Kaladian Thorn
			Flower... but I don't have the
			time to oversee another project...
			Was Tom Corbin there?
			What?
			Tom Corbin. From the science lab.
			Remember him?
			Of course I remember him, but --
			You use any excuse to pay him a
			visit...
			Miles... what are you saying--?
			I think you know exactly what I'm
			saying.
			If I didn't know better... I'd
			say you're jealous.
			You take me for a fool?
			Hello, Chief... have some coffee?
			I've been drinking too much
			coffee... maybe some hot tea,
			Guinan?
			Coming up.
			Kind of a surprise to see you
			in here at this hour.
			How's that?
			You're not out of the honeymoon
			yet... usually newlyweds can't
			keep their hands off each other...
			She has work to do. She heads
			up the plant biology lab, you
			know.
			Any strange things going on down
			there?
			Like what?
			I've been hearing things...
			Kenicki, in Engineering... told
			me he saw a man in an old
			Starfleet uniform... riding the
			lift near the engine core... but
			when the lift got to the top...
			there was no one on it...
			Ghost stories...
			There's more... lots more.
			Strange things are happening on
			this ship, O'Brien...
			I'm surprised at you, Gillespie...
			a Starfleet officer...
			I have more to worry about than
			shades and spirits...
			Come.
			Come.
			Come...
			Captain, do you have a moment?
			We're concerned... whatever
			happened on the Brattain -- may be
			starting here.
			Explain...
			Beverly and I have both gotten
			unusual reports... people behaving
			strangely... others hearing
			sounds that aren't there...
			Are we talking about
			hallucinations?
			In some cases. In others -- just
			erratic behavior.
			We can't track down any common
			element that might be responsible.
			But everything started when we
			found the Brattain...
			Yes. Captain -- we have to get
			the Enterprise away from here...
			before it gets worse...
			We are preparing to take the
			Brattain in tow. We'll be on our
			way within the hour.
			Ensign, maneuver us into position
			within tractor beam range.
			Aye, sir...
			Is there a problem, Ensign?
			I... can't seem to remember how
			to enter the coordinates, sir...
			Ready now, Captain.
			Ensign Rager, report to Sickbay.
			Yes, sir...
			Ensign Lin, put us into position
			to engage the tractor beam.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf, ready tractor beam.
			Ensign... we are losing
			maneuverability. Did you throttle
			down by mistake?
			No, sir.
			Captain... thrusters are losing
			power.
			Impulse engines... ahead minimum
			power.
			Impulse engines are not
			responding, sir.
			Riker to Engineering... what's
			going on down there?
			I don't know, sir... nothing's
			responding...
			Ensign, go to warp engines --
			factor one. Engage.
			Captain, we don't have warp drive
			either!
			Data, do we have any propulsion
			system that is functional?
			No, sir. Apparently we do not.
			We're adrift...
			Just like the Brattain.
			Captain's log, Stardate 44639.9.
			We have now been adrift for a
			total of ten days. We have sent
			sub-space distress calls, but
			because of our distant location,
			we cannot expect a response for
			at least another two weeks.
			After analyzing the sensor logs
			from the Brattain and the
			Enterprise, as well as the data
			from our last series of probes,
			I have concluded that...
			... we have become trapped in a
			massive rupture in space...
			undetectable by normal means...
			into which energy is absorbed.
			You mean... a Tyken's Rift...
			A what?
			A rare anomaly named for Bela
			Tyken, the Melthusian Captain who
			first encountered it.
			A Tyken's Rift -- of course...
			that would explain why we don't
			have engine power.
			The ship's energy is being drained
			into the fissure before we can
			utilize it.
			I was detained.
			When Tyken was trapped in a Rift,
			his analysis determined that a
			massive energy release might
			overload and dislocate the
			anomaly. Fortunately, his cargo
			included anicium and yurium, which
			he used to detonate a massive
			explosion. He then escaped
			through the ruptured center of
			the Rift.
			But we aren't carrying anything
			that could produce that kind of
			explosion. Even our photon
			torpedoes wouldn't be enough.
			Can't we replicate the elements
			Tyken used?
			We no longer have the power to
			reproduce complex elements with
			our replicators. We must find
			a way to generate a violent energy
			release without relying on
			conventional means.
			Data... in Tyken's experience...
			did the crew exhibit behavioral
			changes?
			No. There were no reports of
			unusual conduct among the crew.
			What about nightmares?
			There was no record of sleep
			distubances of any kind,
			Counselor.
			Then -- what is it? What's
			happening to us?
			So far, the only one who doesn't
			seem affected by all this is
			Data...
			Bridge.
			Number One... how... are you?
			Sir?
			Any hallucinations? Nightmares?
			No... but I'd be a liar if I said
			I felt like myself... I bite my
			tongue to keep from snapping at
			people... and a couple of times,
			when I've gone into my quarters...
			... I've felt as though... there's
			someone in there... waiting for
			me...
			It's affecting all of us. I've
			-- had similar feelings...
			With everyone around us
			succumbing... it's even more
			important that at least one of
			us stay in control of his
			faculties. I want you to turn
			in... take a nap. I'll be on the
			Bridge and you can relieve me in
			four hours.
			All right, sir. Deck Eight.
			No! No!
			No... stop... no...
			Sir... ?
			As you were.
			Mister Data... in my Ready Room,
			please...
			Sir, Commander La Forge and I have
			come up with a potential solution
			to our predicament. Perhaps the
			modifications we used to increase
			firepower against the Borg might
			be effective here.
			Channeling power into the main
			deflector dish...
			I believe within six hours we
			can generate a concentrated burst
			of energy which might disrupt the
			Tyken's Rift.
			Very well. Proceed.
			Mister Data...
			Sir?
			Apparently... I am not immune...
			to the strange forces at work on
			this ship...
			Yes, sir.
			It's a frightening prospect...
			to lose control of your mind...
			When I was young, I saw my
			grandfather deteriorate... from
			a powerful, robust figure... to
			a -- a frail wisp of a man, who
			couldn't even remember how to make
			his way home...
			It is my responsibility...
			somehow... to see that this ship
			is guided to safety. I will have
			to rely on you, from now on...
			We may need to count on you for
			our very survival.
			Yes, sir. I will do my best.
			I want to do more cross-sections
			on the brain tissue of some of
			these bodies. Set up the positron
			emission sensors in Sickbay...
			I'll decide which ones I want to
			study.
			Go away.
			Captain, let me ask you this:
			since we located the Brattain...
			can you remember any of your
			dreams?
			I hardly ever remember dreams...
			A lot of people don't... but
			think... have you had a dream in
			the last ten days?
			I... don't recall...
			I'm betting you haven't. What's
			more, neither has anyone else on
			board this ship -- except Troi.
			I began to realize it when she
			talked about her nightmares.
			I've done additional brain tissue
			tests on some of the bodies from
			the... the...
			The Brattain...
			... and scans on a random
			cross-section of our crew. They
			all show the same result... a
			unique chemical imbalance.
			Caused by -- ?
			Dream deprivation.
			Every night... we... we enter
			into... sleep...
			I believe the Doctor means to say
			that humans enter what is known
			as REM sleep... rapid eye
			movement. It is the level of
			brain-wave activity at which you
			dream.
			We need dreams to survive... if
			we don't get REM sleep, we don't
			dream, and we begin to lose our
			-- cognitive abilities... it
			becomes hard to concentrate...
			we forget... how to do the most
			ordinary task.
			Then... we become irritable...
			paranoid... some people
			experience hallucinations...
			You're describing the situation
			on this ship... But Counselor
			Troi has reported nightmares...
			Maybe it's because she's Betazoid.
			I don't know... but there's
			something more going on here than
			being stuck in a Tyken's Rift...
			and I don't know how or why it's
			happening...
			But I do know this. There is an
			inevitable conclusion to this
			pattern. If I can't find a way
			to reverse it -- we are all going
			to go insane.
			Where are you... ?
			Eyes... in the dark... one moon
			circles...
			I'm still here... I haven't gone
			anywhere...
			Do you remember anything more?
			...double... double...
			What does that mean? Is something
			doubled?
			Deanna... Nothing's working...
			I've tried somatic drugs, I've
			tried inducing theta waves in the
			entorhinal cortex... no matter
			what I do, no one can reach REM
			sleep. No one can dream... except
			you...
			Except me... And all I have is
			nightmares... I can barely sleep
			at all anymore.
			In the end... I'll be like him.
			Just like him.
			I think... it's some kind of
			experiment... Captain Picard
			wants to see how we'll take it,
			stuck here like rats...
			You couldn't be more wrong...
			It's like we're laboratory
			animals... I don't want to sit
			and wait for death to sneak up
			behind me...
			What's that supposed to mean?
			You heard about them on the
			Brattain... shut in their
			rooms... dying alone... that's
			not for me. I'd rather go out
			fighting...
			Okay... all power has been
			channelled to the... the...
			I can't remember what it's called.
			The main deflector dish...
			Yes... so, now what do we do?
			We must coordinate our effort with
			the Bridge.
			Data to Bridge...
			Yes...
			We are ready to discharge the main
			deflector, Captain.
			All right...
			Mister Worf -- activate the
			deflector.
			Deflector power coils
			charging...
			Peeples...
			Security to Engineering.
			You've been changing the reactant
			mix... that's why we're stuck
			here...
			Deflector powerbanks approaching
			maximum. Discharge in fifteen
			seconds.
			Confine Ensign Peeples to
			Sickbay.
			I'll tell everyone what you're
			doing, Commander...
			Data... this detonation better
			work... we aren't gonna last much
			longer...
			Discharge in three seconds...
			two... one...
			Nothing... it just fizzled out...
			The energy output was absorbed
			into the Rift.
			Data... can we try again?
			No, sir. If we draw more power,
			we risk losing life-support
			systems.
			lujpu' jiH'e, Alexandrijn.
			Worf, no!
			You will not stop me...
			Security to Lieutenant Worf's
			quarters, immediately...
			No one will stop me...
			Why, Worf? What is it?
			I am no longer a warrior... I am
			no longer strong... I feel...
			What is it you feel?
			Worf stares at her, agonizing. The admission is almost
			too overwhelming for him.
			I feel... fear.
			Worf... to admit that you are
			afraid... gives you strength.
			Something is waiting for us...
			I am not strong enough to fight
			it...
			No, Worf. It is just an illusion.
			It is not real.
			Please... put down the knife.
			It's all right. Everything is
			fine. Thank you.
			Let me take you to Sickbay.
			Acting Captain's log, stardate
			44642.1. I have assumed command
			of the Enterprise at the request
			of Captain Picard. Our situation
			is deteriorating; many of the crew
			are unable to function and our
			life support systems are beginning
			to falter.
			Once before... you said
			"double"... what did you mean?
			What is double?
			...mates... too bright... a --
			twin... cannot leave the twin...
			one moon circling...
			... what do you mean... you can't
			leave?
			No, no... please... can't...
			You want to leave? Why can't you?
			Can't go... help... one moon
			circling... eyes... that's it...
			eyes... in the dark... can't
			leave...
			Eyes in the dark... that's what
			the voice said in my dream.
			Is that where you heard it? In
			a dream? Over and over... ?
			Beverly... I know what it is...
			I know what's happening...
			What... ?
			My nightmare... it's not a dream.
			It's not a dream at all... it's
			a message.
			REM sleep occurs at a different
			frequency for Betazoids than other
			humanoids... I believe these
			beings are using that frequency
			to communicate telepathically...
			It is conceivable that this
			telepathic communication is
			creating an interference that
			prevents REM sleep in other
			species -- that would be an
			explanation for why the rest
			of the crew is not dreaming.
			Counselor... what are these --
			beings -- trying to tell us?
			They're calling for help. I think
			they're trapped just like we are.
			"Eyes in the dark"... could mean
			this twin star system...
			Your hypothesis is certainly
			plausible.
			It may well be that there is
			another ship... on the other side
			of the fissure... where we
			cannot detect it.
			Is there any way... to block their
			signals?
			We have no technology to block
			telepathic transmissions, Doctor.
			Maybe... communication through
			dreams can work both ways... I
			could try to get them to stop...
			Perhaps we can accomplish more
			than that. If we could coordinate
			our efforts with these beings...
			we might work together to free
			ourselves.
			It is conceivable... in working
			with patients who have
			debilitating nightmares, I have
			often used a therapetuic treament
			known as "directed dreaming"...
			Dreamers can learn to take control
			of their dreams... retain a
			conscious memory... even while
			they're in REM sleep. I should
			be able to remember a short
			message.
			If it's... possible... what would
			you say... ?
			What we must discover is a means
			by which, working together with
			the aliens, we can produce an
			explosion more intense than either
			of us could achieve alone.
			What is it you're looking for?
			These are the elements we have
			available. Some of them could
			be used in the creation of an
			explosive reaction. If we can
			communicate this inventory to
			the other ship, perhaps they will
			be able to --
			No, Data... that's too complex.
			This has to be a simple, clear
			message...
			I am uncertain if a simple
			transmission will be adequate...
			Stop... go back...
			Further back... there. Stop.
			"One... moon... circles... "
			Yes, Counselor, one electron
			circles one proton... this is a
			hydrogen atom.
			"One moon circles"... that's what
			they have been telling me... over
			and over...
			Perhaps the aliens are thinking
			as we are... to collaborate in
			producing an explosion. If
			hydrogen is combined with certain
			elements... calendenium, for
			example, it is extremely volatile.
			But... would the message mean they
			have hydrogen... or want
			hydrogen?
			If it is a distress call, they'd
			be asking for what they need...
			not what they already have.
			Then a proper course of action
			would be for us to release
			hydrogen into the Rift and hope
			that they have a substance which
			could detonate it.
			How do I tell them what to do?
			If you are correct, Counselor,
			I believe they have already told
			us what to do... and are waiting
			for us to do it. When we are
			ready the only message you should
			try to convey is, "Now!"
			I can help keep you in REM sleep
			for a while with this cortical
			scanner... it will maintain
			electrical activity in your brain
			at the proper frequencies...
			Counselor. You will have to
			communicate with the other ship
			within two minutes of entering
			REM sleep.
			Two minutes, is that all, Data?
			Unfortunately, yes. We have only
			enough power to emit a hydrogen
			stream for that period of time.
			They must understand that they
			have to detonate it immediately.
			Sir, we are ready to implement
			the plan.
			Proceed.
			We will need to draw power from
			the life support systems in order
			to discharge the collectors.
			This is Acting Captain Data. All
			personnel will report to
			designated shelter areas
			immediately...
			... life support systems will
			continue only in emergency shelter
			areas...
			Hear that? ... get us jammed into
			shelter areas... we sit and wait
			to die... nobody'll ever find
			us...
			You can all relax... Ten Forward
			is a designated shelter area.
			Do we want to die here... like
			helpless children?
			Security to Ten-Forward... right
			away.
			We don't even know what we're
			dying for...
			Gillespie, sit down... you're not
			helping matters any...
			What's wrong with... standing up
			for ourselves?
			I say... Captain owes us some
			answers... let's go...
			Hold it.
			What's that... ?
			It's a little souvenir I picked
			up on Magus Three...
			Stand aside, Guinan... I'm not
			feeling so good and I don't have
			much patience...
			That's setting number one.
			Now...
			... anybody want to see number two?
			I'm not feeling so good myself...
			in fact, I'm real irritable...
			so I hope nobody's got the idea
			they're going through this door.
			Because they'll have to go through
			me first.
			PGO signals steady... visual
			cortex is showing increased
			activity... rapid eye movements
			commencing...
			Crusher to Bridge... she's in REM
			sleep...
			Thank you, Doctor.
			Activating the Bussard collectors.
			Where are you?
			Eyes... in the dark...
			We have ninety seconds remaining.
			Where are you... ?
			How is she, Doctor?
			Still in REM sleep...
			And how are you?
			...I'm... fine...
			Where are you? I have to
			find you... I have to tell
			you...
			Forty-five seconds remaining.
			Please... I must find you... tell
			you...
			Thirty seconds...
			Ten seconds.
			Nothing... no explosion...
			The Counselor was unsuccessful.
			Activate impulse engines...
			Engines activated, sir...
			We have cleared the rift, sir.
			Warp engines are coming back on
			line.
			Set a course...
			Setting a course for Starbase
			Two-twenty. Sir, as my final
			duty as Acting Captain, I order
			you to bed. I shall do the same
			for all personnel.
			Very well, Mister Data...
			And... thank you.
			Yes, sir. Pleasant dreams.
