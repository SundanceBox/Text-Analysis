			Captain's log, stardate 44995.3.
			We are en route to the Klingon
			Home World, where I will
			participate in the installation
			ceremony of Gowron, the next
			designated Leader of the High
			Council.
			This visit should also provide
			an opportunity for one of my
			officers to correct... a grave
			injustice..
			Enter.
			Am I intruding?
			No, sir. My apologies, Captain...
			I can be back in uniform---
			That won't be necessary.
			I'm not here as your captain.
			I'm here as the person that stood
			with you before the High
			Council... your cha'DIch.
			We'll arrive at your Home World
			in less than a day.
			It is not yet time.
			That doesn't sound like the man
			who came to me a year ago...
			fiercely determined to return home
			and clear his father's name...
			or die trying.
			You accepted this... dishonor from
			the Council in order to hold the
			Empire together.
			The Empire survives. Isn't it
			time to confront the Council...
			to regain your family name and
			let the truth be known?
			I have been told... that patience
			is sometimes a more effective
			weapon than a sword.
			Patience is a... human virtue,
			one which I am proud to see you've
			taken to heart. But this
			situation may require a more...
			Klingon response.
			Your discommendation is a facade
			intended to protect men less
			honorable than you. It is a
			lie... and lies must be
			challenged.
			I have grown... weary of bearing
			this dishonor...
			We will be in orbit around your
			planet for at least two days...
			it may be some time before we
			return again. I would be
			favorably disposed to grant a
			leave should you request one.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Thank you, sir.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			We've been intercepted by the
			Klingon vessel Bortas. They claim
			to be our escort.
			No escort was scheduled.
			The Bortas is standing by,
			Captain.
			On screen.
			Gowron... this is an unexpected
			pleasure.
			I must speak with you, Picard.
			We have to move quickly if we are
			to be successful.
			Successful?
			Yes.
			In preventing a Klingon civil war.
			The family of Duras is massing
			support... they have many allies
			on the Council...
			But Duras died in disgrace. By
			Klingon tradition, his family
			should share in that disgrace.
			Their corruption has poisoned the
			Empire. Honor will soon have
			no meaning.
			Who speaks for his family now?
			Lursa and B'Etor... the sisters
			of Duras.
			And they would claim leadership
			of the Council?
			Women may not serve on the
			Council...
			Then how... ?
			I don't know. But they are
			plotting something. They have
			secured the loyalty of at least
			three fleet commanders.
			Their followers do not care about
			Duras' crimes. Lursa and B'etor
			are feared... and fear is power.
			I fail to see what I can do to
			assist...
			You were first chosen as arbiter
			of succession because no Klingon
			could be trusted. You accepted
			this duty... and you must see it
			through to the end. You must
			ensure my installation.
			I am prepared to report to the
			Council that only you have
			completed the rite of
			succession...
			Not enough. Duras was a Romulan
			collaborator. You must declare
			his family ineligible to ever
			again sit on the ruling Council.
			That... is beyond my purview.
			You will not support me?
			I will not step outside the
			traditional role of the arbiter.
			And if they attempt to block my
			installation?
			I can only assure you that I will
			deal with any challenge according
			to Klingon law.
			I fear that will not be enough.
			Mister Worf, please escort our
			guest to the transporter room.
			Mister Data, begin monitoring
			Romulan activity along the Neutral
			Zone. Have the outpost stations
			there start sending us their
			tactical reports.
			Yes, sir.
			The Duras family is preparing to
			move against Gowron.
			Backed by Romulans?
			I don't know. But there's too
			much history between the Duras
			(note: plural) and the Romulans
			to discount the possibility.
			Dismissed.
			I would speak with you.
			I do not hear the words of a
			traitor.
			I am not a traitor.
			You admitted your guilt before
			the Council.
			I accepted discommendation to
			protect the Empire.
			Protect it? How?
			It was Duras' father who betrayed
			our people to the Romulans at
			Khitomer. Not mine.
			Duras. There is proof of this?
			There is.
			Why would you accept dishonor
			to protect Duras?
			His family was too powerful. To
			expose him would have split the
			Empire. Instead, the Council
			chose to blame my father.
			The Council knew?
			I believe you are a man of honor,
			Gowron.
			I ask you to restore my family
			name.
			Worf, you killed Duras. I
			consider that no small favor.
			But what you ask is impossible.
			But after your Installation...
			The grasp of Duras reaches out
			from the grave. Much of the
			Council is still loyal to his
			family. I must have the
			Council's support to survive.
			I cannot expose their treachery.
			You chose to accept this disgrace
			for the good of the Empire. Now,
			you must live with your decision
			like a Klingon.
			Guinan?
			Hi. Ten Forward's been pretty
			quiet today... I thought I'd get
			in a little target practice. Mind
			if I join you?
			You... practice?
			Sure. I like to keep my eye
			sharp.
			I... practice at... level
			fourteen.
			That's okay. I can go back to
			that level for a while.
			You know, I have a bet with the
			captain that I can make you smile
			before you make lieutenant
			commander.
			Not a good bet today.
			Ready?
			Computer, level fourteen... begin
			program.
			Program initiated.
			I'm sure I heard you laugh
			once... I liked it...
			Klingons don't laugh.
			Not true. Not true at all. You
			may not laugh. But believe me,
			I've heard some Klingon belly
			laughs that could shake a room.
			Your son laughs and he's Klingon.
			He's a child. And part human.
			Oh, that's right and you're not.
			You're all Klingon. Except you
			don't laugh.
			I don't laugh because I don't feel
			like laughing.
			But other Klingons feel like
			laughing. What does that say
			about you... ?
			Perhaps it says... I do not feel
			like other Klingons.
			Program complete.
			Good game.
			Hey, don't feel bad... I was
			doing this years before you were
			born.
			How is he, by the way? Your son.
			He is having some... difficulties
			adjusting to life on Earth.
			Must be tough for a little guy
			like that... living with humans,
			being Klingon... it has to get
			confusing sometimes...
			It will not be easy for him...
			No, it won't. But the time will
			come when he'll have to find out
			what it really means to be
			Klingon...
			Just as the time has come now for
			you, Worf.
			Come.
			Captain, I request a leave of
			absence.
			Mister Worf... request granted.
			Thank you, sir.
			Mister Worf...
			Qapla!
			And good luck.
			Lieutenant Worf, personal log,
			stardate 44996.1. I have located
			the Klingon ship on which my
			brother Kurn serves as captain
			and have arranged to join him.
			It has been too long, my brother.
			Too long.
			There is much to discuss. I have
			asked Gowron to restore our family
			honor. He has refused.
			No matter. Gowron will not live
			to see the day he leads the
			Council...
			What do you mean?
			He stands alone, surrounded by
			his enemies. Lursa and B-Etor
			will have him killed... and if
			they don't, I will.
			You will... ?
			Gowron is weak... and the family
			of Duras must never be allowed
			to lead the Council. All of our
			leaders... have failed us. They
			no longer deserve our loyalty.
			It is time to sweep away the old
			Council... and put a new one in
			its place.
			How could this be done?
			I already have the support of four
			squadron commanders in strategic
			sectors. When the time comes,
			they will follow me.
			Join us, Worf... we will usher
			in a new era, and regain our
			family name.
			No.
			What?
			Gowron has completed the rite of
			succession... it is our duty to
			support him.
			Gowron spits in your face when
			you ask him to give back what is
			rightfully ours... and you would
			support him?
			We cannot regain honor by acting
			dishonorably.
			I will not support Gowron.
			I am the elder brother, Kurn...
			I speak for our family.
			We will back Gowron.
			But not now. Not yet. We will
			wait. Until Gowron feels the
			grasp of his enemies around his
			throat. Then we will offer him
			our support. And the price will
			be the restoration of our family
			name.
			It will be difficult to convince
			my allies to back Gowron.
			But I will try. I must go to the
			Mempa sector and meet with the
			other squadron commanders.
			Contact me when you have gained
			their support.
			Then I will be ready for Gowron.
			naDev ghoS! (Come here!)
			Have you reached a decision
			regarding the succession of
			power?
			Qaja plu d'itch jung. La woq you
			ghir klas qimha. Gowron. Doj
			hon. Doj hon.
			Your Klingon is flawless, Picard.
			Not even a trace of a human
			accent. The Council thanks you
			for your service to the Empire.
			Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em.
			The arbiter confirms that you
			have completed the rite of
			succession. Your enemies have
			been destroyed. You stand alone.
			Do you wish to claim leadership
			of the Council?
			I wish it.
			Are there no other challengers?
			There is one.
			I will challenge him.
			An arrogant child!
			Who are you?
			I am Toral... son of Duras.
			Duras had no son!
			But he did...
			So, this is your doing...
			We wish to address the Council.
			Lursa, B'Etor, come forward.
			Members of the High Council, it
			is a day of great rejoicing for
			the family of Duras and the
			Klingon Empire. We have
			discovered that our brother did
			indeed have a son and heir.
			This is an outrage! Duras had
			no mate. Where did you find him,
			Lursa? In a harlot's bed
			chamber?
			I will personally cut your tongue
			out, Yintagh!
			Impudent wretch.
			A simple genetic scan will prove
			his bloodline is valid.
			The illegitimate son of Duras
			cannot rule the High Council.
			The Council will decide whether
			to accept the challenge of Toral,
			alleged son of Duras. In favor?
			Opposed.
			The challenge is accepted.
			The arbiter will consider its
			validity.
			Len'mat. (Adjourned)
			Our allies on the Council backed
			Toral's claim. It's in Picard's
			hands, now.
			Excellent. Everything is
			proceeding as scheduled.
			It will make matters simpler if
			the captain is cooperative... but
			we are prepared to move in any
			case.
			Why not just kill Picard?
			Fool! Do we want the Federation
			as our enemy?
			No.
			At least, not yet. But when the
			time is right... we will deal with
			the Federation... and Captain
			Picard.
			I have met with the other squadron
			commanders here... three will join
			us, one will not.
			That gives us enough strength to
			control seven key sectors.
			Do you know the strength of our
			enemies?
			They have at least seven
			squadrons... but most of the fleet
			has not decided which banner to
			follow.
			Gowron is nearly out of options.
			Soon he will have no choice...
			I will soon return to the Home
			World. We shall meet then.
			Do you also require the original
			logs recorded during the attack,
			Lieutenant?
			Everything we have on the
			Khitomer massacre.
			I can provide you with our
			analysis of communications between
			the Khitomer outpost and the
			Romulan ships; however, for a
			complete record you will have to
			contact Starbase Twenty-Four and
			request---
			Mister Worf... have you cancelled
			your leave?
			No, sir.
			Lieutenant... join me in my ready
			room.
			You are planning to use our files
			on the Khitomer massacre as
			evidence against Duras' father?
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Worf... do you not see an
			inherent conflict of interest...
			Sir, these records can help me
			prove that my father was falsely
			accused of treason.
			You are using your position as
			a Starfleet officer to affect
			political change on your
			planet... there could not be a
			worse compromise of our
			fundamental principles...
			Captain... you urged me to fight
			this battle...
			Yes, I know. I understand your
			motives, and you know I support
			your goals, but...
			Do not tie my hands now... I
			must be able to prove my father's
			innocence. The Federation records
			will do that.
			Mister Worf... Mister Worf...
			Mister Worf...
			Here I am lecturing you on a
			conflict of interest while I'm
			desperately trying to avoid one
			of my own. Do you think I wish
			to allow the Duras family to
			solidify their hold on the
			Council? Do you think I cannot
			see the implications for the
			Federation? And good Lord, Duras
			tried to have me killed!
			All of my instincts... my
			training... my very being as a
			Starfleet officer are at odds with
			my responsibilities as arbiter
			for the Klingon High Council.
			We walk the same tightrope between
			two worlds... you and I. We must
			try our very best to keep those
			worlds clearly separate... or we
			shall certainly fall.
			Yes, sir.
			As far as these records from
			Khitomer are concerned...
			I will make the Federation
			records on the Khitomer massacre
			available... to anyone who wants
			them... the High Council, the
			Duras family... anyone.
			Thank you, sir.
			Mister Worf, this is as far as
			I can go.
			Riker to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Number One.
			There's a message coming in for
			you from the surface. It's coded
			personal.
			Send it through.
			Welcome, Captain.
			Something to drink? Tea... Earl
			Grey, perhaps?
			Yes... thank you.
			You come... alone and unarmed...
			Nothing would be served by killing
			the arbiter before his decision.
			Nevertheless, a brave act,
			Captain.
			B'Etor...
			Your invitation was... unexpected.
			We should have extended it much
			sooner.
			We don't want you to judge us by
			your experience with our brother.
			Duras was a fool.
			He deserved to die.
			Forget him. We have.
			We do not wish to be your enemy.
			Quite the opposite.
			That... pleases me.
			Have you made a decision regarding
			Toral's challenge?
			I am pursuing it with all due
			vigilance.
			Let me heat your tea.
			Toral has the bloodline to lead
			the Empire into the next century.
			He has the support of the people.
			The remaining issue then is to
			see if he has the support of the
			law.
			But he must. Surely, you can see
			that.
			I'll tell you what I see. If I
			find Toral's challenge valid, the
			two of you will very quickly gain
			control of the Council... and
			Gowron will be found dead shortly
			thereafter. If I reject Toral's
			challenge, you will accuse me of
			doing it only to serve Federation
			interests. It will give you a
			rallying cry to declare war and
			overthrow Gowron.
			You see very clearly, Captain.
			But one thing is missing.
			If you rule against us and we are
			victorious in a war against
			Gowron...
			... which we would be...
			... it would mean the end of the
			alliance with the Federation.
			And we'd hate to see that happen
			as much as you would.
			This is not a threat, Captain.
			Just an unfortunate truth.
			So why be our enemy, when you can
			be our friend?
			You have manipulated the
			circumstances, ladies, with the
			skill of a Romulan.
			My decision will be announced at
			high sun tomorrow. Excellent tea.
			Good day.
			What is your decision?
			K'tal, this Council knows the law
			of heredity well. G'now juk Hol
			pajhard. A son will share in
			the honors or crimes of his
			father. Toral is Duras' son...
			that has been established by the
			genetic scan. And it is
			heartwarming to see him embraced
			by the family of Duras... for they
			are an old and noble family.
			But with due respect to the
			traditions and laws of this High
			Council, there is no basis for
			accepting a petition for
			leadership from a boy who has
			fought no battles, shed no blood
			for his people, earned no honor
			for himself. Perhaps some day
			he shall. But not now.
			Duras... is dead. His claim to
			the leadership died with him.
			Gowron will lead the Council.
			The arbiter has ruled. There
			are no more challengers.
			Does the Federation dictate
			Klingon destiny or do we? Follow
			me. And I will show you honor.
			Follow him and you reject all
			Klingon law...
			Can you not see what you are
			doing... are you blind to what
			they represent... are there so
			few noble Klingons left?
			Then go... your blood will paint
			the way to the future.
			Remember this day.
			Your message said it was urgent.
			What do you want?
			Your forces are weak, Gowron...
			you will need help to fight the
			family of Duras.
			From one dishonored Klingon...
			I offer you four Klingon
			squadrons.
			Why would they follow you... a
			Starfleet officer?
			They are pledged to support...
			my brother, Kurn.
			Kurn is your brother?
			His true bloodline was kept
			hidden to protect him.
			Kurn will follow me? He has
			opposed me in the past.
			I am the elder brother... he will
			do as I say.
			What is it you want in return?
			You know my price.
			The return of your honor. For
			the support of four squadrons... ?
			No, that will not be enough.
			The Duras family controls most
			of the fleet.
			We must have Federation help.
			They will not intervene.
			Perhaps not yet... but Starfleet
			Command will listen to Picard...
			and Picard listens to you.
			I can ask nothing more of him in
			this matter.
			What?
			My duty as a Starfleet officer---
			You come to me and demand the
			restoration of your family
			honor... and now you hide behind
			Human excuses!
			What are you, Worf? Do you
			tremble and quake with fear at
			the approach of combat... hoping
			to talk your way out of a fight...
			like a Human... or do you hear
			the cry of the warrior... calling
			you to battle... calling you to
			glory... like a Klingon?
			Are you one of us?
			Status!
			Aft shields down...
			Warp coils damaged...
			Report.
			We're still trying to sort it out.
			A Klingon Bird of Prey just
			decloaked and fired on the
			Bortas. Neither ship is answering
			our hail.
			Worf is still aboard the Bortas.
			A second Bird of Prey is
			decloaking bearing two-four-seven
			mark three-one-nine.
			Go to Red Alert.
			The second ship is joining the
			attack on the Bortas.
			It's begun.
			Send an emergency signal to any
			loyal ships!
			Impulse engines not responding!
			Engage emergency override!
			Override engaged! Disruptors
			still not responding!
			The Bortas is sustaining heavy
			damage, Captain. Her aft shields
			have collapsed... life support
			fluctuating...
			The Bortas should have twice the
			firepower of a Bird of Prey.
			Her weapons systems were hit
			pretty hard... they haven't
			brought them back on-line yet.
			The Bortas has lost its port
			shields... it is unlikely they
			will withstand another hit on that
			quarter.
			The Bortas has sent out a general
			distress signal.
			Ensign Reel... plot a course
			safely away from the combat area.
			Half impulse.
			Captain... the Bortas is Gowron's
			ship. If he's the legitimate
			leader of the Empire, shouldn't
			we help him?
			If we come to his aid... we'll
			be dragging the Federation into
			a Klingon civil war.
			What about Worf?
			Ensign... engage.
			The port shields are still down.
			Disruptors on-line!
			Lock on target.
			No!
			Their sensors will detect the
			weapons lock. If they think
			we're helpless, they'll try to
			board the ship.
			I can aim and fire disruptors
			manually when they drop their
			shields.
			GhoS! (Make it so!)
			Thirty-five thousand kellicams.
			Twenty thousand kellicams... now
			within transporter range.
			SuH... (Ready.. )
			They're dropping shields!
			BaH! (Fire!)
			Engaging computer control...
			firing on second target!
			They were able to raise shields
			in time... minor damage only.
			Disruptors off-line!
			All power to shields.
			Shields failing!
			Incoming message.
			On viewer.
			This is Captain Kurn of the
			Hegh'ta. We come to defend the
			Empire... and to follow the banner
			of Gowron.
			The enemy has sustained major
			damage to its life support
			systems... They have disengaged.
			You have done well, Commander
			Kurn. Lursa and B'Etor have
			moved more quickly than I
			anticipated. We shall not
			underestimate them again.
			Meet us at the Great Hall.
			Advise the Enterprise that their
			delegation is welcome to attend...
			my installation as leader.
			Gowron, son of M'Rel, hakt'em.
			The arbiter confirms that you
			have completed the rite of
			succession. Your enemies have
			been destroyed. You stand alone.
			Do you wish to claim leadership
			of the Council?
			I wish it.
			Are there no other challengers?
			Receive now the loyalty of the
			Council and of the Empire.
			Let all who have opposed me now
			swear loyalty or die with shame!
			Qapla!
			naDev ghoS! (Come here!)
			You both fought as warriors...
			you have proved your hearts are
			Klingon.
			I return your family honor... I
			give you back what was wrongfully
			taken from you. Let your name
			be spoken once again. You are
			Worf... son of Mogh.
			The Duras family is gathering a
			large force near Beta Thoridar.
			As per the terms of the Treaty
			of Alliance, I now formally
			request your assistance in
			fighting these enemies of the
			Empire.
			These... enemies are Klingons.
			By right and tradition, I am now
			the sole leader... all who oppose
			me... are traitors.
			I understand your position.
			However, you must be aware that
			the Federation will not become
			involved in what is, by
			definition, an internal Klingon
			matter.
			You arbitrated the rite of
			succession, you are already
			involved!
			And my duties in that regard are
			finished.
			Captain... we must intervene.
			The Duras family is corrupt and
			hungry for power... with no sense
			of honor or loyalty. They
			represent a grave threat to the
			security of the Federation.
			Captain, you and I know that they
			have conspired with Romulans in
			the past. If they should be the
			victors in this war, they will
			surely form a new Klingon/Romulan
			alliance. That would represent
			a fundamental shift of power in
			this quadrant.
			Starfleet must support Gowron...
			it is in the interests of both
			the Federation and the Empire.
			I beg you to support us in our
			cause.
			Mister Worf... non-interference
			in the internal affairs of other
			cultures is one of the guiding
			principles of the Federation...
			and as Starfleet officers, we have
			all sworn an oath to uphold that
			principle regardless of personal
			feeling.
			I am sorry... but I must refuse
			your request.
			Lieutenant...
			I'm afraid that I must now recall
			you to duty. The Enterprise will
			be leaving this sector
			immediately.
			Captain... I respectfully request
			that I be allowed to take an
			extended leave of absence.
			Lieutenant, your responsibilities
			as a Starfleet officer are
			incompatible with remaining aboard
			a Klingon ship during a time of
			war.
			Captain...
			You are ordered to return to duty
			immediately.
			Then... I must resign my
			commission as a Starfleet officer.
			I will await you aboard the
			Bortas.
			Enter.
			Am I intruding?
			No, sir.
			I understand... that you'll be
			serving aboard the Bortas.
			As weapons officer.
			Your tactical knowledge and
			experience should serve them well.
			Thank you, sir.
			Are you certain you've made the
			right decision, Worf?
			Yes.
			I was rescued from Khitomer by
			humans... raised and... loved by
			human parents. I have lived among
			humans for most of my life...
			fought at their sides.
			But I was born Klingon. My heart
			is of that world. I do hear the
			cry of the warrior...
			I belong with my people.
			Being the only Klingon ever to
			serve in Starfleet... gave you
			a singular distinction.
			But I always felt that the most
			unique thing about you was
			your... humanity.
			Compassion... generosity...
			fairness... You took some of the
			best qualities of humanity and
			made them part of you. The
			result... was a man I was proud
			to call one of my officers.
			I'll have your belongings
			transported to the Bortas.
			Thank you...
			Attention on deck!
			Permission to leave the ship, sir?
			Permission granted.
			Qapla'
			Good-bye.
			Dismissed.
			Picard has rejected Gowron's plea
			for help.
			The Enterprise has left orbit.
			Coward! He didn't have the
			courage to face us. The
			Federation is---
			Celebrate later, Toral.
			We should not discount Jean-Luc
			Picard yet. He is human...
			... and humans have a way of
			showing up when you least expect
			them.
