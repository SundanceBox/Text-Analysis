			Doctor Beverly Crusher, Personal
			Log, Stardate 44821.3. Began
			an analysis today of the
			respiratory problems being
			experienced by the populations on
			the two moons of Peliar Zel.
			Finally got an actual letter from
			Wesley... topped the class in
			exo-biology, but he's still
			struggling in Ancient
			Philosophies.
			And... there's... a new man in
			my life.
			Ambassador Odan... Doctor
			Crusher... I was just on my way
			to see you.
			Hello, Data...
			I have completed my study of the
			atmospheric variations which have
			occurred on the moons since the
			new technology was implemented.
			Thank you, Commander. That will
			be most helpful in my efforts to
			mediate the quarrel.
			I could go over them with you now.
			It would not require more than
			two hours.
			We do appreciate it, Data... but
			the Ambassador and I have set
			aside this time... to analyze
			the incidence of lung disease
			among the moons' inhabitants.
			Then it is perfect timing, Doctor
			-- what better occasion to
			integrate my results into your
			study?
			Now that I think about it,
			Commander... you're absolutely
			right. Unfortunately, I'm not
			feeling well... perhaps Doctor
			Crusher could get you started,
			inputting your information... but
			I must I return to my quarters.
			Ambassador, are you still having
			those awful headaches?
			I'll bring you a hypospray to take
			care of it...
			I would be most grateful...
			Put a cold cloth on your forehead
			and lie down, Ambassador. I'll
			be with you shortly.
			I'll set you up at the medical
			monitor, Data... it'll take you
			a while to input the figures,
			won't it?
			At least an hour... but I do not
			believe much time can be saved
			from that estimate by exhibiting
			such haste now...
			Data... there are times... when
			every second does count.
			Somehow, I had an unnatural fear
			that Data was going to barge in
			and ask to discuss the peripheral
			effects of magnetospheric energy
			taps.
			If I don't get back and look at
			his projections, he might come
			looking for me.
			When I first met the formidable
			Doctor Beverly... I thought to
			myself... "This woman is ice...
			through to her bones... "
			Who would have dreamed... that
			instead of ice, there is fire...
			I can't believe this has
			happened... in just a week...
			Stay here... don't go...
			Odan... are we... is this...
			interfering? With your work on
			the Peliar Zel problems?
			Fortunately I've done about as
			much as I can until we get there.
			Because I wouldn't be able to
			keep my mind on work now...
			Odan... I have to get back...
			Promise me we'll be together
			tonight...
			I promise...
			Then go, Doctor Beverly...
			It's just Beverly...
			Not just Beverly. It's Beverly's
			smile and her kindness, her
			beauty, within and without. So
			much more than just Beverly...
			Picard to Ambassador Odan...
			Yes, Captain? This is Odan...
			The Federation representative from
			Peliar Zel has come on board.
			Could you meet us in the
			Observation Lounge?
			I'll be right there, Captain.
			And Ambassador... if you should
			run into Doctor Crusher, would
			you ask her to join us as well?
			By all means. If I run into her.
			Where've you been?
			With a patient. Minor emergency.
			Ambassador Odan, this is Governor
			Leka Trion, of Peliar Zel.
			Ambassador... thank you for
			coming.
			I knew your father.
			His efforts helped keep our
			people at peace for several
			generations.
			I would hope to serve you as well
			as he.
			I hope Doctor Crusher was able
			to help you with your headache.
			Thank you. Actually, she was.
			Governor Leka has intercepted us
			before we reached her planet in
			order to update us on the
			situation.
			It has grown progressively worse.
			The people on our moons have been
			in discord ever since they
			migrated from the planet five
			centuries ago. For us on the
			planet... it is like having two
			squabbling children. We try to
			help settle their arguments
			without taking sides... but this
			time, we are at a loss.
			I've been studying the information
			you sent... If I understand
			correctly, the people of Alpha
			moon have found a way to tap
			directly into the magnetic field
			of your planet, and now rely
			exclusively on that energy
			source.
			Yes. But the Beta moon seems to
			be suffering some environmental
			damage as a result.
			My design models suggest that Beta
			will begin to experience rising
			temperatures... erratic tide
			surges... and in general the
			beginnings of global warming.
			The impact on the health of the
			Betan people is clear. There
			will be profound medical
			repercussions.
			Alpha is unwilling to lose their
			new-found energy source... Beta
			accuses them of intentionally
			courting genocide... our efforts
			to find a compromise have failed.
			And now --
			-- we've received intelligence
			that both sides are arming for
			war. If that happens... the
			people of my planet will begin
			to take sides... the outcome can
			only be disastrous.
			We will be in orbit around Peliar
			Zel within six hours. If you can
			arrange for the representatives
			of Alpha and Beta to be there,
			Ambassador Odan can beam directly
			to the planet.
			Excuse me, Captain... I would
			prefer to shuttle to the surface.
			I would not recommend it. There
			are many radical factions involved
			in this dispute. It would be
			difficult to guarantee your
			safety.
			I'm sure I'm not the first who
			has expressed discomfort with the
			idea of molecular transport.
			Thank you, but I much prefer to
			keep myself intact. I'll shuttle
			down.
			As you like.
			Counselor... ?
			It's Ambassador Odan... I continue
			to feel such... fluctuations...
			of emotion from him.
			Maybe it's just spring, Deanna...
			Or perhaps these sensations are
			perfectly normal among the Trill.
			It could be... we know so little
			about them...
			But he seems a lovely person...
			very much a gentleman, don't you
			think?
			Yes. Quite.
			Is that the colgonite astringent
			you have on your eyes? I've never
			tried it...
			Yes... I mean, I guess it is...
			someone just put it on me...
			I never knew you even came in
			here...
			I don't. I mean, not usually...
			But sometimes it feels good just
			to indulge yourself...
			I guess so...
			Especially when you haven't done
			so for a while...
			What's that supposed to mean?
			Beverly... you're in love.
			How... how did you know?
			I don't really think it's much
			of a secret.
			It isn't?
			No. You've been -- glowing.
			"Glowing... " Well, yeah... that's
			just how I feel, Deanna...
			What... ?
			Nothing --
			Yes, there is, I can tell. What
			is it?
			Just... something I sense in Odan.
			What? What do you sense?
			I'm not sure how to describe it...
			and I'm not saying there's
			anything wrong, it's just...
			Beverly... how well do you really
			know him?
			I... I feel like I know him better
			than anyone I've ever known...
			but...
			Am I being foolish? I don't think
			so... and yet... it's only been
			a couple of weeks... Of course,
			maybe that means it's just
			infatuation... but I'm a grown
			up, I know the difference between
			love and infatuation...
			But one thing I'm sure of... is
			that I haven't felt like this in
			a long time...
			And you like it...
			I like it.
			Come.
			You wanted to see me?
			Yes, Ambassador. We've entered
			orbit... the shuttle will
			transport you to the surface in
			a few minutes.
			I am ready, Captain.
			How will you proceed once you're
			there?
			I cannot answer that. I never
			know until I am into the
			situation... meet the people
			involved. I work very much by
			instinct, not by pre-arranged
			plan.
			It seems to work well for you.
			I do like to go into a situation
			as well informed as possible...
			and your staff has been quite
			helpful in briefing me on the
			problems involved here.
			Particularly Doctor Crusher.
			My staff is quite capable. I'm
			glad they've been useful.
			Your Doctor Beverly is an
			extraordinary person... both as
			a scientist... and as a woman.
			I'm sure that's true. Well...
			shall we make our way to the
			Shuttlebay?
			Captain... you know her better
			than I... do you have any idea
			how -- committed -- she is to
			remaining with Starfleet?
			I wouldn't presume to speak for
			her.
			Of course not. I just thought...
			you've known her for so long...
			Ensign Taggert to Captain
			Picard...
			Yes, Ensign?
			The shuttle is ready to transport
			the Ambassador.
			Very well.
			I can find my own way, Captain.
			I hope to bring good news when
			I return.
			Commander Riker asked to pilot
			you himself, Ambassador.
			I am honored.
			I don't know when I'll be back...
			I know... have a safe trip.
			I will stay safe, Doctor
			Beverly... I have good reason
			to return...
			I have researched earth customs.
			This flower is given to express
			love.
			Yes, it is...
			Initiate shuttle pre-flight
			sequence.
			Pre-flight under way...
			counting to clearance...
			Shuttle has cleared the Bay door.
			Commander Riker, you will be out
			of shield range in five seconds.
			Acknowledged, Lieutenant. We'll
			be entering the upper ionosphere
			in two minutes, twenty seconds.
			Captain... an unidentified ship
			is emerging from the limb of the
			moon.
			Hail the vessel.
			I have visual contact. I don't
			recognize it.
			Sir, it claims to be an escort
			vessel from the Beta moon.
			There was no mention of an
			escort... request a security
			clearance code.
			They do not answer, sir.
			Commander, stand by to return to
			the Shuttlebay.
			Captain -- the escort ship is
			loading its phaser banks!
			Increasing power to the shields...
			coming about...
			Engage tractor beam. Number One
			-- report.
			We've lost the port thruster and
			both back-up stabilizers... I'm
			losing control...
			We're bringing you in.
			Captain, the shuttle hull has been
			weakened. We're breaking up...
			you can't tow us. Better beam
			us directly on board...
			No... don't do it...
			I can't stabilize the shuttle...
			If you transport me, it will kill
			me... please...
			Number One... we're ready to beam
			you aboard.
			Belay that, Captain. I'm going
			to bring her in manually.
			Advise Doctor Crusher we have a
			medical emergency.
			He's in shock... he's lost a lot
			of blood... but that doesn't
			account for these readings...
			Eosinophilia in the cerebrospinal
			fluid at forty-six percent.
			Sedimentation rate is
			twenty-nine... but his lymphocytes
			are intact...
			It's as though there's a parasite
			at work...
			Odan... I have to do exploratory
			surgery. You may have a parasitic
			infection...
			You must not.
			But... you won't survive...
			What is that... ?
			Beverly... that... is me...
			What... ?
			This body... is just a host. I
			am that parasite... and that is
			what must survive.
			It has always been this way...
			the Trill are a joined species...
			a host and a symbiont... and in
			this fashion we have survived for
			millenia...
			You're dying... what can I do?
			The host body is dying... You must
			contact the Trill quickly... tell
			them I need another host. They
			will send a replacement.
			I know it is hard to accept...
			but I beg you, Doctor Beverly...
			help me... this mission must be
			completed.
			Odan's host body died of the
			injuries just over an hour ago.
			But the symbiont being...
			Odan... is still alive.
			Odan is the one who negotiated
			the last treaty. The man everyone
			thought was his father was just
			another host body.
			And the reason Odan refused the
			transporter...
			It would have damaged the
			symbiont.
			We have contacted the Trill.
			Another host will arrive within
			forty hours.
			I've placed Odan in stasis.
			He can survive for an hour...
			maybe two... but not beyond that.
			Is it possible I could serve as
			a temporary carrier?
			No, Data. The relationship
			requires a biological being.
			We are at a desperate impasse with
			the situation in the Peliar
			system. The attack on our
			shuttlecraft has inflamed the
			dispute.
			Who was responsible, Captain?
			No one will admit anything. Each
			side accuses the other and threats
			are mounting. We need Odan...
			Doctor... could a human host carry
			him?
			I... believe so. From Odan's
			description of the process... it
			should be possible. But --
			Then I volunteer.
			There's been no precedent for a
			human host. I couldn't guarantee
			what... what might happen.
			Would you be able to remove the
			symbiont when the new host
			arrives?
			In theory, yes. I just don't know
			what might happen to a human body
			in the process.
			Commander... the risk is too
			great.
			Weigh it against the prospect
			of war.
			It is your choice, Will.
			Then let's get to it.
			I've given you a local
			anesthetic... but you must be
			conscious while the implantation
			takes place. Drugs might damage
			the symbiont.
			I understand.
			Laser scalpel.
			How are you feeling? Is there
			pain?
			No... just... strange
			sensations...
			Vital signs?
			Heart rate one hundred ten...
			blood pressure ninety over
			forty...
			I can't close yet... the
			assimilation isn't complete...
			Pulse one thirty... and
			climbing... E.E.G. erratic.
			He's going to start fibrillating.
			Two hundred milligrams
			metrazene...
			Will... hang on...
			I'm closing...
			No change...
			The metrazene should have
			stabilized him... I'll give it
			ten seconds more before we go
			in again.
			Blood pressure leveling off...
			I think he's stabilizing.
			That's better... signs are
			returning to normal.
			Will... it's Beverly. Can you
			hear me?
			Hello...
			You're going to be all right.
			How do you feel?
			I am just fine... but you look
			tired, Doctor Beverly.
			I realize it will be disturbing,
			Governor... but you must convince
			the inhabitants of the moons that
			I am Odan... I have his thoughts,
			his memories, his skills...
			They will perceive you as a
			Starfleet officer... perhaps with
			your own agenda...
			The man they knew as my father...
			the man who stands before them
			now... both are merely hosts.
			It is your task to help them
			understand.
			I will try. I cannot promise they
			will listen. They are more
			factionalized than ever, and
			listening is a skill which seems
			to have evaporated in the heat
			of argument.
			Speak softly, Governor. People
			who cannot hear an angry shout...
			will often strain to hear a
			whisper.
			I will do what I can.
			Well done.
			Sorry... a little dizzy...
			Mister Worf, take the Ambassador
			to his quarters.
			I'll be all right... just need
			to lie down a minute...
			Bridge to Crusher...
			Yes, Captain?
			The Ambassador is not well.
			Please see to him in his quarters.
			Right away, sir.
			I'm getting a slightly elevated
			white cell count... six-tenths
			of a degree of temperature...
			... nothing that indicates
			rejection.
			That's good...
			But you look awfully pale...
			Just a little weak...
			light-headed...
			Cerebral blood flow looks
			normal...
			I'll leave you a metabolic
			booster... use it if the symptoms
			get worse...
			Beverly...
			Beyond that, I don't know what
			to do.
			This is... all new for me.
			For me as well.
			Please don't go... we need to talk
			about this...
			I... don't know what to say...
			where to begin...
			Nor do I... but I know that
			silence will injure us...
			Maybe you should have thought
			about that sooner. Maybe you
			should have told me what you were.
			It didn't bother you to stay
			silent yesterday...
			But... it never occurred to me.
			This is what I am... did you tell
			me you are only a single being?
			Of course not... it is normal
			for you...
			I don't know how to handle this...
			I just... don't know who you
			are...
			I understand... but whoever I seem
			to be... I am Odan... the man who
			loved you... and that has not
			changed. I still love you. I
			can't help that.
			But if that causes you pain...
			I will suppress it. I will keep
			my distance, Doctor Beverly. I
			would never hurt you.
			Five card draw. Ante up.
			Commander -- come on in...
			Geordi... I believe the correct
			term now would be "Ambassador."
			You can call me anything you like.
			I know this must be difficult for
			you.
			May I join you?
			Sure! Sit down... right here...
			We are pleased you're here.
			Are you familiar with this game,
			Ambassador?
			No.
			But... I seem to have done this
			before...
			Ambassador, what is the precise
			nature of the symbiotic joining?
			Are you Odan? Or Commander Riker?
			Or a combination of both?
			I wish I could give you an answer
			as simple as the question.
			Ordinarily, the host body has no
			personality. This time... is
			different somehow.
			I've never done this... and yet
			I know how.
			And something compelled me to come
			here tonight... though I didn't
			consciously know what would await
			me. It is as though... Will Riker
			is here with me... I have never
			felt that with other hosts.
			I guess the question is... will
			the Commander be alright... when
			he comes back?
			Gentlemen... I am making you
			uncomfortable. Please... continue
			without me.
			May I join you?
			The first man I ever loved
			unconditionally... was named
			Stefan.
			He was a soccer player... I would
			watch him race down the field and
			I thought my heart would stop
			because he was so beautiful...
			We married and had three
			children... twin boys, Andrew and
			Alex, and then a girl, Jennifer...
			Stefan became a famous artist and
			created huge, breathtaking metal
			sculptures... I kept house and
			made the world easy for him...
			and he came to adore me as much
			as I worshipped him...
			At least in my daydreams. Stefan
			was eleven... and I was eight.
			He never even knew I existed.
			Deanna... I loved Odan. I'm sure
			of that... I had no doubts, no
			fears...
			... and now... I don't know what
			it was I loved. His eyes... his
			hands, his mouth... his body?
			They're gone. If that was all
			it was, I should mourn him and
			go on...
			But there was so much more... I
			felt completely free with him...
			unguarded... at ease with
			myself... There were so many
			things that made him special to
			me. Where are they? Are they
			still here... alive in Will Riker?
			I look at Will and I see someone
			I've known for years... a kind of
			brother. But... inside... is it
			really Odan... ?
			Help me, Deanna... please...
			What... what do your feelings tell
			you?
			I feel the pull... it's
			powerful...
			I wish he'd never come on this
			ship... I was happy tending
			patients and doing my research...
			Don't wish that, Beverly... you
			can never be open to love if you
			won't risk pain...
			I don't care... I'd give anything
			not to feel the way I do now...
			there's no happiness that's worth
			this...
			He's here. He just walked in.
			Look at him.
			I don't want to look at him...
			Talk to me Deanna, please... keep
			talking.
			The first man I ever loved... was
			my father. He was strong and
			tall... he carried me when the
			ground was muddy... he chased away
			the monsters who hid under my bed
			at night... he sang to me and he
			kept me safe. And then he went
			away.
			What I wouldn't give to hear his
			songs again... to feel his arms
			protect me. I never will. But
			I can still feel his warmth, his
			love... as though he were here
			with me.
			Beverly, if you can feel those
			things from the man we know as
			Will Riker, accept them, accept
			the love.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 44823.8.
			Representative of the moons of
			Peliar Zel have agreed to come
			on board to meet the new
			Ambassador Odan.
			White count is elevated... it's
			higher every time I read it...
			Are you in pain?
			Not much...
			Ambassador... I can stall the
			representatives...
			No. They would consider it
			deception. I must meet them.
			Surely... to present yourself in
			this condition... will not help
			our cause.
			I promise you, Captain... they
			will not know I am ill.
			Captain... the emissaries.
			May I present Kalin Trose, of
			Alpha moon... and Lathal Bine,
			of Beta moon.
			Thank you for receiving us,
			Captain.
			Is this Ambassador Odan?
			Lathal Bine... It was your aunt
			who represented Beta thirty years
			ago...
			That is correct.
			A formidable woman. I had the
			utmost respect for her.
			And who was it who spoke for
			Alpha... so long ago... ?
			It was you, of course, Kalin
			Trose. Then you were a young man,
			bristling with passion and zeal...
			But wise enough to see that your
			people needed peace to ensure
			their future...
			And... how did you manage to
			achieve a compromise... between
			that young man and the iron-willed
			woman of Beta moon?
			They agreed to trade places for
			a week... understand each other's
			situation with more informed
			eyes... after that -- an agreement
			came swiftly.
			Nothing you have said is beyond
			what a school child could learn
			from a history book.
			But it's not commonly known...
			that during those negotiations...
			Kalin Trose, you quelled a plot
			by radicals on your moon to
			assasinate the Beta delegation.
			It... is true.
			Perhaps he was wiser in his youth
			than he is now. Odan -- you must
			convince him to stop --
			Do you accept me? Will you allow
			me to work with you?
			Yes. The people of Beta moon
			accept you.
			And Alpha moon?
			I will consider it. But I must
			consult others.
			This is a typical tactic... he
			is an obstructionist, you can see
			that --
			Kalin Trose, you may confer with
			your people. But we must have
			your answer within eight hours.
			You shall have it.
			Beverly... help me...
			All his vital functions are
			overworked. His immune system
			is under attack. I can only guess
			that he's going through classic
			rejection syndrome.
			Is there any treatment you can
			give him?
			I can administer an
			immunosuppressant. It would help
			with the symptoms... but it
			wouldn't correct the underlying
			cause. He's carrying a foreign
			organism in his body.
			I don't know what to do... medical
			school didn't exactly prepare me
			for a situation like this...
			You're doing all you can...
			Thank you. I wish that were more
			comforting.
			Don't worry about me, Captain.
			I'm fine.
			Ambassador... when you feel up
			to it, please join me in my Ready
			Room.
			I'm giving you something that
			should help you feel better. At
			least temporarily.
			The pain is gone... thank you...
			Please... don't...
			Let me touch you... just for a
			moment...
			No... please...
			It was a fast decision, which we
			must take as positive. The Alphan
			representative has agreed...
			somewhat dubiously... to let you
			mediate the dispute.
			I was sure they would. They are
			reasonable people... just trapped
			in their own anger.
			I have no doubt, however, that
			they will bolt if anything goes
			wrong in your discussions.
			Then it's up to me to make sure
			nothing goes wrong.
			Have I said something wrong... ?
			No... it's just... for a
			moment... you sounded more like
			Will Riker.
			We have received word that your
			new host will arrive in eighteen
			hours. Will you be all right
			until then?
			The medication which Doctor
			Beverly gave me has helped. I
			will find a way to keep going.
			It is an awkward situation for
			her. As you can imagine.
			Yes. Yes, I certainly can.
			And for you as well.
			My life has been spent... trying
			to help others find solutions to
			insoluble problems. And now...
			I am confronted with one of my
			own for which there is truly no
			answer.
			Lemon tea...
			Computer... location of Doctor
			Beverly Crusher.
			Doctor Crusher is in her
			quarters.
			Can you make balso tonic?
			There is no formula on record.
			Please supply a molecular
			structure.
			Never mind.
			Come in...
			I thought... I should see how
			you're doing. If you needed
			another hypospray...
			I don't think so... the symptoms
			have not returned...
			Ah. Well... that's good.
			Yes.
			Tomorrow is an important day.
			Do you feel -- ready for it?
			I think so. I have been
			preparing.
			That's good.
			Yes.
			I'll check your vital signs in
			the morning... before the
			representatives get here.
			They must not know I'm taking
			medication...
			You could arrange to take a series
			of breaks...
			That's good...
			Yes...
			Beverly... I want you...
			If you are going to leave... you
			must go now...
			I'm not leaving.
			Captain's log, Stardate 44824.4.
			The representatives of Peliar Zel
			and its two moons are ready to
			transport on board. We have
			learned that they each have
			troops massed and are ready for
			combat if this final effort at
			peace is not successful.
			White count is back up...
			temperature elevated... the
			effects of the medication are
			wearing off faster every time.
			I'll administer one now... and
			hope it holds for an hour or
			two...
			No... no more.
			Ambassador... it's clear you're
			in pain. You can't get through
			the next hours without help --
			I must.
			Are the injections damaging the
			host body... Riker's body?
			Yes. I cannot put him at further
			risk.
			But how can you function? Conduct
			the meeting?
			I'll manage.
			We will respect your wishes.
			Further... I will conduct the
			mediation today... but at the end
			of today, regardless of the
			outcome... I must be removed from
			Riker's body. Even if the new
			host has not yet arrived.
			But... you wouldn't survive...
			Riker will not survive unless I
			am removed. He has given
			enough...
			Odan...
			Your word.
			Very well.
			Worf to Captain Picard...
			Yes, Mister Worf?
			The representatives have arrived.
			I will escort them to the
			Observation Lounge.
			Thank you.
			I'll stand by with the medication,
			just in case. The pain may become
			so intense --
			Beverly...
			Whatever else I have been to
			you... I am your friend. I cannot
			imagine what you are going
			through... but it must be a kind
			of hell. I want you to know...
			I am here... to help you... in
			any way I can.
			Jean-Luc...
			Computer, what time is it?
			Fifteen thirty five hours.
			They've been in there almost six
			hours...
			Captain... a message from the ship
			carrying the Trill host...
			Are they here?
			No. They are experiencing
			difficulty. They do not
			anticipate their arrival for
			another nine hours.
			Nine hours...
			Ambassador...
			It was worth it...
			They will not go to war...
			Mister Worf, make sure the
			representatives are safely
			transported off the ship.
			Ensign, set a course to intercept
			the Trill ship. Prepare to go
			to warp nine.
			Sir, it could take more than two
			hours to reach the vessel.
			I have no choice... I gave my
			word. I have to remove him.
			Let's hope we reach the new host
			in time.
			Will is all right. His vital
			signs have stabilized... he's
			sleeping now.
			And... how is Odan?
			I have placed him in stasis. He's
			fine for the moment.
			You need some rest, Doctor.
			No. If Odan is to survive, he
			must be implanted in the host as
			soon as he arrives. I'll wait
			here.
			It will be some time yet.
			I know.
			Doctor...
			Is the Trill host here?
			Yes.
			Thank goodness... bring him in.
			Doctor...
			I am Kareel. I am to become host
			to Odan.
			... the operation to implant Odan
			into the new host was completed
			at nineteen hundred hours and
			appears to have been successful.
			There have been no difficulties
			with assimilation...
			Doctor Beverly...
			Could we talk for a moment?
			You should be sleeping. You need
			rest.
			I've never felt better.
			Except once or twice...
			My poor Beverly... this has been
			so hard for you...
			I want to thank you... for your
			caring... for standing by me...
			I congratulate you. You averted
			a war that would have cost many
			lives...
			Yes. It seems... everything has
			turned out for the best.
			And yes... I am still Odan... and
			I still love you. I cannot
			imagine that ever changing.
			I'm glad you're all right.
			Is there to be nothing more?
			Perhaps it is a human failing...
			but we are not accustomed to
			these kinds of changes. I
			can't... keep up. How long will
			you have this host? What
			would the next one be? I
			couldn't live with that kind of
			uncertainty...
			Perhaps... someday... our ability
			to love will not be so limited.
			I understand.
			Odan...
			I do love you... please remember
			that.
			I will never forget you.
