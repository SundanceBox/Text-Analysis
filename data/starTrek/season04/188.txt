			Captain's Log, Stardate 44502.7.
			Early completion of our mission
			at Harrakis Five has allowed me
			to grant extra personal time for
			many of the crew.
			Given our recent tight scheduling,
			this has come as something of a
			relief.
			Our diplomatic assignment in the
			Evadne system is a ten day journey
			past the Ngame Nebula, and I
			expect it to be uneventful. I
			personally am using the time to
			fulfill a promise to a colleague.
			Dixon Hill around?
			He's occupied at the present
			moment.
			Tell him Gloria is here.
			Can't do that.
			He doesn't want to be disturbed.
			I'm here from...
			Cleveland.
			Doesn't matter if you're from the
			moon, Hon. Mister Hill is
			incommuni... incommunica...
			Incommunicado.
			That's it. Sorry, Hon.
			Listen, Hon. Just tell him
			Gloria's here.
			When the boss doesn't want to be
			disturbed, the boss doesn't want
			to be disturbed. Don't take it
			personal like.
			Mister Hill is expecting me. I
			have a two o'clock appointment.
			It's two-ten.
			Sorry. I had a hard time with
			the outfit...
			It took me awhile to figure out
			what this thing was supposed to
			do...
			Sorry, Dix. There's a... "lady"
			here to see you, says her name
			is...
			Gloria...
			Gloria...
			From Cleveland.
			From Cleveland.
			Okay.
			He never heard of you.
			Never heard of me?
			That's right.
			No, you don't understand... it's
			all been set up in advance... I'm
			supposed to be Gloria from
			Cleveland and I was supposed to
			be in Holodeck Four at two o'clock
			and you don't have the slightest
			idea of what I'm talking about,
			do you?
			Hey, you can't go in there...
			Get inside.
			Who's the doll?
			She's my cousin.
			Gloria. From Cleveland.
			Sorry, Gloria -- I didn't want
			to get you involved. She has
			nothing to do with this, Johnny.
			Yeah, right. What do I look like?
			A jamoke? You ain't nobody's
			cousin and you ain't here for a
			visit. What do you know about
			my money?
			Your money?
			The money he stole.
			You stole his money?
			He's lying, Gloria -- don't
			listen to him.
			Johnny, why don't you tell me all
			about it, maybe I can help, I'm
			a good listener...
			I'm finished with talking,
			sweetheart. Now, I'm gonna get
			some action or else...
			This is what you do for fun?
			It's a mystery, Guinan... Who
			was this man? Who killed him?
			Where's the money he was talking
			about? A mystery. Now, we
			begin the search for clues.
			And that's fun...
			That's fun.
			A forty-eight Packard with
			whitewalls... I couldn't catch
			the license plate...
			Dixon Hill, Private
			Investigations.
			Sorry, there's no Captain Picard
			here. Try down at the docks.
			It's all right. I'll take it,
			Madeline.
			What is it?
			Please excuse the unusual
			interruption, Captain. I thought
			that patching communications
			through the holodeck program would
			be less obtrusive.
			I appreciate the consideration,
			Commander. What can I do for
			you?
			Long range sensors have detected
			a T-tauri type star within a
			pocket of the Ngame cloud.
			Nothing unusual about that.
			No, Sir. However, the star's
			single planet falls within the
			M-Class range. It is capable of
			supporting life.
			Now that is unusual.
			Highly, Sir.
			Yes, thank you, Data. Procedures
			require us to investigate. Recall
			the bridge crew and set a course.
			I'm afraid I have a twenty-fourth
			century mystery to deal with,
			Gloria. You're welcome to carry
			on if you'd like.
			No, I've had enough "fun" for
			one day.
			Entering the T-tauri system, now,
			Captain.
			Sensors indicate an energy
			fluctuation directly in our path.
			Source unknown.
			Still picking up energy
			distortions -- but fading. It
			seems to be gone.
			A wormhole?
			Very likely. Small and extremely
			unstable wormholes have been
			mapped near thirty-nine T-tauri
			systems in the last one hundred
			years alone.
			Captain, I suggest we move to
			a safer location. It could
			reappear at any moment.
			Agreed. Ensign, take us --
			-- Captain!
			Captain?
			Data?
			Careful, Captain. The stun-effect
			from the wormhole was relatively
			severe.
			Apparently so. How long were we
			unconscious?
			Approximately thirty seconds.
			I have scanned the ship and
			detected no life-threatening
			injuries to the crew.
			You were not affected?
			No. My positronic system is
			immune to the effect. This is
			the third unstable wormhole I have
			passed through during my time in
			Starfleet. The first, on-board
			the U.S.S. Trieste --
			-- Thank you, Data.
			Well, where the hell are we?
			Point five-four parsecs from our
			previous position. Almost a day's
			travel... in just thirty seconds.
			Sir, I should re-align the ship's
			clock with Starbase Four-ten's
			subspace signal to adjust for the
			time distortion.
			Proceed.
			Captain, Sickbay here.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			I'm getting scattered reports of
			minor injuries. What happened?
			The Enterprise just jumped through
			a wormhole.
			We were all unconscious for
			about thirty seconds.
			Everybody okay up there?
			Little or no damage on the Bridge,
			Doctor.
			Acknowledged. Crusher out.
			Ship's status?
			Reports coming in now. Nothing
			serious so far.
			Impulse engines and warp drive
			are unaffected, Captain.
			Shields and weapons systems are
			fully functional.
			Counselor? Are you alright?
			Yes... I think so... Excuse me,
			Captain, but I feel a bit...
			unfocused...
			It will pass.
			Not too bad, all things
			considered.
			We're lucky we didn't end up
			half-way across the galaxy and
			in the middle of next week.
			I do not believe that was ever
			a possibility. The wormhole's
			small size and extremely short
			period indicate a relatively local
			phenomenon.
			I didn't mean that literally,
			Data.
			There's still the anomalous
			M-Class planet we were going to
			investigate. Do we go back?
			The unpredictability of the
			wormhole would make our
			investigation a hazardous one.
			A probe from our current position
			would be more advisable.
			Make it so.
			Nothing broken, Chief. But the
			ligaments around the elbow have
			been twisted pretty severely.
			What in the world were you doing
			when you fell?
			Hanging a plant for Keiko. Part
			of her running project to give
			me a green thumb.
			How's it working?
			Everything I touch seems to turn
			brown and wither away.
			Alyssa, would you get me the --
			-- Never mind. I'll do it.
			You, don't go away. We'll fix
			that right up.
			This is impossible.
			Straighten your arm.
			Alyssa?
			Yes, Doctor?
			Did you see anybody near the lab
			today?
			No, I didn't.
			You didn't happen to adjust the
			environments on the incubation
			containers?
			I would never touch one of your
			experiments unless you asked me
			to, Doctor.
			Of course, I'm sorry, Alyssa.
			Probe approaching the T-tauri
			system, Captain.
			Readings, Data?
			Coming in now, sir. The probe
			has moved within visual range of
			the planet.
			On screen.
			Sensors indicate a hydrogen-helium
			composition.
			With a frozen helium core.
			Wait a minute, didn't your
			readings indicate a Class M planet
			before we went through the
			wormhole, Data?
			It is very possible that
			interference from the wormhole
			affected the sensors, Commander.
			This is clearly not a Class M
			planet.
			Data, run a full diagnostic to
			make sure the wormhole didn't
			cause any permanent damage to the
			sensors.
			Aye, Captain.
			Ensign, set us back on a course
			for...
			Number One? A problem?
			It's awfully strange that a
			malfunctioning sensor should give
			such a specific misreading of
			a planet. I would have thought
			that a space/time disturbance
			would cause a lot more confusion
			than that.
			It is conceivable that the
			sensors picked up the afterimage
			of an actual planet that lies on
			the other side of the wormhole.
			We could survey the nearby stars
			for such a planet. It would
			require approximately six weeks.
			We don't have the time.
			We've encountered a minor
			mystery, one that has been solved
			to my satisfaction. Number One,
			unless there's a major objection,
			Ensign McKnight will set us a
			course for Evadne Four.
			No objection.
			Ensign.
			You wanted to see me, Beverly.
			I have something of a minor
			mystery on my hands.
			A "minor mystery"? That seems
			to be a recurring phrase around
			here lately.
			Please.
			Diomedian scarlet moss. I didn't
			know you were an enthno-botanist.
			It's a hobby.
			You've got a good crop going
			there. As I recall, it's not easy
			to cultivate.
			That's just it -- I started the
			spores right before we were all
			knocked unconscious by the
			wormhole. You said we were out
			for thirty seconds?
			Correct.
			Then how come this shows a full
			day's growth?
			Perhaps you've got some sort of
			fast-growth strain.
			Each of these incubators were set
			with spores from completely
			different sources in the Diomedian
			system. I've got a dozen more
			back at the lab. Perhaps
			something extraordinary could have
			happened to one of them, but not
			to all of them.
			But that would mean we were
			unconscious for a full day. And
			yet everything else on board
			indicates that we were out for
			only thirty seconds. The ship's
			chronometer, the computer...
			Everything else... including
			Commander Data.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Commander Data continues to
			maintain that we were unconscious
			for only thirty seconds, despite
			Doctor Crusher's evidence to the
			contrary.
			Captain, I have a hypothesis.
			The twenty-second century
			physicist Pell Underhill
			conjectured that a major
			disruption in time-continuity
			could be compensated for by
			trillions of counter reactions.
			The effect could have allowed
			Doctor Crusher's mosses to arrive
			at the other side of the worm hole
			with the unanticipated growth.
			Underhill was talking about
			energy!
			True. Nevertheless, it is
			possible that the phenomenon could
			occur in matter at much higher
			levels of organization. Given the
			proper conditions.
			Thank you, Data. An intriguing
			hypothesis.
			Perhaps we've got a tempest in
			a test tube, after all.
			Captain --
			Data, I promised Mister Nelson
			in Engineering that you would
			assist him on the sensor
			diagnostics. You'll find him hard
			at work on Deck Thirty-six.
			As you wish, Captain.
			Did you believe Data's
			explanation?
			A frank answer, Commander.
			Not for a second. I'm honestly
			amazed that he even proposed it.
			What are you suggesting, Captain?
			I'm not sure. I have never known
			Data to lie, and yet...
			If we never went through a
			wormhole... then what happened
			to us during that missing day...
			If we were out for a whole day,
			why didn't our beards grow?
			Whatever it was... it seems to
			be something Data doesn't want
			to tell us about...
			It could be that whatever caused
			this situation affected Data as
			well.
			Or it could be that he's telling
			the truth... and this is just...
			another minor mystery.
			I can check the computer's
			chronometer... see if there's
			evidence of tampering...
			A transporter trace analysis might
			give us another indication of
			how much time has actually passed.
			Proceed on both counts.
			Meanwhile, we'll maintain our
			present course. If there is
			something wrong with Data, we
			don't want him aware of our
			suspicions.
			Gentlemen, how goes the battle?
			The long-range, infra-red sensors
			suffered no apparent damage as
			a result of the wormhole. We
			are presently checking the
			neutrino and heavy particle
			detectors.
			Great. I'll take over, Data.
			The Captain wants you back on the
			Bridge.
			See you later in Ten Forward.
			Yes. I will see you then.
			Nelson, I need your help with the
			computer.
			Hello, Chief. How's the elbow?
			Much better. This isn't a house
			call, is it?
			No, it's not. Tell me, who was
			the last one to use the
			transporter before we went through
			the wormhole?
			Ensign Locklin. She's one of my
			technicians.
			Have her report immediately to
			Sickbay.
			Electrolyte concentration.
			Twelve point five deviation from
			previous.
			Interesting...
			Let's check the cellular membrane.
			I'm willing to bet the internal
			turgor pressure is off by almost
			the same amount.
			Eleven three deviation from the
			norm.
			That's what I wanted to hear.
			Thank you, Ensign Locklin.
			That'll be all.
			Crusher to Captain Picard.
			What is it, Doctor?
			I need to see you immediately.
			I'm on my way to Engineering.
			Join me.
			Physiologically, each of us is
			on a daily cycle. Our cells have
			developed rhythms based on a
			twenty-four hour period.
			Our internal clocks.
			Exactly, and I can measure that
			effect at the molecular level.
			I took a trace from the last
			person to use the transporter,
			and compared her cell function
			levels to what they are right now.
			If we were unconscious for only
			thirty seconds, those cycles would
			be nearly synchronous.
			And were they?
			No. We were out for longer than
			thirty seconds, Captain. A lot
			longer.
			I've got some good news, and some
			bad news...
			The good news is that we were
			right about the computer's
			chronometer. There's a security
			program to prevent tampering.
			But it looks now like it was
			disabled, and a new program put
			in its place. Someone reset the
			clock.
			And the bad news?
			Data and I are the only ones
			onboard this ship capable of
			doing it.
			A bit of a mystery, Captain.
			That's an understatement.
			Is it possible that something or
			someone affected you -- without
			your knowledge?
			I am unable to answer that
			question, Captain.
			Data, would you consent to being
			examined by Commander La Forge?
			As you wish, Captain.
			Come.
			Please escort Commander Data to
			Engineering.
			I know the way, Sir.
			Captain's log, supplemental. It
			has become clear that everyone
			aboard the Enterprise has lost
			an entire day. As the mystery
			of what actually occurred during
			those missing hours continues to
			deepen, so do my doubts about
			Commander Data.
			We'll start with the higher
			functions before we get down to
			basics.
			Now, this won't hurt a bit...
			Have you forgotten that my sensory
			inputs are not programmed to
			experience pain, Geordi?
			It's a figure of speech. Bedside
			manner. I was just trying to make
			you comfortable.
			I am perfectly comfortable.
			Pattern recognition, syntactic
			algorithms, heuristic functions
			-- all normal.
			However, I cannot help noticing
			that you appear a bit
			uncomfortable yourself.
			I just don't like having to do
			this, that's all...
			The Captain has expressed doubts
			about my operational capacities.
			Doubts which, given the
			circumstances, seem entirely
			justified. I do not understand
			your reluctance to carry out his
			instructions.
			It's not reluctance exactly...
			more like concern. I don't want
			to find something wrong with you.
			On the other hand...
			Yes?
			It feels like you're not being
			completely... honest with us.
			Data, I'm your freind... if
			something is wrong, tell me...
			maybe I can help you...
			There is nothing I can tell you,
			Geordi, beyond what I have already
			stated.
			Okay.
			Okay...
			I've finished examining Data,
			Captain.
			And?
			Nothing's wrong with the
			technology that I can see. He's
			in perfect condition.
			I was almost hoping you'd find
			a problem.
			He could still be malfunctioning
			beyond my ability to detect it.
			This entire mystery began when
			our sensors detected that planet.
			First it was class "M"... now it
			isn't...
			But the sensors were
			malfunctioning. Our probe clearly
			established the planet could not
			support life...
			Data launched that probe.
			If he rigged the probe, could you
			prove it?
			I could try.
			What happened to us in that
			missing day? Surely clues must
			exist. Each of you think back
			to what you were doing right
			before we blacked out. Reenact
			it if need be. Look for anything
			odd or --
			-- Counselor!
			Deanna, are you alright?
			Just a moment... Yes... I'm
			fine...
			What happened?
			I suddenly became dizzy... I'd
			better go to my quarters.
			Perhaps Sickbay would be a better
			idea.
			No. Really, I'm alright.
			See the counselor to her quarters.
			Aye, Captain.
			Thank you for coming with me,
			Worf.
			Of course. You're certain you
			are well.
			I just need some rest.
			Counselor!
			Security! Override the lock on
			Deanna Troi's quarters! Now!
			What's wrong?
			The mirror... I came in here...
			and I looked into the mirror...
			It wasn't me, Worf... Not me...
			It was my face, but it wasn't me
			inside...
			Is she alright?
			I feel fine...now.
			Signs of stress, adrenaline
			by-products higher than baseline.
			But that's a normal reaction to
			sudden fright. All brain
			functions check out okay.
			Deanna, what happened?
			A hallucination perhaps.
			What did you see?
			It wasn't what I saw. It was what
			I felt. I looked into the mirror,
			and it seemed a stranger was
			staring back at me from behind
			my own eyes.
			As if my own face was a mask.
			La Forge to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Geordi.
			I found something, sir.
			Hello, Worf.
			Doctor.
			Can I help you?
			Perhaps not.
			-- Worf.
			You came in here for something.
			You can trust me.
			A warrior does not complain about
			physical discomfort.
			Are you in pain?
			But the Captain ordered us to
			report anything out of the
			ordinary.
			How did this happen?
			Do you recognize the planet, Data?
			Yes, it is the planet our probe
			detected in the T-tauri system.
			No it's not. Actually, it's
			Tethys Three. I retrieved the
			image from the ship's library.
			The geophysical figures have
			been slightly altered, but it's
			definitely Tethys Three.
			Strange that an obscure planet
			several hundred light years from
			here should be picked up by our
			probe.
			Data, did you take this image
			from the ship's library and then
			program the probe to send it back
			to us?
			I cannot verify that hypothesis.
			But you don't deny it.
			No, Sir.
			Geordi, send another probe to the
			T-tauri system.
			Yes, Sir.
			Sorry, Data.
			Counselor Troi just had a very
			disturbing hallucination.
			Is she alright?
			For the moment. Can you tell me
			if Deanna's incident is in any
			way related to the missing time
			period?
			No, Sir. I cannot.
			Data! You're the key to this
			entire mystery. And you've done
			nothing but block my attempts to
			solve it. Why are you fighting
			me?
			It is not by choice.
			What does that mean?
			I cannot say.
			You would rather endanger Deanna
			Troi, a friend, than tell me
			what's going on?!
			Which would you place first? The
			welfare of a single individual?
			Or that of the entire crew?
			Are you saying that by not
			cooperating, you're actually
			protecting us?
			I am not saying that at all. I
			merely state a possible
			alternative explanation.
			Then I'm going to ask you again.
			And I'm ordering you to respond
			directly. What really happened
			to us?
			I cannot answer that, Captain.
			What would you have me do?! How
			would you handle this, if our
			positions were reversed?
			I am apparently guilty of
			falsifying the Enterprise's
			records. Of interfering with an
			investigation. Of disobeying a
			direct order from my commanding
			officer. Your duty seems clear.
			Do you know what a court-martial
			would mean? Your career in
			Starfleet would be finished.
			I realize that.
			Do you also realize that you would
			most likely be stripped down to
			the wires to find out what the
			hell went wrong?
			Yes, Sir. I do.
			The wrist has been broken.
			Broken, reset, and treated with
			one of our subcutaneous bone
			fusion units.
			During the missing day?
			It's the only possibility.
			You're suggesting he was
			conscious?
			I'm suggesting maybe we all were.
			I certainly didn't repair a broken
			wrist while I was unconscious.
			Our memories of that day?
			Blocked. Possibly erased.
			By whom?
			There are very few individuals
			on board who could have broken
			my wrist.
			Commander Data is one of those
			individuals.
			I can't accept that explanation.
			He does possess the speed and
			strength.
			Granted. But I am beginning to
			suspect that Data is refusing to
			cooperate because he believes he
			is acting in the best interests
			of the Enterprise.
			La Forge to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Geordi.
			Our probe's approaching the
			planet, sir.
			Acknowledged.
			Now maybe we'll get some answers.
			Visuals available now, Captain.
			M-Class. Nickel-iron core,
			nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.
			The same planet our sensors picked
			up before the so-called
			wormhole...
			Affirmative.
			No indication of any space-time
			distortion whatsoever. The probe
			should at least be detecting a
			residual effect, even if the
			wormhole is inactive.
			That's because there isn't a
			wormhole. There never was.
			Sir?
			It was a ruse to throw us off the
			track. Look at the clues. Doctor
			Crusher's incubation experiment,
			the computer clock, the
			transporter trace all indicate
			the existence of a missing day.
			Worf's broken wrist suggests that
			we may have been awake and aware
			for that day, and possibly in a
			struggle for our lives.
			The fact that we're alive suggests
			we must have won.
			Not necessarily, Doctor. Data's
			behavior clearly suggests we did
			not. Why else would he be willing
			to sacrifice his career rather
			than tell us the truth?
			But if we didn't win and we
			didn't lose... ?
			The only alternative left is a
			stalemate. A compromise might
			have been reached... a compromise
			that could have forced Data
			into silence.
			But maybe by uncovering all this,
			we're in danger of upsetting the
			stalemate. Maybe it's best to
			leave well enough alone.
			Possibly, Number One. And I would
			be willing to live with the
			mystery... but Data's role in
			this must be ascertained... or
			he will never be trusted with
			starship duty again. I cannot
			live with that.
			Ensign, take us back to the scene
			of the crime. Go to warp two.
			Within sensor range, Captain.
			Drop to impulse. Lieutenant Worf,
			maximum shields, ready all
			weapons.
			Shields up. Photon torpedos
			armed, phasers standing by.
			Captain, an energy field has
			appeared between our position and
			the planet.
			On screen.
			Hold position. Let's see what
			it does.
			The field has emitted an
			energy-pulse, approaching the
			Enterprise.
			Too slow to be a photon torpedo.
			It might be a probe.
			Let's see what happens when it
			hits the shields.
			Shields undamaged. The
			energy-pulse has dispersed.
			Counselor Troi. What is it?
			The plan has failed.
			You have returned.
			Your ship is again in our space.
			I was unable to prevent this.
			Regardless, you are here.
			Please. The Enterprise is not
			a threat to you. Give me more
			time. Our destruction would only
			--
			Data, the Captain wants me to
			take you to the Bridge.
			Counselor...
			One moment, if you would.
			Please. Do nothing. It may yet
			be possible to salvage the
			situation.
			Reporting as ordered, Captain.
			As you can see, we're back to
			where this all started.
			We must leave immediately.
			Why?
			Any further delay will put all
			of our lives at grave risk.
			Why? What is the source of that
			risk?
			The energy field?
			I cannot say.
			Data, you sound like you're stuck
			in a feedback loop. You have free
			will. You very well can say.
			You have a choice.
			My silence is not by choice, Sir.
			Not by choice?
			Are you somehow being controlled
			by that force? Did Geordi miss
			something when he examined you?
			Geordi's examination was
			exemplary.
			Then why are you still compelled
			to disobey my orders? How --
			During the missing day. Were you
			contacted by Starfleet? Were you
			given orders to conceal the truth
			from us?
			I cannot answer that question.
			We must leave.
			Dammit, Data! It's the only
			explanation that makes sense!
			This ship is not going anywhere
			until I get an answer. Now who
			gave you such an order?
			You did, Sir.
			I... ordered you to lie?
			Captain! The energy field is
			approaching!
			Maintain shields at full intens--
			-- No! You must vary shield
			strength and shape as rapidly as
			possible. Maximum shields will
			only speed the ship's takeover.
			Contact imminent.
			Do as Data says. Now!
			Aye, sir.
			The field is shifting amplitude...
			trying to match the shield...
			Captain, eventually the field will
			be able to penetrate our
			shields... There is no way to
			counter the Paxans' technology.
			We can delay their takeover --
			we cannot prevent it.
			The Paxans. Who are they?
			You have invaded our system.
			You would only harm Counselor
			Troi's body.
			We are explorers, not invaders.
			Your knowledge of us is
			unacceptable.
			They are xenophobes, Sir.
			Isolationists. The Paxans
			terraformed a protoplanet in this
			system to better conceal their
			whereabouts. The apparent
			wormhole we experienced during
			our previous encounter is actually
			a trap designed to keep away
			intruders.
			Go on.
			The energy field stuns everyone
			on board the intruding ship
			putting them in a state of
			biochemical stasis.
			That explains why our beards
			didn't grow.
			Then the Paxans take the ship
			out of their territory.
			The crew wakes up thinking they
			just went through a wormhole,
			so they count their blessings and
			keep going.
			Precisely.
			What went wrong this time?
			My positronic brain is a
			technology unknown to the Paxans.
			Our stun-field had no effect on
			him. He remained conscious as
			we attempted to take over your
			ship.
			When I realized that I alone was
			able to act --
			-- I initiated emergency
			procedures.
			Computer, the crew is
			incapacitated. Engage Emergency
			Plan Zed Zed Alpha.
			Automatic defense procedures
			initiated. Energy field strength
			increasing. Warning, shield
			penetration seventeen percent.
			Computer, begin random fluctuation
			of shield frequency and
			modulation.
			Executed.
			With the Enterprise temporarily
			protected, I revived the crew.
			Computer, release compound A-D-T-H
			into the air flow system; five
			parts per million.
			Acknowledged. Initiating compound
			release now.
			Status, Data?
			The energy field is attempting
			to match shield frequencies, Sir.
			Options, Mister Worf?
			I do not recommend weapons at this
			range.
			Can we go to warp?
			Negative. The field is also
			acting as a tractor beam.
			Warning. Shields have been
			penetrated.
			All systems are frozen, Captain.
			The Paxans can manipulate energy
			structures on many levels. They
			took control of Counselor Troi's
			body to communicate with us.
			Captain!
			No! Everyone stop!
			Who are you?
			You know of our existence. We
			have no choice but to destroy this
			ship.
			If you destroy this ship, others
			will come searching for us. You
			may not be able to stop them all.
			Knowledge of your civilization
			could be spread across half the
			galaxy.
			No...
			Allow us safe passage and we will
			protect your right to privacy to
			the best of our ability. We will
			tell no one of your existence.
			There are over a thousand
			lifeforms on this vessel. How
			could you assure their silence?
			This biochemical stasis. Does
			it supress synaptic functions?
			It does.
			Then you must have the capability
			of affecting memory. Could you
			erase the short term memory of
			everyone on this ship? Remove
			all knowledge of this event?
			Allow us to proceed as though it
			never happened?
			It would take time. One of your
			days.
			And he is immune to our influence.
			Data, I have to give you a most
			unusual order... I'm not quite
			sure how well you will be able
			to integrate it into your
			program...
			As a Starfleet officer, I am
			required to follow all of your
			orders, Captain.
			Good. Because our survival
			depends upon it. I am ordering
			you never to reveal what has
			happened here today. Not to
			Starfleet, not even to myself.
			You will conceal your memory of
			the Paxans for as long as you
			live. Is that understood?
			Completely, Captain.
			Satisfactory?
			Agreed.
			Excellent.
			Now, our task is to eliminate any
			information in the ship's records
			that might lead to knowledge of
			this incident. Let's get to work.
			We proceeded to erase all evidence
			of our encounter with the Paxans.
			I reset the computer's chronometer-and
			the crew was again stunned
			into unconsciousness and their
			short term memories erased. When
			they were revived a day later,
			the computer adjustments made it
			appear that only thirty seconds
			had passed.
			And here we are.
			Here we are again.
			Your plan failed. This ship must
			be destroyed.
			Wait. Please.
			The plan failed because clues were
			left behind that suggested a
			mystery. And to many humans, a
			mystery must be solved. Doctor
			Crusher's incubation experiment,
			Worf's wrist, Troi's
			hallucinations... little pieces
			of evidence that led us to even
			more clues about the clock, the
			transporter trace, Data's odd
			behavior... Don't you see...
			without clues, there would be no
			mystery! If we were to simply
			eliminate all the clues and
			begin again...
			Again?
			Exactly. Consider the first time
			a run-through, a rehearsal... to
			shake out all the flaws. The
			second time will succeed -- if
			we leave no clues.
			You are a most unusual species.
			Worthy of a second chance.
			Proceed.
			Deanna?
			Welcome back.
			Data, Geordi -- reconfigure the
			computer and all records. Number
			One, you're to oversee the rest
			of the ship.
			Let's get it right this time.
			Data, what happened... ?
			The effect from the wormhole was
			rather intense.
			I should say so...
			Everyone but myself was rendered
			unconscious. My positronic brain
			is immune to the effect.
			How long were we out?
			Thirty seconds, Sir.
			Current position?
			Point five-four parsecs from our
			previous position; bearing
			two-eight-five mark
			one-four-seven.
			It could be worse.
			Yes, Captain. The wormhole
			appears to have been a local
			phenomenon.
			Crusher to Bridge. What happened?
			The ship just went through a
			wormhole. The entire crew was
			unconscious for approximately
			thirty seconds.
			Anyone hurt on the Bridge?
			Apparently not.
			Acknowledged. Crusher out.
			Status reports?
			No damage to Engineering.
			Shields and weapons systems
			unaffected.
			Counselor?
			There's a general feeling of
			disorientation on board. Nothing
			serious as far as I can tell.
			Well, then. We still have that
			anomalous M-Class planet to
			investigate.
			Ensign, replot a course back to...
			Sir, it is likely that the
			anomalous readings were caused by
			the wormhole's effect. It was
			extremely unstable. I would
			recommend against returning. It
			might put the Enterprise at
			further risk.
			We could sent a probe...
			That would certainly be
			sufficient, Commander.
			Make it so. And put out a hazard
			advisory to Starfleet.
			Aye, sir.
			Set a course to Evadne Four,
			Ensign.
			Course laid in, sir.
			Engage.
