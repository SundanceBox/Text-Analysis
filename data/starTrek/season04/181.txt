			Captain's Log: Stardate 44246.3
			We are investigating radiation
			anomalies reported in the Gamma
			Arigulon system by the starship
			LaSalle. Preliminary readings
			are inconclusive.
			Mister Data?
			No change, Commander. I can
			detect no abnormalities in the
			star's radiant energy.
			Prepare two class one probes.
			Probes ready, sir.
			Initiate launch sequence.
			Captain... Klingon attack cruiser
			decloaking, bearing zero-one-zero
			mark three-two-seven.
			Belay that order, Mister Data.
			Did Starfleet mention any Klingon
			ships in this sector?
			On screen.
			We are being hailed.
			All stop, Mister Crusher.
			Aye, sir. All stop.
			Open channel.
			Hello, Captain Picard.
			Ambassador K'Ehleyr... This is
			an unexpected pleasure.
			It's good to see you again,
			Captain.
			Lieutenant Worf.
			How may we be of assistance,
			Ambassador?
			There is an urgent matter we must
			discuss, Captain. Permission to
			come aboard?
			Granted.
			Lieutenant, please receive our
			guest.
			Captain... I must request
			permission to... send another
			officer.
			May I ask your reason?
			My... dishonor among Klingons...
			may offend Ambassador K'Ehleyr.
			You are a member of this crew,
			Lieutenant... and I will not have
			you go into hiding whenever a
			Klingon ship uncloaks.
			I withdraw the request, sir.
			I just received coordinates, sir.
			Ready to transport two from the
			Klingon vessel.
			Two?
			Yes, sir.
			Energize.
			I hope he'll be all right.
			Alexander hasn't had much contact
			with other children.
			Bridge.
			Not even a bite on the cheek for
			old time's sake?
			Perhaps you are not aware of my
			dishonor. I have accepted...
			discommendation.
			I've heard. So now what? I have
			to perform some ridiculous ritual
			to talk to you?
			You may not respect our
			traditions... I do!
			Sorry. I just thought you might
			want to talk.
			A few minutes ago, you looked like
			someone with a question to ask.
			Must I ask the question?
			Yes. You must.
			What should I tell Alexander...
			that he has no father?
			The Klingon Empire is at a
			critical juncture. We may be
			facing civil war.
			War over what?
			The usual excuses... tradition...
			duty...
			honor...
			The word "excuses" implies that
			there are ulterior motives for
			a conflict.
			I won't bore you with the
			intricacies of Klingon politics.
			Basically, two factions are
			trying to seize power.
			Do you believe there is a threat
			to the Federation in this...
			struggle?
			Klingon wars seldom remain
			confined to the Empire. Sooner
			or later they'll drag in the
			neighboring star systems, then
			the Tholians, the Ferengi... the
			Federation won't be able to stay
			out of it for long.
			This has been coming for some
			time. Only K'mpec, the head of
			the council, has been able to
			maintain the peace.
			Now something has changed that.
			Correct.
			K'mpec is dying.
			He is aboard the cruiser. He has
			come specifically to meet with
			you, Captain. Alone.
			It's about time you arrived,
			Picard. Didn't she tell you I
			was dying?
			I heard you were ill.
			I'm not ill, I'm dying. Sit.
			I need your help.
			If the Enterprise medical
			facility...
			Too late. For months I've been
			poisoned with small doses of
			Veridium Six.
			The wine. There is no cure.
			What do you want of me?
			After I die... you will act in
			my name to arbitrate the struggle
			for power.
			I will?
			No one on the Council can be
			trusted and... I have my reasons
			for wanting an... outsider.
			K'mpec. You can't be serious.
			A Federation officer has no
			business...
			Nonsense. You are an accomplished
			mediator. This is no different
			than any other dispute requiring
			your services.
			On the contrary, I think it is
			very different. And I must
			respectfully decline.
			If you refuse the dying request
			of the Klingon Supreme
			Commander... it will be a
			Federation insult to all Klingons!
			Besides, I've already sent the
			orders to the leaders of the two
			opposing factions. They're on
			their way.
			You had no right to involve me
			without my permission.
			If I'd asked, you would have said
			no.
			This is not a case of simple
			mediation... you are asking me
			to choose the next leader of the
			Klingon Empire.
			No. By tradition, the two
			strongest challengers fight for
			the right of succession. But as
			mediator only you can designate
			those challengers.
			But you've just said there are
			only two challengers arriving.
			What is the point?
			The point, my good Captain Picard,
			is for you to discover which one
			of them has killed me -- Gowron
			or Duras.
			Yes -- Duras. I thought you'd
			find that interesting.
			Interesting? Yes, I would say
			that, since he conspired to strip
			Worf of his good name and tried
			to have me killed...
			And I approved.
			All for the good of the Empire.
			That should be my epitaph.
			Find the assassin. The Klingon
			who kills without showing his face
			has no honor. He must not lead
			the Empire. Such a man would
			be capable of anything. Even war
			with the Federation.
			Very well. I accept.
			If there is war... it will not
			end quickly. Millions of
			warriors... hundreds of worlds...
			destruction on a galactic scale...
			Part of me regrets that I'll miss
			it.
			Captain's log: supplemental.
			K'mpec, who ruled the Klingon
			Empire longer than anyone in
			history, is dead. We await the
			arrival of Duras and Gowron...
			rivals for the leadership of the
			High Council.
			There is no honor in attacking
			the weak.
			I would have won!
			You must earn victory...
			Where are the other Klingons?
			There are no others on board.
			Why?
			The Federation and the Klingon
			Empire were enemies for many
			years. No other Klingons have
			asked to serve in Starfleet.
			Why?
			A warrior does not ask so many
			questions.
			I don't want to be a warrior.
			Hello! You're back early.
			He made me leave.
			Why don't you go to your room and
			play.
			Is he under arrest?
			He knows nothing of our ways!
			Our ways? You mean Klingon ways,
			don't you?
			He is Klingon!
			He is also my son... and I am half-
			human. He will find his own ways.
			Why the sudden concern? You won't
			even acknowledge that he's yours.
			Why did you not tell me?
			And what would you have done?
			That's right... you would have
			insisted that we take the oath...
			just as tradition would demand.
			You should not have kept this from
			me.
			Well, now you know.
			I cannot... acknowledge my
			relationship to the boy.
			It would only harm him.
			Because you were dishonored?
			As my son, he would also bear my
			disgrace... as would his
			children.
			Why did you accept discommendation
			from the High Council?
			My father was accused of
			collaborating with the Romulans
			at Khitomer...
			I know. And I also know that
			you challenged it...
			Yes... at first. Ultimately...
			I withdrew my challenge.
			But why, Worf? I can't believe
			you'd just give up.
			What really happened?
			Lieutenant Worf, Ambassador
			K'Ehleyr, report to the Bridge.
			On our way, Commander.
			Klingon vessels Vorn and Buruk
			holding stations at thirteen
			kilometers.
			Open a channel, Mister Data.
			Channel open. Vorn responding
			to hail.
			On screen.
			Let's get this over with, Picard.
			In good time, Duras.
			Even in death, K'mpec makes
			foolish decisions. You should
			not be involved in this, human.
			The Sonchi ceremony will take
			place in one hour aboard K'mpec's
			ship.
			One hour! What is the delay?
			There is no delay. It is the time
			I have chosen.
			Exactly one hour, Picard. Do not
			be late.
			Keep that pahtk away from the
			ceremony, Picard. He has no place
			on a Klingon ship.
			Picard... out.
			Contact Gowron's ship, tell him
			to meet us aboard K'mpec's vessel.
			Ambassador, I'll meet you in
			Transporter Room Six in an hour.
			We'll begin the ceremony a little
			late.
			Mister Worf.
			Worf, I know the next couple of
			days will be difficult for you...
			You have made it clear that I am
			to perform my regular duties,
			sir.
			I want you to know I am aware
			of your... discomfort.
			Thank you, sir.
			Ambassador K'ehleyr will be
			preparing me for my role in the
			rite of succession. But I have
			no doubt that I will be calling
			upon you for assistance as well,
			Lieutenant.
			Permission to speak freely, sir?
			Granted.
			Duras must not be allowed to lead
			the council.
			He has a legal claim, Worf. Your
			personal feelings toward him...
			It is not personal, sir. His
			father betrayed my people to the
			Romulans. Duras is a traitor.
			Klingon tradition may blame the
			son for the father's sins. I
			cannot, Worf. Treason was his
			father's disgrace. Duras' crime
			was to put that blame on your
			father... I will not forget that.
			But you should not forget that
			you chose to accept the
			consequences of that lie.
			To preserve the Empire.
			The issue now is whether or not
			he killed K'mpec.
			Sir?
			He was murdered... poisoned.
			A Klingon would not use poison...
			the murder would have no honor.
			K'mpec believed the assassin to
			be either Duras or Gowron.
			I know little of Gowron. Only
			that he is an outsider who has
			often challenged the council.
			But Duras... I know him... his
			heart is not Klingon.
			That's Gowron.
			I hope this is brief.
			It will be just long enough to
			prove that K'mpec is dead.
			Qab... jIH... nagil (Face me if
			you dare!)
			Qab jIH nagil!
			Qab jiH nagil!
			Sonchi. (He is dead)
			Now complete the Rite of
			Succession. It's obvious who
			the two challengers are.
			We will proceed according to the
			traditions and precedents set down
			in Klingon law.
			What do you know of Klingon law,
			Human?
			We will reconvene on the
			Enterprise within---
			No! Finish it here, now!
			I... have not received your report
			on the explosion.
			Two Klingons killed... a few minor
			injuries.
			Were you concerned about me?
			As head of security... it is my
			duty to be concerned.
			Is that it? Just official concern
			for my well-being?
			You know my... feelings.
			Maybe I've forgotten.
			You were right... I would have
			insisted that we take the oath.
			But not just because of
			tradition...
			I thought about telling you...
			wanted to tell you. I wasn't
			ready.
			When I left, you said you'd never
			be complete without me. It took
			some time... but I came to
			realize... I need you too. You're
			part of me, Worf.
			jIH dok (My blood)
			maj dok (Our blood)
			I cannot allow you to... suffer
			my humiliation.
			There would be no suffering...
			I don't care what other Klingons
			think of you.
			But what of the boy? He may want
			to live in the Empire someday.
			He would be an outcast... another
			traitor from a family of traitors.
			"Family of traitors?" I don't
			believe that for a minute.
			Respect my wishes in this matter.
			I cannot take the oath with you...
			And I cannot claim your son.
			If you cannot be his father...
			at least be his friend.
			We haven't completed our analysis
			of the bomb debris... and Doctor
			Crusher is still studying the
			remains of the two men killed in
			the explosion.
			We need more time.
			Duras and Gowron will be here in
			a few minutes. I don't think you
			can delay this meeting again.
			Is there some way of stretching
			out the formalities once they
			arrive?
			In the modern Rite of Succession,
			only a brief proclamation that
			two challengers have been chosen
			is necessary.
			You said "modern Rite"... how was
			the ritual performed in the past?
			The old forms dictated that the
			challengers perform the ja'chuq.
			It's a long, involved ceremony
			where the challengers list the
			battles they've won, the prizes
			they've taken... the idea is to
			prove their worthiness to lead
			the Council.
			Can the old form still be used?
			It's up to you... you can use
			any form you want.
			Captain... What do you know about
			Worf's discommendation?
			My interest is... personal. I
			understand that you were there...
			you stood by him before the
			Council. I'd like to know what
			happened.
			I'm sorry... but I cannot discuss
			it.
			The Council must have a leader...
			now!
			Complete the rite so I can kill
			this ha'DIbah.
			You will die slowly, Duras.
			You've already proved you don't
			have the courage to face me...
			perhaps you should plant another
			bomb...
			mev yap! (Stop!)
			Sit down.
			We will begin the ja'chuq.
			What!
			This woman is giving you bad
			advice, Picard. The ja'chuq is
			obsolete.
			I choose to respect the ancient
			ritual. Each of you must prove
			your worthiness to lead the High
			Council.
			That will take hours!
			Or days... depending on your
			cooperation.
			Kathless... the Unforgettable...
			he united the Homeworld in the
			year...
			A tricorder...
			It is operated by activating
			the...
			It is a bat'telh.
			It belonged to my father... it
			has been in our family for ten
			generations.
			Let me hold it.
			No.
			Do not think of it as a weapon...
			make it part of your hand... your
			arm... make it part of you.
			The next meeting is in three
			hours.
			I would speak with you alone,
			Ambassador.
			I'm honored.
			Picard is prolonging the ja'chuq.
			Why?
			He has sufficient reason to
			proceed carefully.
			He relies on you for his knowledge
			of Klingon law...
			Yes.
			Then he values your advice. You
			could quicken the pace.
			Possibly. Why should I?
			Your position is... unique. Have
			you never wondered about serving
			the Klingon Empire?
			I serve in my own way.
			As a Federation Ambassador.
			A few rewards... but little
			glory.
			What do you want?
			What do you want? Command of a
			ship... a seat on the Council?
			There are many opportunities for
			you in the Empire.
			Opportunities that will present
			themselves only if you come to
			power. You talk like a Ferengi.
			K'mpec was also stubborn... he
			too refused to listen... now he's
			gone... you need not make the same
			mistake.
			K'mpec was old and weak... I am
			not.
			We've completed our analysis of
			the bomb debris.
			The explosive was a triceron
			derivative.
			The entire device couldn't have
			been more than three cubic
			millimeters in size...
			Then it could have been hidden
			anywhere in the room.
			There's one other thing,
			Commander... The bomb had a
			molecular-decay detonator.
			Only one race uses that device,
			sir...
			The Romulans.
			How could Romulans have planted
			a bomb aboard a Klingon attack
			cruiser?
			It would be impossible.
			Not if the Romulans had help...
			from one of the Klingons.
			Klingons and Romulans working
			together? They've been blood
			enemies for seventy-five years.
			Perhaps Duras or Gowron wishes
			to improve that relationship.
			A new Klingon alliance with the
			Romulans?
			If true, it would represent a
			fundamental shift of power in the
			quadrant.
			Indeed.
			It would put the Federation in
			a very uncomfortable position.
			Gowron or Duras?
			Gowron came to me alone... wanted
			me to speed up the ja'chuq...
			offered me a seat on the Council
			if I'd help him.
			But does that suggest a Romulan
			connection?
			He also implied that I would end
			up like K'mpec if I didn't
			cooperate.
			Captain... I disagree. It must
			be Duras.
			Why?
			We have had prior dealings with
			Duras that showed him to be...
			untrustworthy.
			Can you be more specific?
			No.
			Mister Worf, we now have a
			conspiracy on our hands that
			could be a direct threat to the
			security of the Federation.
			Yes sir.
			As Chief Security Officer, you
			will accompany me to the next
			transition proceeding.
			Captain, they will be incensed.
			My presence will be...
			disruptive.
			Yes. It will.
			Deck Twenty-Three.
			Halt.
			You suspect Duras. Why?
			I cannot---
			Don't tell me that again! I'm
			trying to do my job while you
			withhold vital information...
			I will not discuss this with you
			or anyone else.
			Captain Picard seems well-
			informed.
			There's more at stake here than
			your personal honor.
			I am aware of what is at stake
			here!
			But you're still willing to hide
			the truth!
			I am hiding nothing!
			You're hiding everything, just
			like you always do... behind that
			precious Klingon honor. Why?
			Because you don't have the courage
			to face life without clinging to
			some archaic ritual?
			Exit.
			Computer, list stardates of the
			last Enterprise mission to the
			Klingon home planet.
			Stardates 43685 through 43689.
			How many ship's logs during that
			period?
			Forty-three officer's logs. Ten
			personal logs.
			Is there a personal log for
			Lieutenant Worf?
			Affirmative. Access is
			restricted.
			Eliminate all personal logs.
			List the other forty-three in
			chronological order... we'll
			take them one at a time...
			jIH DoQ batlh! (I claim the
			honor!)
			Both your claims have been
			properly made and recorded. We
			are ready for the final phase of
			the ja'chuq. There will be a
			recess while I review your
			petitions.
			I know that you're as concerned
			as I am about the explosion
			aboard K'mpec's ship. I assume
			both of your investigations are
			continuing...
			The investigations are complete.
			They revealed nothing of any
			importance.
			That's very interesting... because
			our analysis turned up some
			startling results.
			Will you join us?
			He has no place here, Picard!
			I will not sit at the same table
			with that!
			It is my prerogative to
			investigate anything relevant to
			the Rite of Succession.
			Lieutenant Worf is my chief of
			security. His presence is
			required.
			We will not proceed...
			I will determine how we proceed.
			If you wish to withdraw from the
			ja'chuq... that is your option.
			What did your investigations
			reveal about the explosion?
			It was a bomb.
			Was your analysis just as...
			insightful?
			It was a common explosive.
			What type?
			Triceron.
			What about the detonator?
			This is pointless! The findings
			were inconclusive.
			Fortunately, our investigation
			was more... thorough.
			The bomb used a molecular-decay
			detonator.
			What!
			A Romulan device.
			I will return to my ship. I want
			to confirm these... conclusions
			myself.
			As will I.
			Lieutenant, please be sure to send
			a complete record of our findings
			to both vessels... and to the High
			Council.
			We are adjourned.
			...Khitomer...
			Computer, why was the Enterprise
			crew studying the transmission
			logs from the Khitomer outpost?
			Reference Chief Engineer's entry,
			stardate 43686.1. Certain
			transmission logs between the
			Khitomer outpost and the Romulan
			patrol ships were altered after
			the destruction of the colony.
			Altered. By whom?
			That information is not available.
			Computer, interlock with the
			Klingon Imperial information net.
			Interlock established.
			Federation Ambassador K'Ehleyr
			requesting diplomatic access to
			High Council record. Security
			code pah doQ cha!
			Proceed.
			Computer, display summary of the
			most recent High Council inquiry
			regarding the Khitomer massacre.
			Access denied. Restricted
			materials, du-ko-cha clearance
			only.
			By whose order?
			Council member Duras.
			Access biographical files.
			Subject name: Councilor Duras.
			Advise my counselors on the Vorn
			to convene... there is much to
			discuss...
			What is that...
			Priority message to you from the
			home planet on a secure channel.
			Excuse me, sir...
			Sir, you cannot leave your
			quarters without an escort...
			I am not helpless. I don't need
			a Starfleet escort.
			I'm sorry, sir... Captain's
			orders. I'll be happy to call
			a security officer to accompany
			you...
			It's an outrage. An insult. I
			will return to quarters.
			Come.
			I have been informed of your
			attempt to access restricted
			Council records.
			I've been investigating what
			happened at Khitomer.
			Not an easy task... considering
			that most of the records are
			sealed...
			Worf's father was a traitor.
			No, the evidence was altered to
			make it appear that way.
			I found it interesting to read
			that your father was also at
			Khitomer. And you are the one
			who sealed the records.
			You would dare to insult my
			father's name?
			Don't play the wounded Klingon
			for me, Duras... you don't do it
			very well.
			What happened in the council
			chambers... how did you get Worf
			to take the blame for you...
			Do not pursue this matter
			further...
			The son betrays his people to
			the Romulans just as his father
			did... Eh, Duras?
			One of the Klingons who died in
			the explosion was with Duras...
			the other with Gowron. I've been
			examining the bodies... trying
			to get a clue to where the bomb
			was hidden.
			There's always a pattern to the
			lacerations and tissue damage.
			It would normally give us a clear
			indication of direction, distance,
			force of impact...
			'Normally'?
			In this case, the pattern was
			virtually impossible to
			identify... I couldn't understand
			it until I checked the
			dynascans...
			This wound is different from all
			the others... it was made from
			the inside out.
			The bomb was implanted in one of
			their forearms.
			It is considered an honorable
			way for a Klingon to die,
			Doctor... a suicide that also
			takes an enemy.
			Which one of them was it?
			Duras' man.
			When we have more time I will take
			you to the holodeck and
			demonstrate in more detail...
			Medical Emergency, Deck Eight,
			Room one-four-two!
			Gowron... ?
			Duras?
			Alexander...
			You have never seen death?
			Then look...
			And always remember.
			Stay with the doctor.
			Worf, when did you... ?
			Multiple stab wounds to the chest
			and abdomen... too much trauma
			to the internal organs. There
			wasn't enough time to get her into
			stasis.
			Where's Worf?
			I don't know... he left just after
			I got here.
			Riker to Worf.
			Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.
			Lieutenant Worf is not aboard the
			Enterprise.
			Where is he?
			Lieutenant Worf transported to
			the Klingon ship Vorn at
			seventeen-thirty hours.
			On my way.
			How could you let him in here?
			He has claimed the right of
			vengeance.
			You have no rights here, traitor!
			K'Ehleyr... was my mate.
			And if Lieutenant Worf resists,
			sir?
			He's coming back with us one way
			or another. Set phasers to
			maximum stun.
			I'm the only one, Worf... the only
			one who can prove your innocence.
			Kill me... and you will always
			be known as a traitor.
			Then that is how it shall be.
			Worf!
			Lieutenant, you are a fine
			officer... your service aboard
			this ship has been exemplary...
			Until now.
			Sir, I acted within the boundaries
			of Klingon law and tradition.
			The High Council seems to agree
			with you. They consider the
			matter to be closed.
			I do not.
			The Enterprise crew currently
			includes representatives from
			thirteen planets, Mister Worf.
			They each have their individual
			beliefs and values and I respect
			them all. But every member of
			the crew has chosen to serve
			Starfleet. If anyone cannot
			perform his duties because of the
			demands of his society, he must
			resign.
			Do you wish to resign, Lieutenant?
			Captain...
			I would hope you would not throw
			away a promising career.
			No sir.
			I understand your pain... we all
			felt very close to K'Ehleyr.
			A reprimand will be on your
			record. Dismissed.
			Worf...
			Isn't it time for the truth about
			your father's innocence to be
			told? After all, the reasons you
			accepted this dishonor were to
			protect the name of Duras, and
			hold the Empire together. Now
			that he's died in disgrace...
			where is the honor in further
			silence?
			Each member of the Klingon high
			council shared in that lie. They
			will not be so willing to admit
			their own dishonor.
			But the day will come when my
			brother and I will... "convince"
			them to speak the truth.
			My parents... my human parents
			will meet us at Starbase
			Seventy-Three. They will care
			for you.
			Why can't I stay with you?
			You deserve a home... a family.
			My parents can provide that...
			I cannot.
			I miss her too.
			Are you my father?
			Yes... I am your father.
