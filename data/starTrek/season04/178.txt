			Captain's Log: Stardate 44009.3
			The Enterprise remains docked at
			McKinley Station, undergoing a
			major overhaul and refit. I am
			confident that the ship... and
			crew... will soon be ready to
			return to service.
			Come in.
			Phaser upgrades are complete,
			Commander...
			Already?
			We have begun power supply
			calibration.
			You're just too damned efficient,
			Lieutenant...
			Thank-you, sir.
			At this rate, the refit will be
			done a week early and you and I
			might even be forced to get in
			some R&R before we leave Earth...
			Proceed with the testing, Mister
			Worf...
			Here's the final schedule for
			shore leave and personnel
			transfers. By the way, I'm
			looking forward to meeting your
			parents.
			Sir?
			They're on the visitors' list...
			You didn't know?
			No, sir.
			It is... inappropriate for a
			Klingon to receive his family
			while on duty. As humans, my
			parents do not understand.
			Well, I'm not sure I would either,
			Worf... since this isn't a Klingon
			ship. If you don't want to see
			your parents, that's your
			business... but we don't get to
			Earth all that often.
			I'm sure we can arrange for you
			to have more off-duty time while
			they're here.
			No... sir. That will not be
			necessary.
			Dismissed.
			Worf, if you're worried they might
			learn about what happened on the
			Klingon planet...
			Not at all, sir. I have already
			informed them in correspondence
			of my discommendation. I do not
			believe any human can truly
			understand my dishonor.
			France. Labarre, my home
			village...
			Really...
			First time in almost twenty
			years...
			Interesting.
			Counselor...
			I just find it interesting... 
			that Captain Jean-Luc Picard... 
			the man who couldn't be pried out
			of his seat for a vacation for
			three years...
			It's Earth... it's home... do I
			need another reason?
			I don't know. What do you think?
			Counselor, your help has been
			invaluable during my recovery.
			I'm better... the injuries have
			healed...
			Those you can see in a mirror.
			The nightmares have ended. All
			I need is a little time to myself.
			I agree. In fact, I'm delighted
			you're going. But perhaps the
			choice of where you're going could
			stand some scrutiny.
			If you wish to believe my going
			home is a direct result of
			being held captive by the Borg,
			be my guest...
			Is that what you believe?
			I hate it when you do that.
			Captain, you do need time. You
			cannot achieve complete recovery
			so quickly. Don't expect so much
			of yourself. It is perfectly
			normal, after what you've been
			through, to spend a great deal
			of time trying to find... yourself
			again.
			And what better place to find
			oneself than on the streets of
			one's home village.
			Interesting.
			Have a good trip.
			They still have not signalled?
			Nossir.
			My mother is never on time. It
			is so... human... of her.
			Well, you know women.
			I am not looking forward to
			this... I wish they would come
			so it would begin and end sooner.
			I know what you mean, Lieutenant.
			Unlikely.
			Last time my old man came on board
			I found him chasing Nurse Stanton
			around a biobed in Sickbay...
			I am not concerned about my father
			chasing nurses.
			Yeah, but it's always something
			with parents, isn't it, sir...
			Enterprise, this is Earth Station
			Bobruisk. Two to transport
			aboard.
			What are you waiting for?
			Acknowledged, Bobruisk.
			Energizing.
			Hello, mother... father.
			Worf!...
			You look good, son.
			Put on a little weight, didn't
			you?
			No.
			Sure you have. Looks good on you.
			Still working out with those
			Holodeck monsters I bet...
			Let me take you to...
			Always good to meet another chief
			petty officer.
			Sergey Rozhenko, formerly of the
			U.S.S. Intrepid.
			Miles Edward O'Brien. Good to
			meet you, sir.
			Don't call me "sir", I used to
			work for a living.
			He's joking. The proudest day
			of his life was when Worf earned
			his commission.
			Chief, can you imagine an old
			enlisted man like me raising a
			boy to be an officer?
			I'll show you to your quarters.
			Come on, Sergey... there's plenty
			of time to chat with the "boys"...
			Your father's so been looking
			forward to this...
			I want to see everything... the
			whole ship... I've got all the
			specs and diagrams of the Galaxy-
			class starships at home...
			We are in the midst of repair.
			I will not be able to give you
			a complete tour.
			I'm sure if you asked the
			Captain...
			You agreed not to embarrass him,
			Sergey. Besides, we came to see
			Worf. Not the ship.
			Fine. Fine. Okay.
			Your hair's a little longer, isn't
			it, Worf?
			All right... whoever's there...
			I can hear you...
			Good lord, a highwayman.
			A what?
			A highwayman is a robber who
			attacks travelers, but to my
			knowledge, none have been reported
			in this vicinity for centuries.
			I'm not a robber.
			I am much relieved, sir.
			I know who you are.
			Then, you have the advantage.
			You're my nephew, Jean-Luc. From
			the starship Enterprise.
			Then you must be my uncle Rene.
			I'm not your uncle. It's the
			other way around.
			Too bad. I rather enjoyed the
			idea.
			Why have you been away so long?
			Well, Starfleet keeps me very
			busy...
			Father says you don't like it
			here.
			I'm sure you misunderstood...
			No I didn't. He said so.
			Ah well, Robert and I... we...
			Perhaps it's time to change all
			that.
			You don't seem so... so arrow... 
			arrow... you know...
			Arrogant...
			Yeah... arrogant... you don't seem
			that way to me. What does it mean
			anyway -- "arrogant son-of-a... "
			Let's talk about it later, shall
			we?
			He's here! He's here!
			Jean-Luc!
			Marie...
			It's so good to finally meet you.
			How are you feeling?
			Just fine.
			Well, Robert and I are delighted
			you've come to stay with us.
			I was just thinking that I really
			might be imposing... I could
			easily stay in the village...
			I won't hear of it. It's your
			home. It will always be your
			home.
			Do things look that different?
			No. In fact, the amazing thing
			is how little it has changed.
			Everything is exactly as I
			remember it... the hills, the
			house, every rock and stone looks
			untouched by the passage of time.
			Robert's worked hard to keep it
			that way. It's very important
			to him.
			As it was to our father.
			Someday I'm going to be a starship
			captain!
			Even you, Uncle... you look so
			much like Robert when he was your
			age...
			... I half expect to see myself
			as a boy run out the door to
			play...
			Robert can't wait to see you...
			Yes. Rene already told me.
			Where is he?
			So, you've arrived all right.
			Welcome home, Captain.
			Hello, Robert.
			Did you shuttle out from the
			village?
			No... I decided to walk.
			I met Marie and Rene.
			Good... good.
			It's... good to see you.
			Make yourself at home. You know
			where everything is... we eat at
			eight. I'll be in in a minute.
			I've got to save this poor, sick
			vine.
			Will you have a chance to get
			down to the surface?
			Maybe. Will and I have been
			talking about going back to Angel
			Falls...
			Oh, Venezuela's beautiful...
			Come in.
			Oh great! I'll take that.
			Something from home?
			I left it here in storage a long
			time ago. After Jack died.
			Odds and ends mostly...
			"How to Advance Your Career
			through Marriage"?
			It's a joke. He sent me that
			while I was still in medical
			school. It was his way of
			proposing.
			What is it?
			It's for Wesley... from Jack.
			I'd forgotten about it... maybe
			I was trying to forget about it.
			Why?
			Jack recorded a holographic
			message to Wesley just after he
			was born... it was a gift for
			when he grew up. Jack was going
			to make more of them...
			He never got the chance.
			Are you afraid of what it might
			say?
			No... I just don't know if it will
			do more harm than good. He's
			managed to finally deal with his
			father's death, but...
			Wesley has a lot of questions
			about his father. Things that
			you can't answer for him.
			Perhaps seeing this will help him
			to understand the kind of man that
			Jack Crusher really was.
			... So we walk into the school... 
			and we don't know what to expect.
			Is Worf hurt? Is he in some kind
			of trouble? The door opens and
			we see our little seven-year-
			old... sitting in a chair... and
			glaring across the room at five
			teenage boys.
			All of them with bloody noses.
			The principal looked up and said,
			"Tell me he's an only child."
			The older boys were... 
			disrespectful.
			And that was only the beginning... 
			when he was ten...
			We've taken enough of the
			Commander's time...
			No... no... no, we're way ahead
			of schedule...
			I just wanted to tell him the
			story about...
			Enough stories, Sergey...
			Okay. Okay. Enough stories... 
			Well, then how about giving me
			a look at the new engine core ...
			I used to be a warp field
			specialist on the old Excelsior
			class.
			I'd be delighted...
			You two go ahead...
			Your father will be here for
			hours, why don't you show me the
			arboretum?
			Commander La Forge, call me when
			you... when my father wishes to
			leave.
			I can find my own way...
			Turbolift Four is just over there,
			right?
			I have all the specs and designs
			at home...
			The theta-matrix compositer makes
			the recrystallization process ten
			times more efficient than on the
			Excelsior-class ships.
			Amazing.
			Commander, if you have a couple
			of minutes there's something else
			I'd like to ask you.
			Sure, Chief.
			It's about... my son.
			And your friend Louis wants you
			to contact him as soon as you're
			settled...
			Is he still trying to raise the
			ocean floor?
			Oh yes, he's very excited about
			it... he's been made a supervisor
			now... as his wife is constantly
			reminding anyone who'll listen...
			I don't see why Earth needs
			another subcontinent.
			Oh, it's really quite exciting
			actually... when you understand
			the potential of exploring a new
			world on our own planet...
			Well, I guess I just don't
			understand that potential.
			The Mayor wants to have a
			parade...
			A parade... ?
			And give you the keys to the
			city...
			No... no...
			A little arm-twisting... a little
			coaxing, that's what he wants,
			Marie.
			No. I don't. I just want... to
			rest and spend some time with my
			family.
			I've already warned the Mayor not
			to make any plans until we
			talked.
			Thank-you.
			Is this the forty-six?
			Forty-seven.
			Drinking all that artificial --
			what do they call it? Synthehol?
			-- It's spoiled you. You used
			to have a very discriminating
			palate.
			Not at all. I believe synthehol
			heightens one's appreciation for
			the genuine article.
			Delicious, Marie.
			Leave it to Robert to find the
			best chef in France and marry
			her...
			Cooking is becoming a lost art...
			thanks to your technology...
			Robert and I have had more than
			a few discussions about getting
			a replicator in the house...
			I can remember the same
			"discussions" between mother and
			father...
			He understood the threat of losing
			what is precious to us.
			I don't see that you have to lose
			anything... just by adding a
			convenience...
			You wouldn't. I say life has
			become too convenient.
			And this sounds like a very old
			argument.
			It is.
			Fortunately, Jean-Luc, being the
			"greatest chef" in France, I
			enjoy traditional cooking... so
			I don't mind losing the replicator
			argument... especially since I
			used it to get a sonic shower.
			I was astonished to see it here...
			I don't use it. Never will.
			I wrote a report on starships for
			school.
			And he won a ribbon for it, isn't
			that right, Rene...
			The teacher said it was one of
			the best he'd ever heard.
			Good for you, uncle. You know
			what? I wrote a report about
			starships when I was about your
			age...
			Did you win a ribbon too?
			I don't recall...
			Your modesty is unconvincing,
			Captain. Of course you won the
			ribbon. You always did...
			Do you still have it?
			Your report.
			No, I don't think so.
			I still have mine.
			Why don't you go get it, Rene...
			and read it to your uncle?
			It is hard enough to protect him
			from all that's out there without
			your encouragement.
			Robert...
			I am not encouraging anything...
			but if you weren't so
			narrow-minded, if you allowed him
			to see the real world...
			Raise your own sons as you would
			wish.
			"Starships... by Rene Picard.
			There are many kinds of starships
			that fly through space... but the
			biggest of them all is the Galaxy
			class-starship... It has over
			a thousand people on board... "
			One man's idea of paradise.
			Two men. Robert's. And my
			father's.
			Never did I know anyone less
			interested in grapes than you,
			Jean-Luc.
			No, I was interested, Louis. And
			I was proud that my family helped
			to preserve the traditions. But
			I did not feel bound by those
			traditions...
			... as they seemed to be.
			You always reach for the future.
			Your brother for the past.
			There should be room for both in
			this life.
			And you, old rascal, you've made
			quite a shift toward the future
			yourself...
			Well, hydroponics turned out to
			be so dull...
			You should have listened to me
			from the beginning.
			If I had listened to you I never
			would have gone on that cycling
			trip with the Bloom sisters...
			And broken your leg!
			And got married. Twice.
			I hear you've been promoted to
			supervisor of the Atlantis
			project...
			I'm one of two hundred
			supervisors... although my wife
			would have you believe I run the
			entire project.
			It's certainly exciting work.
			I've kept up with it in the
			journals...
			Really?
			There's only one thing I don't
			understand...
			It's just that you were such a
			desperately poor swimmer...
			thinking of you working on the
			ocean floor...
			I guess we all find a way to
			confront our greatest fears.
			Seriously, how do you plan to
			accelerate the buildup on the
			underside of the mantle without
			increasing stress on the tectonic
			plates?
			You really have kept up, haven't
			you? The truth is... we don't
			know yet...
			The Enterprise used harmonic
			resonators to relieve tectonic
			pressures on Drema Four... it's
			obviously not exactly the same
			problem but...
			You know, it's a shame...
			The government's been looking for
			some one to take over the
			project... a real leader who can
			come in and get it moving...
			They're looking for you, Jean-Luc.
			But I know you'd never leave
			Starfleet.
			No, I'd never leave Starfleet.
			That's what I thought.
			Hey, if nothing else, why don't
			I send over some of the internal
			studies of the tectonic problem...
			since you're interested... We
			could use any thoughts you might
			have...
			All right.
			It's a great crew, Worf... and
			they think the world of you...
			They really do...
			Mother, Father... I wish you would
			be a little more... reserved...
			while you're aboard.
			Oh, I know we go too far
			sometimes...
			We're just excited to be here.
			Riker to Lieutenant Worf.
			Go ahead.
			I need to talk to you about the
			phaser test results...
			On my way, Commander.
			Have Guinan call me if you need
			anything...
			Maybe we should just leave it
			alone.
			I can't leave it alone. I'm his
			mother.
			Sooner or later, everyone comes
			in here, stands by the windows...
			stares out into space for a long
			time.
			They all look for that one star,
			the one they call home... doesn't
			matter how far away it is...
			everyone still looks.
			You're Worf's parents?
			Sergey... Helena Rozhenko
			Guinan. I've been wanting to
			ask you something.
			Please...
			How come you never gave him prune
			juice?
			I beg your pardon?
			Worf... he never had prune juice
			until he came in here... now he
			can't get enough of it...
			Worf?
			He didn't want any human foods
			growing up... everything had to
			be Klingon...
			I learned to cook rokeg blood
			pie...
			We never quite learned how to eat
			it though.
			It was a difficult adolescence.
			You ought to write a book.
			We didn't do anything special.
			You don't think so? Look at him
			now... I think that's pretty
			special...
			We knew it wouldn't be easy for
			him... without other Klingons to
			look to for guidance...
			We let him discover and explore
			his heritage for himself... let
			him find his own path...
			A lot of parents could learn a
			few things from the two of you...
			I'm afraid Worf thinks we don't
			understand him...
			Because we're human, you know,
			not Klingon.
			Maybe a part of him believes that.
			But there's another part of him
			I've seen... the part that drinks
			prune juice... and comes here to
			the window... when he looks out
			for home, he doesn't look toward
			the Klingon Empire. He's looking
			toward you.
			Jean-Luc?
			Are you all right?
			Actually... I seem to have made
			a disturbing discovery...
			Louis mentioned the Atlantis
			project needed a director... and
			I actually found myself thinking
			about it.
			But that would be wonderful,
			Jean-Luc...
			Do you think so?
			Having you back home... of
			course...
			Marie, I spent my youth doing
			everything I could to get away
			from home...
			You've been as narrow-minded as
			your brother... and it's time both
			of you began to appreciate each
			other's worlds...
			I can't argue with that.
			Given a little time, you might
			even get to like one another.
			Well, I already like his choice
			of wives. I haven't thanked you
			for your correspondence, it made
			me feel like part of the family.
			You're not like part of the
			family. You are part of the
			family, Jean-Luc Picard.
			Robert...
			Hello, Louis.
			Come in, Louis... I'll get you
			some wine...
			The two of you can talk
			business...
			Business?
			Well, there's really nothing to
			talk about...
			I'm interested to know what you
			thought about our plans.
			I've just really had a chance to
			glance at them... I have a few
			ideas but...
			Wonderful. We should discuss them
			with the board of governors...
			I've set up a meeting...
			A meeting... ?
			Just a preliminary conversation...
			tomorrow morning...
			Preliminary to what?
			They want you. I mentioned your
			interest in the project, that's
			all. That's all I had to say.
			They jumped at the prospect...
			I never said there was a
			prospect...
			At least, listen to them,
			Jean-Luc.
			Fine. Good. I'll listen to
			them.
			You won't regret it, Jean-Luc.
			I promise you. I'll see you in
			the morning...
			What kind of message?
			I don't know exactly. Your father
			made it a few weeks after you were
			born.
			Why?
			He thought it was important to
			say certain things... to make sure
			that he didn't forget to tell you
			later.
			Do you know what it says?
			No.
			He wanted you to have this when
			you turned eighteen... and I want
			you to have it too.
			Enter.
			Are we disturbing you?
			No. I thought you were going to
			your quarters to sleep.
			We just came by to tuck you in.
			When I heard you were on the
			visitors' list, I was... not sure
			I wanted you to come.
			I am glad you are here.
			We had to come.
			Our boy was in trouble.
			After we read your letter...
			about your discommendation from
			the Klingons...
			We don't exactly understand it
			all...
			We don't have to. We know what
			kind of man you are...
			Whatever you did, we know it was
			for a good reason.
			My reasons can never be told.
			Your crewmates... your friends...
			they tell us you're... upset,
			Worf.
			I must bear my dishonor alone.
			That's not true.
			I'm sorry if this is too human
			of us... but whenever you are
			suffering, you must remember...
			we are with you.
			And that we're proud of you, and
			love you.
			You're our son.
			Careful... you're not used to
			drinking the real thing.
			Your... synthenol... never leaves
			you out of control, isn't that
			so...
			That is so.
			This will.
			Now there's something I'd like
			to see.
			What's that?
			Jean-Luc Picard out of control.
			I venture you've probably never
			been drunk in your entire life.
			I have nothing but pity for those
			who abuse any substance.
			As do I. And yet see how you fill
			your glass 
			Mind if I make an observation?
			Yes.
			I'll make it anyway. You've
			changed.
			What the devil happened to you
			up there?
			Is that "brotherly" concern?
			No. I'm just curious what makes
			a man change so much... what did
			they do to you anyway?
			You know what happened.
			Not everything... I gather you
			were hurt... humiliated... I
			always said you could use a little
			humiliation or was it humility,
			well, either one...
			I don't want to do this with
			you...
			Why walk away? That was never
			your style...
			I'm tired of fighting with you,
			Robert...
			Pity. Tired...
			That's right.
			Tired of the Enterprise too.
			Captain Picard, icon of Starfleet,
			falls to Earth, ready to jump in
			the water with Louis. This is
			not the brother I remember...
			It seemed the ideal situation for
			you -- local boy makes good,
			returns home after twenty years
			for a hero's welcome.
			I am not a hero...
			Certainly you are... you wouldn't
			settle for anything less... admit
			it, never could, and you never
			did.
			That isn't true.
			Of course it is. Turn down a
			parade in your honor? You?
			I've never sought recognition...
			Never? And what of the school
			president, the valedictorian, the
			athletic hero... arms raised in
			victory...
			Were you so jealous?
			Dammit, I had a right to be.
			A right...
			I was always your brother...
			watching you get the cheers...
			watching you break every one of
			father's rules and getting away
			with it...
			Why didn't you break a few rules?
			I was the older one, the
			responsible one. I had to look
			after you...
			You were a bully...
			It was such a pleasure to bully
			you...
			Try it again.
			Did you come back because you
			need me to look after you
			again... ?
			You were asking for it, you know.
			Yes, but you needed it. You
			have been terribly hard on
			yourself.
			You don't know, Robert. You don't
			know. They took everything I was.
			They used me to kill and destroy.
			And I could not stop them. I
			should have been able to stop
			them.
			I tried... I tried... so hard...
			but I just wasn't strong enough.
			Not good enough. I should have
			been able to stop them. I should
			have been able to...
			So, Jean-Luc Picard is human
			after all.
			This is going to be with you a
			long time, Jean-Luc. A long time.
			And you have to learn to live
			with that. You have a simple
			choice now -- living with it
			below the sea with Louis or above
			the clouds on your Enterprise.
			You know, I think you were right.
			Maybe I did come back so you'd
			look after me.
			I still don't like you.
			What in the world... ?
			What happened here?
			Ah...
			It's entirely my fault, Marie...
			Yes, you see, he fell... and then
			I fell...
			We both fell together...
			Have you two been fighting?
			Fighting? Oh, you mean this.
			There's a perfectly good
			explanation for this...
			Shame on you both. What would
			your father say if he saw you like
			this?
			He'd probably send us to bed
			without our supper.
			Well, perhaps it was good to get
			it out of your system.
			Perhaps it was, Marie. Perhaps
			it was.
			I'll contact Louis and cancel the
			meeting with the Board of
			Governors. It's time for me to
			be going...
			Already, Jean-Luc?
			The ship will be ready to leave
			orbit soon... and I belong on
			board.
			If I ever doubt that again... I
			know where to come.
			You can't leave yet.
			I'm sorry. I must.
			You're not leaving until you clean
			up this mess... both of you...
			What mess?
			Yes, ma'am...
			Computer, load program, Crusher
			One.
			Program loaded.
			Run program.
			Hello, Wesley. As I make this
			recording, you're just ten weeks
			old.
			I want you to know who I am today.
			You see, this Jack Crusher won't
			exist by the time you're grown
			up... I'll be older, more
			experienced... hopefully a little
			wiser. But this person will be
			gone and I wanted you to know who
			I am now, who your father was when
			you came into this world.
			I see you lying there in your
			crib... and I realize that I don't
			know the first thing about being
			a father. So let me just
			apologize for all the mistakes
			I'm about to make as you grow up.
			I hope you don't grow up...
			resenting the fact that I was gone
			so much. That comes with this
			uniform. Right now, I'm waiting
			for an assignment on the U.S.S.
			Stargazer. I don't know if I can
			explain why Starfleet is so
			important to me... maybe you'll
			understand when you get this...
			later on.
			Maybe you'll even want to try one
			of these on.
			You'll probably be a doctor like
			your mother.
			We named you after Richard Wesley
			Crusher, my grandfather, who gave
			me my first flying lesson as a
			boy. You come from a fine
			family... of scholars, explorers,
			artists... your great-great
			grandfather was a painter whose
			work once hung in the Prado...
			We've had a skeleton or two in
			our closet... someday, I'll tell
			you about the Crusher who was a
			horse thief on Nimbus Three...
			but we also had our share of
			family heroes... a Crusher fought
			for the Confederacy at Bull Run.
			One died at Station Salem One.
			It's a proud heritage, Wesley...
			one for you to pass on to your
			children.
			You're only a baby... but it's
			remarkable... I see in your face
			all the people I've loved in my
			lifetime... your mother... my
			father and mother... our family.
			I see me in you, too. I can
			feel that you're my son. I don't
			know how to describe it...
			There's this connection, this
			bond... I will always be a part
			of you, Wes...
			Well, I hope this made some sense
			to you... I'm not sure it does
			to me. Maybe I'll do better next
			time. I love you, Wesley.
			Good-bye, Dad.
			Be careful, Jean-Luc. Come back
			to us again.
			Take care, Uncle.
			Someday, I'll be leaving for my
			ship too.
			There's plenty of time for that...
			keep your mind open... you may
			decide to do something else as
			you get older.
			Try not to be so... narrow-minded.
			Here, Jean-Luc. A little of the
			fifty-one.
			Do not drink it all at once.
			And try not to drink it alone.
			Is there anything you want us to
			send you from home?
			No...
			Perhaps some of your rokeg blood
			pie...
			It's been a while, but I think
			I still remember how.
			Captain... welcome back.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Captain, these are my parents.
			Sergey and Helena Rozhenko.
			Delighted.
			Quite a ship you have here,
			Captain.
			You got the full tour, I trust...
			Well, actually, there are still
			a few areas because of the
			repairs...
			Sergey, it's time to go...
			Yes. Yes. Okay.
			I have all the specs and diagrams
			at home...
			He's still out there... dreaming
			about starships and adventures.
			It's getting late.
			Yes... but let him dream.
