			Captain's log, stardate 45854.2.
			The Enterprise is charting six
			star systems that make up the
			Argolis cluster, an area being
			considered for colonization.
			Very impressive...
			It's beautiful... and frightening
			at the same time.
			Radiation bursts from the star's
			surface are making precise sensor
			readings difficult. It seems to
			be exhibiting gravitational
			instability.
			The star's fluctuations are too
			severe. It would be impossible
			to settle any of the planets
			in this system.
			I suggest we proceed to the next
			system. Its sun is a stable main
			sequence star.
			In a moment, Mister Data.
			Sir, I am detecting a
			transmission... emanating from
			within this system
			What kind of signal?
			It is self-repeating... of unknown
			pattern.
			Where is it coming from?
			A small moon orbiting the fourth
			planet.
			Life signs?
			Indeterminate. I am attempting
			to screen out sensor
			interference...
			Readings are still inconclusive;
			however, the moon's atmosphere is
			capable of supporting life.
			Then it could be a distress call.
			Helm, take us into transport
			range.
			Doctor Crusher, we need a medical
			away team in transporter room two.
			Acknowledged.
			I'm reading one life form... very
			weak signs.
			Riker to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			We've found the wreckage of a
			small craft... and one survivor.
			It's a Borg.
			Male, adolescent -- he's badly
			hurt.
			There is no indication of other
			Borg activity within sensor range.
			Away team, prepare to return to
			the ship.
			We can't leave him here, he won't
			survive.
			I think the captain understands
			that.
			Then I don't.
			The Borg usually collect their
			dead --
			He's not dead --
			And that transmission --
			-- at least not yet --
			That transmission we intercepted
			was probably a homing signal.
			We have to assume they're on their
			way.
			At least let me stabilize his
			condition, give him a chance of
			surviving until they get here.
			Captain?
			Your concern is noted, Doctor.
			But any intervention on your part
			would only alert the Borg to our
			having been here.
			I'm afraid we've already turned
			that corner.
			Kill it. Now. We could make it
			appear that it died in the crash
			-- leave no evidence that we were
			here.
			Security measures must be taken
			before we beam it on board.
			Standing by...
			Mister Data, notify security to
			prepare a detention cell.
			Bridge to engineering.
			La Forge here.
			We're bringing a Borg survivor
			on board. We'll need to
			neutralize the homing signal --
			-- prevent it from sending or
			receiving transmissions of any
			kind.
			I'll set up a subspace damping
			field around the detention cell.
			There are four others. None
			survived.
			Picard to Riker.
			Go ahead, Enterprise.
			We're transporting you directly
			to the detention cell.
			I need him in sickbay --
			The cell, Doctor. Whatever
			equipment you need will be brought
			to you there.
			Very well.
			Come.
			Captain... I just wondered if
			there's anything you wanted to
			talk about.
			I don't think so, Counselor.
			I would have thought that
			having a Borg on the ship would
			stir some feelings...
			I am quite recovered from my
			experience, thank you.
			Sometimes... even when a victim
			has dealt with his assault...
			there are residual effects of the
			event that linger. You were
			treated violently by the Borg...
			kidnapped, assaulted, mutilated
			--
			Counselor --
			Counselor, I very much appreciate
			your concern for me. But I assure
			you, it is misplaced.
			I have carefully considered the
			implications of having this Borg
			on the ship. I have weighed the
			possible risks, and I am convinced
			we've done the right thing.
			I am quite comfortable with my
			decision.
			I see. Well, if at any point you
			want to talk more...
			I will certainly avail myself of
			your help.
			Lower the force field.
			Captain, the Borg is still
			unconscious.
			He suffered massive internal
			injuries. We've got the
			hemorrhaging under control, but
			some of the implants in his brain
			were damaged. I may have to
			remove them.
			The Borg will die if they're
			removed permanently. Their brains
			grow dependent on the biochips.
			Perhaps Geordi could construct
			new implants...
			They contain relatively
			straightforward programming,
			interface protocols... we have
			the files we downloaded after your
			experience, sir. I think I could
			manage it.
			Mister La Forge... do you have
			enought knowledge of Borg
			programming to alter the pathways
			to the root command structure?
			I'm not sure, sir. The
			subroutines are pretty
			complicated... I'd probably have
			to study their data processing
			algorithms... that's the only way
			I could trace the access codes.
			If we could get to the root
			command... we could introduce an
			invasive programming sequence
			through its biochip system...
			and then return it to the hive.
			The Borg are so interconnected
			it would spread like a virus.
			Until it infected the entire
			Collective. We could disable
			their neural network in one
			stroke.
			Infected... it sounds like you're
			talking about a disease.
			Quite right, Doctor. And if all
			goes well, a terminal one.
			If this works the way I think it
			will, once the invasive program
			starts spreading, it'll only be
			a matter of months before the Borg
			suffer total systems failure.
			Comments.
			A question. What, exactly, is
			"total systems failure?"
			The Borg are extremely
			computer-dependent. A total
			systems failure will destroy
			them.
			I just think we should be plain
			about that. We're talking about
			annihilating an entire race...
			Which under most circumstances
			would be unconscionable. But as
			I see it, the Borg leave us little
			choice.
			I agree. We're at war.
			There's been no formal declaration
			of war...
			Not from our side. But certainly
			from theirs. They've attacked
			us in every encounter we've had.
			They have declared war on our way
			of life. We are to be
			assimilated.
			Even in war, there are rules.
			You don't kill civilians
			indiscriminately.
			There are no civilians among the
			Borg.
			Think of them as a single,
			collective being. Any one Borg
			is no more an individual than your
			arm or your leg.
			How convenient.
			Your point?
			When I look at my patient, I don't
			see a collective consciousness...
			I don't see a hive... I see a
			living, breathing boy... who's
			been hurt and who needs help.
			And we're talking about sending
			him back to his people as an
			instrument of destruction.
			It comes down to this: We are
			faced with an enemy that is
			determined to destroy us, and with
			whom we have no hope of
			negotiating peace. Unless that
			changes, we are justified in doing
			anything we can to survive.
			Security to Captain.
			Picard, here.
			The Borg has regained
			consciousness, sir.
			Acknowledged.
			We will proceed as planned.
			What's he doing?
			Trying to find an access terminal,
			so he can interface with the
			collective. He doesn't understand
			that the signal has been cut off.
			He's emitting a homing signal...
			and a second subspace frequency...
			but our damping field is blocking
			both signals.
			He's alone. For the first time
			in his life he's being forced to
			cope with his environment without
			the resources of the Collective.
			He must be hungry.
			The Borg don't ingest food --
			their implants can synthesize any
			organic molecules their biological
			tissues require. What they need
			-- is energy.
			Arrange to feed it.
			Aye, sir.
			I'll have to adapt a power conduit
			and install it in there.
			If I didn't know better... I'd
			think he was scared.
			I don't think I like this sport.
			Last week when you scored two
			touches on me, you liked it well
			enough.
			Today your foil was dipping too
			low... you kept letting me inside.
			And if I hold it too high, you
			lunge under it. Let's face it
			-- you're just better at this than
			I am.
			I hear we have a guest on board.
			Yes.
			Is that wise?
			I'm not sure. I hope so.
			I thought I understood you,
			Picard. But I don't understand
			this.
			It was an errand of mercy... he
			was injured, Doctor Crusher
			decided for humanitarian reasons
			to care for him --
			They'll be coming, you know that.
			You, of all people, know that.
			Shall we go again?
			You felt sorry for me. Look what
			it got you.
			I'll have to go in... to connect
			the power conduit.
			I will follow the Commander.
			Reactivate the field once we're
			through.
			Good, now just stay there.
			Commander...
			We are Borg.
			You will be assimilated.
			Resistance is futile.
			Take a look around, pal, you're
			not exactly in a position to make
			demands.
			We must return to the Collective.
			Who's "we?"
			We... are Borg.
			There's only one of you.
			Do you have a name?
			A means of identification?
			Third, of five.
			There were five on your ship...
			Is that it? Just a number?
			Third, of five.
			It does kind of suit you.
			This is for you. It regulates
			the power flow to the frequency
			you're used to...
			... and this connection should fit
			the coupling on your arm.
			You're welcome.
			Let's get out of here.
			Lower the force field.
			He's hungry all right.
			Why do you do this?
			I'm just a nice guy at heart.
			Feeling better?
			You are not-Borg.
			That's right. And hope to stay
			that way.
			You will be assimilated.
			Resistance is futile.
			That's gratitude for you.
			I've been rationing his portions
			of energy. I think he
			understands -- if he cooperates,
			he gets fed. If not...
			Like a rat in a cage.
			If I'm gonna figure out his
			command pathways, I have to learn
			how he processes information.
			The only way I know to do that
			is to give him perceptual tests.
			That means getting his
			cooperation.
			So he can participate in the
			destruction of his entire species.
			Doctor...
			I know, I know. We're at war.
			I'm here to help you... but I
			don't have to like it.
			I think we're ready to transport
			him. If he gives us any trouble,
			we can access the force field
			through this console.
			Ready?
			La Forge to transporter room three.
			We're ready here.
			We are standing by, Commander.
			Energize.
			You want some?
			Doctor Crusher, this is Third of
			Five. Third of Five, this is our
			ship's doctor.
			Hello.
			What is a doctor?
			A doctor heals the sick. Repairs
			the injured.
			The sick and injured are
			reabsorbed. Others take their
			place.
			That didn't happen to you. When
			we found you, you were dying.
			I saved your life.
			Why?
			That's my duty. To help those
			who are hurt.
			You give us food...
			Right.
			Is that your duty?
			Yeah. That's right.
			Listen, Third of Five... Doctor
			Crusher here has repaired a lot
			of the damage to your biochip
			implants. We want to run a few
			tests... see if everything is
			working okay.
			Tests...
			I'll show you some diagrams...
			ask you some questions about
			them... it's very simple, really.
			You will be assimilated...
			Right. But before that happens,
			could we maybe ask you a few
			questions?
			We will answer.
			Terrific. Okay, Third of Five,
			right over here...
			What is your designation?
			Designation?
			Third, of Five...
			You mean our names. We don't have
			designations -- we have names.
			I'm Beverly...
			This is Geordi.
			Do I have a -- name?
			Do you want one?
			A name...
			I'm Beverly, this is Geordi...
			... and you...
			You...
			You...
			That's it. Hugh. What do you
			think?
			You.
			Not you... Hugh.
			Hugh.
			All right... I'm Beverly...
			I'm Geordi...
			We are Hugh.
			Now imagine what this shape would
			look like if it were turned inside
			out.
			Which one is it?
			This one.
			That's right.
			He's gotten every one -- eight
			for eight. That blows the top
			right off the spatial acuity
			percentiles.
			It's the prosthetic eye... it
			seems to be giving him very
			complex visual information...
			Like some kind of holographic
			imaging system.
			That could be helpful.
			Hugh, I'd like to take a closer
			look at your eyepiece. Is that
			okay?
			Here.
			Well... thanks.
			When you are assimilated, you will
			have a similar device.
			Hugh, do you understand that we
			don't want to be assimilated?
			Why do you resist us?
			Because... we don't want to live
			the way you do.
			Here it is quiet. There are no
			other voices.
			Other voices?
			On a Borg ship we live with the
			thoughts of the others in our
			minds. Thousands of voices...
			with us always.
			I think what you're saying... is
			that you're lonely.
			Here you go.
			When you have completed these
			tests, what will be done with us?
			We'll send you home.
			We will rejoin the Collective.
			It's funny... when I first started
			out, I had no problem with
			creating this invasive program...
			but the more I work with Hugh,
			the more I --
			Hugh?
			That's the name we gave him.
			You named a Borg...
			Yeah.
			It was easier to have something
			to call him.
			Okay, so now you have a Borg named
			Hugh...
			And... he's not anything like I'd
			expected.
			How so?
			I don't know... he's... he just
			seems like a kid.. a long way from
			home...
			You're the second person today
			that's talked about this Borg as
			if he were a lost child...
			And now I'm having second thoughts
			about what we're doing.
			Programming him like a walking
			bomb... sending him back to
			destroy the others...
			This "kid's" big brothers are
			going to hunt us down. They won't
			rest until they have him back.
			And they'll destroy us in the
			process -- without any of this
			soul-searching you're going
			through.
			Maybe you should go talk to him.
			It might not seem so clear cut
			then.
			I wouldn't have anything to say.
			Then why don't you just listen?
			That's what you do best, isn't
			it?
			What is it, Number One?
			We've picked up a vessel on long
			range scanners, headed this way.
			Analysis.
			The vessel is traveling at warp
			seven-point-six. Mass:
			two-point-five million metric
			tons, configuration: ...cubical.
			The Borg...
			Its dimensions indicate that it
			is a scout ship similar to the
			one that crashed.
			Interference from the star's
			radiation will shield us from
			their sensors. We should remain
			undetected until they enter this
			system.
			How long do we have?
			At present speed they will arrive
			in thirty-one hours, seven
			minutes.
			Well... you don't look so tough.
			We are Borg.
			I hear they gave you a name.
			Yes. We are Hugh.
			Well? Aren't you going to tell
			me I have to be assimilated?
			You wish to be assimilated... ?
			No, I don't wish. But that's what
			you people do.
			Resistance is futile. Right?
			Resistance is futile...
			I've got news for you. It isn't.
			Some of my ancestors resisted the
			Borg, when you came to assimilate
			us. A few escaped.
			Resistance is not futile...
			No...
			But thanks to you, there aren't
			many of us. We're scattered
			around the galaxy... we have no
			home... we don't even have each
			other.
			What you are saying... is that
			you are lonely.
			What... ?
			You have no others. You have no
			home.
			We are also lonely.
			What is Geordi doing?
			Just studying the components in
			your prosthesis.
			Why?
			We're just trying to learn more
			about you.
			Why?
			You're very different from us.
			Part of what we do is to learn
			more about other species.
			We assimilate species. Then we
			know everything about them.
			Yeah. I know.
			Is that not easier?
			Maybe it is. It's just not what
			we do.
			Why?
			Think about it this way. Every
			time you talk about yourself, you
			use the word "we." We do this,
			we do that... you don't know how
			to think of yourself as a single
			individual. You don't say, "I
			want this," or "I am Hugh."
			We are all separate individuals.
			I am Geordi. I choose what I want
			to do with my life. I make
			decisions for myself. For people
			like me, losing that individuality
			-- is almost worse than dying.
			When you sleep... there are no
			voices in your mind.
			No.
			Are you ever...
			... lonely?
			Sometimes. But that's why we have
			friends.
			Friends...
			Sure. Someone you talk to...
			who can be with you when you're
			lonely... who makes you feel
			better.
			Like Geordi... and Hugh.
			That's it, Captain.
			It looks harmless enough.
			We had to disguise it as something
			innocuous. The Borg have ways
			of screening out programming
			anomalies.
			How can a geometric form
			disable a computer system?
			The shape is a paradox. It cannot
			exist in real space or time.
			When Hugh's imaging apparatus
			imprints it on his bio-chips,
			he'll try to analyze it.
			He will be unsuccessful, and will
			store the shape in his memory
			banks. It will be shunted to a
			subroutine for further analysis.
			When the Borg download his memory,
			they'll incorporate it into their
			network. Then they'll try to
			analyze it.
			It is designed so that each
			approach they take will spawn an
			anomalous solution. The anomalies
			are designed to interact with each
			other, linking together to form
			an endless and unsolvable puzzle.
			Quite original. How long before
			total systems failure?
			Not until the shape has gone
			through several hundred
			computational cycles.
			When can you begin the process?
			Another twenty hours. Doctor
			Crusher wants to make sure the
			new implants have taken hold.
			Very well. Proceed as soon as
			you're ready.
			Captain...
			I have to admit... I've been
			having second thoughts about this
			plan.
			For what reason?
			Well... I've been getting to know
			him. The Borg.
			I see.
			He's not what I thought he would
			be, sir. He has feelings... he's
			homesick...
			I don't know... it just seems
			wrong to use him like this.
			Centuries ago, when laboratory
			animals were used for research...
			scientists would occasionally
			become attached to the creatures.
			That was a problem if the
			experiment involved killing them.
			I would suggest you unattach
			yourself from the Borg, Mister
			La Forge.
			Aye, Captain.
			Come.
			Guinan... please, come in.
			You sure? Looks like you're all
			set for a quiet evening.
			I'm delighted to see you. Would
			you like something to drink?
			No, thanks.
			I was thinking about how you said
			my foil was dipping the other
			day... maybe I should do some
			exercises... build up a little
			strength in my arm...
			A strong forearm is always an
			advantage in fencing...
			Not to mention tending bar...
			About the Borg...
			Aren't you just a bit surprised
			by him?
			Surprised...
			Yes. Did you know he has a name?
			La Forge gave it to him. His
			name's Hugh. And he's lonely.
			I don't know what made me go see
			him. La Forge told me I should,
			but I said no.
			And then... I found myself
			standing there, staring at him.
			Curiosity, I figured... just
			curiosity.
			Picard... I want to hear you say
			that you're sure -- that what
			you're doing is right.
			If you've come here to persuade
			me not to use the invasive
			program...
			No -- I think I'm asking you to
			persuade me.
			Two days ago, you were so upset
			about the Borg even being on the
			ship that you tore the foil out
			of my hand. Now you're here
			questioning whether he should be
			treated as an enemy.
			I know. But... when you talk to
			him... face to face... can you
			honestly say you have no doubts?
			I haven't talked to him.
			Why not?
			I see no need --
			If you're going to use this person
			--
			It's a Borg, damn it, not a
			person --!
			If you're going to use this person
			to destroy his race, don't you
			think you should look him in the
			eye once before you do it?
			Besides... I'm not so sure he is
			Borg anymore.
			Because he's been given a name
			by a member of the crew doesn't
			mean he's no longer Borg. Because
			he's young doesn't mean he's
			innocent. He is what he is and
			in spite of the efforts to turn
			him into some kind of pet -- I
			will not alter our plans.
			Fine. But unless you talk to him
			-- at least once -- you might find
			that decision harder to live with
			than you realize.
			Worf to Captain Picard...
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			We are ready to transport.
			Proceed.
			You may wait outside, Lieutenant.
			Locutus...
			Yes. I am Locutus... of Borg.
			Why are you here?
			This is a primitive culture. I
			am here to facilitate its
			incorporation. Identify yourself.
			Hugh.
			Identify yourself.
			We are Hugh.
			This is not a Borg identification.
			Third... of five.
			This culture will be assimilated.
			They... do not wish it.
			Irrelevant.
			They will resist us.
			Resistance is futile.
			Resistance... is not futile.
			Some have escaped.
			They will be found. It is
			inevitable. All will be
			assimilated.
			Must... Geordi be assimilated?
			Yes.
			Geordi does not wish it.
			He would rather die than be
			assimilated.
			Then he will die.
			No. Geordi must not die.
			Geordi is... a friend.
			You will assist us in assimilating
			this vessel.
			You are Borg. You will assist
			us.
			I will not.
			What did you say?
			I will not assist you.
			"I"... ?
			Geordi must not be assimilated.
			But... you are Borg.
			No. I am -- Hugh.
			... I think I deliberately avoided
			speaking with the Borg because
			I didn't want anything to get in
			the way of our plan.
			But now something has. As far
			as I can tell, he seems to be a
			fully realized individual. He
			has even accepted me as Picard,
			Captain of this ship, and not as
			Locutus.
			Then... you've reconsidered the
			plan?
			Yes. If we used him in that
			manner, we'd be no better than
			the enemy we seek to destroy.
			I want other options.
			We could return him to the crash
			site... but we'd have to erase
			his memories of being on the
			Enterprise.
			But... if we erase his memories,
			then who he is, who he's become,
			would be destroyed.
			Isn't that the point? He'd be
			reassimilated into the hive
			without any questions...
			It just seems wrong... we help
			turn him into an individual...
			then we take that away from him...
			Is there a danger that the Borg
			might destroy him -- if they
			discover what's happened?
			I doubt it. They have nothing
			to gain by that. It's more likely
			they'll simply wipe out his memory
			of this experience.
			Then either way his memories will
			be erased.
			But perhaps...
			... in the short time before they
			purge those memories... the sense
			of individuality which he has
			gained here will be transmitted
			throughout the Collective.
			Every one of the Borg will have
			the opportunity to experience the
			feeling of... singularity.
			Perhaps that would be the most
			pernicious program of all... the
			knowledge of self, spread through
			the Borg Collective in that brief
			moment, might alter them forever.
			We will leave his memories intact.
			I have only one question.
			What if he doesn't want to go
			back?
			Hello, Hugh.
			Hello, Geordi.
			Hugh... a Borg rescue vessel is
			approaching. It will be here
			within three hours. We can return
			you to the crash site, where they
			will find you and take you home.
			Or... if you wish, you may remain
			here with us.
			What I wish... is irrelevant.
			It's not irrelevant. It matters
			to us.
			No Borg leaves the Collective.
			If they find I am missing -- they
			will come for me.
			Hugh, we'll deal with the
			repercussions later. What we must
			know is what you want.
			You are many. I am one. My needs
			are not important.
			Don't you understand? We're
			giving you a choice.
			Choice...
			Yeah. Do you want to go back with
			the Borg... or stay with us?
			I could stay with you... ?
			Yes. We would grant you asylum.
			Choose... what I want...
			I would choose to stay with
			Geordi.
			But it is too dangerous. They
			will follow.
			Return me to the crash site. It
			is the only way.
			Hugh... think about this... are
			you sure?
			Yes.
			The Borg ship will enter orbit of
			the moon within an hour. You'll
			soon be headed home.
			We'll beam him down and take
			position in the star's
			chromosphere. Its interference
			will hide us from their sensors.
			Goodbye, Hugh. I'm very glad I
			got to know you.
			Goodbye, Beverly.
			You saved my life.
			It's not too late to change your
			mind. You can stay here.
			I must return.
			Captain, I'd like to go down with
			him.
			My experience suggests that they
			would ignore him.
			Would you agree?
			The Borg assimilate civilizations.
			Not individuals.
			But, Captain, they kidnapped
			you...
			Because they needed a liaison to
			communicate with Humans. The
			Borg ignored every away team we
			sent to their ship, including
			yours, Doctor.
			You may accompany him.
			Goodbye.
			Captain... I do not want to forget
			that I am Hugh...
			Energize.
			We found you there... in the
			middle of that debris.
			Then that is where I will wait.
			We are now entering position.
			Radiation levels are rising.
			Increase power to the shields.
			Hold us here.
			Status of the Borg ship?
			Solar radiation is rendering our
			sensors inoperable. At last known
			course and speed, the Borg vessel
			will enter the system in three
			minutes.
			Well... I guess this is it.
			So long, Hugh.
