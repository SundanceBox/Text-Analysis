			Captain's log, stardate 45470.1.
			The Enterprise has been diverted
			to the Moab sector to track a
			stellar core fragment of a
			disintegrated neutron star. Our
			science teams have been asked to
			monitor the planetary disruptions
			it may cause.
			We've got a problem... our core
			fragment is going to pass by Moab
			Four in six days...
			Isn't that what we anticipated?
			We didn't anticipate that somebody
			would be living there.
			An artificial environment has been
			constructed on the southern
			continent, sir.
			Have you definitely established
			someone's inside it?
			Yes, Captain. Sensors are reading
			Human lifeforms.
			Human.
			Has there been a response to our
			hails, Mister Worf?
			Negative, Commander.
			Any starships ever reported
			missing in this sector, Data?
			Nossir.
			How the hell did they get
			themselves on a deserted planet?
			I'm pretty sure they know we're
			here...
			Mister La Forge?
			I'm picking up deep E-M
			readings... looks like wave
			emissions from an obsolete
			subspace relay...
			Which would suggest they also have
			the ability to communicate with
			us.
			Mister Worf, open the lower band
			frequencies that were most
			commonly used in the last
			century...
			Channel open.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			of the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. It is urgent that
			you respond.
			Sir, defensive shields around the
			structure are increasing strength.
			Not exactly a welcome mat.
			We mean you no harm. We must warn
			you that your planet is about to
			experience massive seismic
			disruptions due to an approaching
			stellar core fragment. No
			structure will be able to withstand
			them.
			They are responding.
			On screen.
			Enterprise... I am Aaron Conor...
			Mister Conor, we were unaware of
			any Human colony in this system.
			Captain, I don't want to be rude
			but we don't wish to interact with
			outsiders. I have only responded
			because of your warning.
			The fragment will begin to have
			serious effects on your planet
			in six days.
			Yes, I know. We have been
			tracking it. But our biosphere
			has been constructed to withstand
			quakes of eight-point-seven on
			the Richter Scale.
			Mister Data... ?
			The fragment has a density of one
			hundred billion kilograms per cubic
			centimeter. As a result, when it
			passes Moab Four, it will cause
			tectonic shifts well beyond
			eight-point-seven on the Richter
			Scale.
			I'm afraid we're going to have
			to evacuate your people.
			Evacuate? That's not possible.
			There must be an alternative...
			The alternative, sir, is dying...
			Mister Conor, if you wish, we will
			find you another isolated planet
			that is safe.
			No, we must remain here.
			Maybe we haven't made ourselves
			clear...
			Of course, you have, Commander...
			and I hope I've made myself clear
			that we must seek an alternative
			solution...
			We will gladly explore the
			possibility with you, Mister
			Conor... would you care to come
			aboard to discuss it?
			Our environment is sealed. No
			one can get in or out.
			We are capable of matter/energy
			transport...
			Matter/energy?
			We can take you directly through
			the structure.
			Really. That's quite remarkable.
			May we arrange for your transport?
			No. I must stay here.
			But under the circumstances, I
			will permit a small delegation
			from your ship inside the
			biosphere...
			... if only to see this
			matter/energy transportation you
			speak of...
			Very good. Commander Riker and
			an away team will join you
			shortly. Picard out.
			Limit the away team to three
			people, Will...
			Geordi -- I want to overwhelm him
			with evidence...
			Understood.
			Counselor, I'd like you with us
			on this one...
			This is a mistake.
			Good Lord, Martin, what would you
			have me do?
			Anything that would keep them out
			of here.
			We have nothing to hide.
			We have a great deal to lose.
			What is that... ?
			It's them... Look at this,
			Martin...
			Incredible.
			Hello.
			Forgive me... I'm not sure how
			to welcome you. You are the first
			visitors we've ever had...
			It's lovely... I can understand
			why you are reluctant to leave,
			Mister Conor...
			We are not just "reluctant", Ms.
			Troi. It is imperative that we
			remain.
			It would be suicide to evacuate.
			It would destroy everything we've
			worked for two centuries to
			accomplish...
			You see, this is an engineered
			society...
			Engineered... ?
			Genetically engineered...
			Our ancestors came from Earth to
			develop the perfect society. They
			believed that through controlled
			procreation, they could create
			people without flaws... and those
			people would build a paradise.
			All of you... have been
			selectively bred? Your DNA
			patterns chosen?
			Eight generations of us.
			We have immeasurably extended the
			potential of humanity --
			physically, psychologically --
			we have evolved beyond...
			beyond...
			Beyond us...
			Frankly, yes. No one in this
			society would be blind, for
			example, no offense intended...
			I can see you just fine, sir.
			Yes, well, my point was just...
			Thank you, Martin... Perhaps
			you've also made it clear that
			we still have a few imperfections
			we're working on...
			For the most part, we have
			achieved a fully integrated
			existence... not just among
			ourselves but with our
			environment... we don't just live
			here... we are part of the
			environment... it is part of us.
			Every plant life, every
			microscopic lifeform... is part
			of a master design.
			We cannot separate ourselves from
			it without irreparably altering
			who and what we are.
			Your presence here has already
			begun to affect the entire
			balance of our society...
			If we do not survive, the balance
			of our society won't mean a great
			deal... will it?
			I apologize. But he is performing
			his function as he is designed
			to do.
			What "function" would that be?
			He is the interpreter of our
			founders' intentions for this
			society.
			A judge.
			Yes, more or less. Obviously,
			he has no diplomatic talents.
			And obviously you do.
			I have been bred to fill this
			specific role... we grow up
			knowing exactly what our society
			needs from us... what we are
			expected to do.
			Kind of takes some of fun out of
			choosing, doesn't it?
			Not at all. My entire
			psychological makeup tells me that
			I was born to lead... I am exactly
			what I would choose to be.
			Think of it another way -- are
			there still people in your society
			who have not discovered who they
			really are or what they're meant
			to do with their lives... ? They
			may be in the wrong job... they
			may be writing bad poetry. Even
			worse, there may be great poets
			working as laborers, never to be
			discovered. That does not happen
			here.
			It is, for us, an ideal existence
			and we won't give it up easily.
			We will do whatever we can to help
			you preserve it.
			Hannah... I want you to meet our
			guests.
			Yes... from the starship... I've
			been looking forward to speaking
			with you...
			Hannah Bates is one of our
			scientists. She's an expert on
			biosphere homeostasis...
			It's a sensory organ replacement.
			It allows me to see.
			I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
			stare... I've just never seen
			anything like it.
			I'll be glad to show it to you
			if there's time...
			Yes, of course, the fragment...
			Hannah, Commander La Forge has
			brought all the studies of the
			stellar core fragment done aboard
			his ship...
			Wonderful...
			If there is any way to shore up
			our defenses, Hannah will find
			it...
			She has a remarkable talent in
			theoretical physics...
			I've worked up a few schematics
			based on gravimetric potentials
			and deflector energy allocation...
			Mister La Forge... Troi and I
			will return to the Enterprise...
			when you reach a conclusion, let
			us know...
			Yessir.
			Commander, if Mister Conor
			wouldn't object... I'd like to
			stay... and see more of his
			colony...
			No, no, that would be fine...
			I'd like you to see it...
			Riker to Enterprise. One to beam
			up.
			Acknowledged, Commander.
			Energize.
			You're sure my being here is not
			going to be disruptive... ?
			Disruptive... ? Oh, you mean, what
			Martin was saying...
			I certainly don't wish to throw
			off your entire "balance"...
			Too late. the damage is done.
			Seriously.
			Sometimes, I think the strict
			interpreters like Martin forget
			that we're still Human. We'll
			adjust, accommodate...
			There must be other unexpected
			events you have to deal with --
			an untimely death, an accident...
			Our geneticists are able to screen
			out any congenital health risks
			before conception... and the
			population is diverse enough
			to maintain a genetic balance
			in the event of accidental death.
			But very little that is unexpected
			occurs here...
			Am I making it sound incredibly
			dull?
			Not at all.
			I'll tell you the truth... and
			I'll deny it if you tell Martin...
			but today has been exhilarating...
			meeting you, meeting new people,
			with new ideas...
			I feel the same about being
			here... I'm something of a
			student of Human nature... I find
			this all fascinating...
			A student of Human nature?
			I'm the ship's counselor.
			Ah, I'm afraid there wouldn't
			be much work for you here,
			Counselor.
			I'd book my next vacation at your
			hotel if you had one.
			Well, in that case, I'll have to
			have them build one.
			... The planet's orbit is
			completely disrupted and the
			surface stability becomes almost
			nonexistent as the core fragment
			passes by...
			The biosphere's superstructure
			will never withstand the tectonic
			shocks. The environment would
			be compromised.
			That's how I see it.
			Your ship... what kind of energy
			output is it capable of
			generating?
			We have a matter/antimatter warp
			reaction system, the most powerful
			in Starfleet... normally kicks
			plasma up into the terawatt
			range... what are you thinking
			about?
			Well, either we're going to have
			to move... or that fragment is...
			We can move a small moon or an
			asteroid, but a stellar core
			fragment? That's way too massive
			for our tractor beam...
			What's that?
			A wild idea. Purely theoretical.
			A multiphase tractor beam?
			When we first spotted the fragment
			approaching, I came up with the
			idea... but we can't generate the
			kind of energy we would need...
			You can.
			Hannah would have to come with
			us to the Enterprise.
			No.
			With my theories and their
			equipment, we might be able to
			alter the fragment's path -- it's
			our only chance to avoid
			evacuation.
			No one had ever come here... and
			no one had ever left. Until
			today. This is a date to note
			in our history books.
			This is in direct violation of
			the intentions of our founders,
			Aaron...
			I don't think they intended us
			to die, Martin.
			Her absence will create an
			additional imbalance...
			Temporarily. The circumstances
			require us to be flexible.
			We have no idea how molecular
			transport will affect her DNA...
			It won't affect her DNA at all...
			There's been a century of evidence
			to prove that...
			You can go, Hannah.
			Enterprise, three to beam up.
			May I return later?
			I look forward to it.
			Energize.
			Captain's log, stardate 45472.8.
			Commander La Forge and Hannah
			Bates of the Genome Colony have
			spent nearly three days trying
			to find a way to adjust the path
			of the approaching core fragment.
			If they do not succeed in the next
			forty-eight hours, I see no
			alternative but to begin
			evacuation.
			I believe some will choose to risk
			death rather than leave,
			Captain...
			You've spent a good deal of time
			on the surface, Counselor. How
			do you suggest we change their
			minds... ?
			I'm not sure we can. It means
			abandoning their fundamental way
			of life.
			They've managed to turn a dubious
			scientific endeavor into dogma...
			You don't approve of genetic
			engineering.
			It was a bad idea whose time
			passed long ago.
			They seem to have made it succeed.
			They have given their humanity
			away to this genetic
			manipulation... many of the
			qualities they breed out -- the
			uncertainty, the self-discovery,
			the unknown - those are the very
			qualities that make Human life
			worth living... at least to me.
			I would not like to live with the
			knowledge that much of my future
			has been written, that my
			boundaries have been set. Would
			you?
			I've asked myself that question
			a lot during the past few days.
			I don't know. I doubt it.
			Nevertheless, this is what they
			believe in... and it won't be
			an easy matter to talk them into
			leaving...
			This leader of theirs, Conor, he
			seems like a reasonable man,
			doesn't he?
			I find him very reasonable. Open
			to suggestions, thoughtful, quite
			disarming... the perfect
			administrator...
			I'm sure.
			Will he leave when he sees there
			is no other choice?
			I don't know. I hope so.
			You admire him.
			Yes.
			Try at least to help him accept
			the reality of what may happen
			to his colony. If he makes the
			right decision, and he's as good
			a leader as he was "designed" to
			be... perhaps the others will
			follow him.
			If we increase warp power transfer
			by eighty percent...
			It's just gonna blow the emitters
			again.
			We won't be able to reinforce the
			conduit to hold that power
			level... it just doesn't work...
			I haven't slept in so long, my
			eyelids feel like they have lead
			weights attached...
			Geordi...
			Uh?
			Were you always blind?
			Ah, I'm sorry... I probably
			shocked the hell outta you, didn't
			I...
			No...
			Let me put it on...
			Don't.
			I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
			embarrass you.
			I've never been embarrassed by
			this, Hannah. Never. I was blind
			at birth. It's the way I've
			always been.
			May I see it... your VISOR?
			I guess if I had been conceived
			on your world, I wouldn't be here
			right now, would I?
			No.
			I'd've been terminated as a
			fertilized cell.
			It was the wish of our founders
			that no one have to suffer a life
			with disabilities...
			Who gave them the right to choose
			whether or not I should be here?
			Whether or not I might have
			something to contribute...
			I don't know what to say.
			How does it work?
			The VISOR scans the
			electromagnetic spectrum between
			one hertz and one hundred thousand
			terahertz, converts it all to
			usable frequencies and carries
			the information directly to the
			brain.
			But what about the data conversion
			rate? How do you avoid a
			sensory overload?
			A bank of preprocessors compresses
			the data stream into pulses
			so my visual cortex isn't...
			Wait a minute... wait a minute...
			we should be able to send a high-
			energy pulse through the tractor
			system... and if it's short
			enough, it shouldn't overload the
			emitters... the technology is
			right in here...
			If we could adapt those pulse-
			compression routines and apply
			them to the warp power conduits...
			We would have to avoid tractor
			force rebounding, but that
			shouldn't be hard...
			Sure. With some modifications...
			Oh, this would be perfect...
			What... ?
			If the answer to all this is in
			a VISOR created for a blind man...
			who never would have existed in
			your society. No offense
			intended.
			Please, Matthew. Continue.
			It's hard to believe... so much
			loveliness here... just a few
			meters away from such desolation.
			Hard to believe we're about to
			lose it...
			This must sound incredibly
			simplistic... but can't you
			re-"engineer" all this on another
			planet...
			A nursery rhyme my mother used
			to read to me has been running
			round and round my mind since this
			all began...
			A nursery rhyme?
			"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall...
			Humpty Dumpty had a great fall... "
			"All the King's horses and all
			the King's Men... Couldn't put
			Humpty together again."
			Why do we tell our children such
			ghastly stories?
			Perhaps to prepare them for times
			like these.
			We are every bit as fragile as
			an egg and as impossible to
			reconstruct... integrated and
			refined to such a degree that any
			fundamental change would lead
			to chaos...
			Nobody ever talks about how the
			King feels about being so...
			helpless...
			I'm so sorry, Aaron. I wish I
			could do something to help.
			But you have helped, you've been
			wonderful these past few days...
			you've been...
			... my Counselor.
			No. A Counselor has to maintain
			a discreet distance... I'd rather
			think of us as friends.
			Friends.
			No, that just won't do either...
			... will it.
			Aaron...
			I must confess a part of me knows
			that if I transport through these
			walls... you will be on the other
			side...
			Aaron, this is wrong...
			Terribly wrong.
			In order to move the core fragment
			to a safe trajectory, we needed
			our tractor beam to be able to
			handle high power pulses...
			And, we needed a much more
			efficient emitter to do that...
			About four times more efficient...
			But we couldn't get anywhere near
			that without overloading the
			emitter arrays...
			So we added a little VISOR
			technology to the process and were
			able to boost the effective
			force... and at the same time,
			lower the power conduit stress
			levels...
			What is the increase in
			efficiency?
			Up to almost three hundred
			percent...
			That's not enough...
			That's true... we won't be able
			to move the fragment as far as
			we'd like to, but...
			... But if we fortify the
			biosphere's structural
			integrity at the same time...
			With some of the shield
			improvements I've discovered
			here, it could work.
			We'll have to lend them some of
			our engineering support crews...
			Advise Mister Conor. Number One,
			brief the appropriate officers,
			prepare to transport them as soon
			as Conor approves...
			Yessir...
			You're up early.
			I'm still on Enterprise time.
			I'm going back to the ship, Aaron.
			I'm not going to see you again.
			Why... ?
			Because it's the right thing to
			do.
			I'm not convinced of that.
			You know it as well as I do.
			You're angry...
			Yes. I'm angry. With myself.
			For allowing this to happen.
			Deanna...
			I could fall in love with you,
			Aaron. So easily. But we both
			know the end of that story, don't
			we? How would Martin feel about
			introducing half-Betazoid DNA into
			the genetic balance?
			If we have to evacuate, anything
			is possible...
			Listen to yourself. A few days
			ago, you didn't even want to talk
			to us.
			This is my fault. I'm so sorry,
			Aaron.
			I need you here... this doesn't
			have to happen again...
			I have to go...
			Good news, Aaron. We should be
			able to change the course of the
			core fragment... but we'll also
			need to fortify the structure...
			and we're going to need help to
			do it...
			We'll have to bring down
			engineering crews from the
			Enterprise to work with your
			people for the next forty-eight
			hours...
			Engineering crews?
			We've got to install five new
			shield generators and power
			supplies...
			Fifty officers are waiting for
			your approval to transport down...
			We don't have much time, Aaron.
			Do we have any other choice?
			None.
			Enterprise, you may begin
			transporting when ready...
			Acknowledged.
			Captain's log, stardate 45474.6.
			Gravitational effects are being
			felt on Moab Four as fortification
			efforts continue. Meanwhile,
			the Enterprise has moved to a
			parallel course with the core
			fragment.
			We must adjust its trajectory by a
			minimum of one-point-two degrees
			to insure the colony's safety.
			Bring us within range of the
			fragment, Ensign...
			Aye, sir.
			You may proceed, Commander La
			Forge.
			Aye, sir.
			Good luck.
			You, too.
			Engage tractor beam.
			Okay, let's give it a try.
			Shutting down noncritical
			systems...
			Increasing impulse power to
			tractor emitters. E-P-S power
			levels rising...
			Emitter circuits one
			hundred-seventy percent over
			standard...
			Transferring warp power to tractor
			beam generator...
			Graviton generators operating
			normally... surge pulse now
			synchronized... emitters radiating
			at three hundred-twenty percent
			over standard...
			Bridge, we need more power...
			Reduce life support to minimum
			requirements, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			Three-hundred-ninety percent over
			standard...
			Come on... come on...
			No change in the fragment's
			course...
			We've gotta increase the pulse
			frequency...
			The emitter circuits won't hold
			for long...
			We won't need them for long...
			Four hundred percent over
			standard...
			All right. now we're getting
			there...
			The fragment's moved point-four
			degrees off its previous
			heading... point six-five... it's
			working...
			We have lost one of the emitter
			circuits...
			Life support failure... decks
			nine, twelve, and thirteen...
			Engage evacuation procedures for
			those decks. Geordi, I'm gonna
			need power back soon...
			Acknowledged.
			Fragment's new heading adjustment
			is at one-point-zero-one
			degrees... is it enough?
			Not yet... hold on...
			We have lost the second lateral
			emitter circuit...
			Losing life-support systems on
			decks five through nine.
			Evacuation procedures initiated.
			Mister La Forge...
			Hold on, Captain...
			Shipwide life-support failure in
			fifteen seconds...
			Almost there, Geordi. Course
			shift is at one-point-one-six
			degrees...
			Termination of all life-support
			in five seconds...
			Now, Mister La Forge...
			One-point-one-eight...
			Yessir.
			Shutting down all tractor
			emissions... transferring power
			back to life-support...
			One-point-two... we've got it...
			Life-support normal on all
			decks...
			Mister Data --
			The fragment's course has been
			altered, sir, by one-point-two-one
			degrees.
			Hail the colony.
			Yes, Captain.
			Success, Mister Conor. With the
			upgrades to your biosphere, the
			core fragment should no longer
			be a serious danger.
			I cannot adequately express my
			appreciation to your crew.
			Is Hannah able to hear me?
			Yes, yes, go ahead Aaron...
			This is an historic achievement,
			Hannah. You've done a wonderful
			thing for our people.
			Thank you.
			We look forward to honoring you
			appropriately when you return.
			Thank you again, Captain. Conor
			out.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			stellar core fragment has passed
			safely out of the Moab system.
			The colony was shaken by powerful
			temblors but fortunately there
			were no injuries and only minor
			damage was reported.
			Energize.
			That should do it... all members
			of the Enterprise crew are
			accounted for, Mister Conor...
			They've been invaluable,
			Commander... thank you again...
			If there's nothing else, we'll
			be on our way...
			Would you tell Deanna Troi for
			me... that I'm sorry I didn't have
			the opportunity to say good-bye
			personally...
			I'm sure she'll feel the same...
			A breach in the biosphere...
			Get Hannah Bates...
			Apparently, the refortification
			wasn't adequate. There's definite
			structural damage... it appears
			the tectonic shifts created a
			breach...
			Can it be repaired?
			I don't know.
			I'll have to run a diagnostic in
			the lab...
			Unless we can find a way to seal
			it... and fast... we'll have to
			evacuate.
			How long do we have, Hannah?
			Based on the level of toxicity
			I'm reading... it may be only a
			matter of hours.
			Isn't it amazing... after all we
			went through...
			Yeah, amazing...
			It looks bad... it's cracked well
			beneath the surface...
			Why are you doing this?
			What do you mean?
			There's no breach...
			What are you talking about...
			it's right here, look at it...
			I measured the toxic leak... you
			saw me...
			Hannah, my VISOR's positronic scan
			would have detected the leak...
			and its molecular pattern enhancer
			would have picked up even the
			smallest crack...
			The damned thing doesn't miss
			much, does it?
			Fine. I'll tell them the truth.
			Will that make you happy?
			Why are you doing this... ?
			I was born to be one of the best
			scientific minds of my generation.
			But in the past five days, I have
			encountered technology that I have
			barely imagined. I've got to
			ask myself... If we're so
			brilliant... how come we didn't
			invent any of these things?
			Maybe necessity really is the
			mother of invention. You don't
			always look for something until
			you need it.
			And all my needs are anticipated
			and planned for. Before I'm even
			born.
			All of us in this colony might
			as well have been living in the
			dark ages. It's like we're the
			victims of a two
			hundred-year-old joke. Until
			you came, we could only see to
			the wall of the biosphere.
			Suddenly our eyes have been opened
			to infinite possibilities.
			Now I'm supposed to come back to
			the farm and pretend I never saw
			Paris... ? Well, I can't.
			Asylum?
			She wants to leave the colony.
			She may not be the only one.
			The science teams working on the
			surface... fielded a lot of
			questions from colonists who were
			more than curious about what's
			outside their world...
			Why shouldn't we grant them
			asylum?
			We can't do that.
			We have to do that.
			Do you understand what it would
			do to the colony?
			I understand these are Human
			beings, Counselor. With free
			will. If she wants to leave, she
			has a right to.
			And what happens to the colony
			if she does? If others join her?
			The society is genetically
			integrated. Suddenly, there would
			be gaps, missing pieces...
			It would destroy them.
			There must be something we can
			do to help...
			I think, Doctor, that we may have
			"helped" these people too much
			already...
			We did save them from destruction.
			Did we?
			Counselor, I think it is time you
			took me to meet Mister Conor.
			Transporter room three.
			Computer, halt.
			Captain, I... have to tell you
			something... and it isn't easy
			for me... because I've used some
			very poor judgement... I've acted
			quite unprofessionally, actually...
			Counselor... what is it you always
			say... ? "Take a deep breath"...
			Conor and I have had a
			relationship.
			I see.
			It should never have happened.
			I knew there was concern about
			outside influences. I should have
			been more careful.
			Yes... I think we all should have
			been more careful. That's
			becoming more clear by the moment.
			What is your status with him
			presently?
			I did not intend to see him again.
			Would you prefer not to return
			to the surface?
			I think I should come with you.
			But I wanted you to know before
			we went down.
			I appreciate that.
			I wanted so much to help him, to
			be there for him... but the more
			I was...
			Deanna, every one of us went into
			this with the best intentions...
			I should have walked away as soon
			as I saw what was happening...
			And you didn't. And that's Human.
			We make mistakes.
			Genetic manipulation or not --
			nobody's perfect.
			You would ignore the welfare of
			the colony for your own selfish
			interests... ?
			The welfare of this colony would
			be best served by rejoining the
			Human race.
			She has been contaminated by the
			people on that ship...
			Aaron...
			Mister Conor, I believe you and
			I should talk.
			This is your doing. We should
			never have answered your hails.
			If we'd followed that advice,
			Martin, we'd all be dead now.
			So much for the welfare of this
			colony.
			You are not taking her with you.
			I'm leaving. And I'll tell you
			something else. There are at
			least a dozen more who are ready
			to go with me...
			Hannah... let's allow Aaron and
			Captain Picard to discuss this.
			Why don't we take a walk...
			There's nothing for them to
			discuss...
			Martin...
			I think it would be helpful if
			I...
			I want to talk with Captain Picard
			alone.
			But...
			Thank you, Martin.
			The irony is... he's the one who
			saw this coming. From the moment
			you arrived. And because I didn't
			want to hear it, I chose not to
			listen...
			You made decisions that you felt
			would save your colony.
			No... no, I wish it were that
			simple... but I cannot forgive
			myself so easily. You see,
			Captain, I know what Hannah Bates
			is feeling. For I have been
			feeling it as well. I found...
			your people to be... intriguing
			and stimulating... as she did.
			I was every bit as curious about
			you as the next man.
			But I am not the next man. I am
			the leader of these people. And
			every genetic fiber in my being
			demands that I protect them.
			Instead, I have betrayed them.
			I have allowed this to happen.
			We have both allowed this to
			happen, Conor.
			Then let us both find a way to
			stop it from going any further...
			I wish I could see a way.
			Picard, I was born to govern this
			colony, not to dismantle it.
			If you force them to stay, you
			will be suppressing their Human
			rights.
			If even a handful leave, the
			damage to this society will be
			devastating. What about the
			rights of those who would stay
			behind? They are the ones who
			inherit the social chaos that
			would follow for generations.
			Your arrival created this problem.
			Your departure solves it.
			That is simplistic.
			Refuse them passage.
			I cannot ignore the requests of
			people, Humans who ask for
			transport away from here...
			Nor can you ignore the fact that
			thousands will suffer if you agree
			to take them. And as suffering
			grows, more will demand to leave.
			We are witness to the end of this
			existence, Captain. I implore
			you -- do not let it happen.
			You would have me make the
			decision for you, Connor. But
			I cannot. I am willing to talk
			to these people with you. I will
			urge them not to make an impulsive
			choice. But if they finally
			choose to leave, the Enterprise
			cannot turn them away...
			Captain Picard has decided to
			grant transport to any individuals
			who wish to leave Genome Colony.
			I'm asking you to stay.
			Aaron... we can't be happy here
			any longer... we were innocent...
			it will never be that way again...
			The experiences of the past week
			will become part of our
			heritage... we will adjust...
			in a few generations, we will be
			able to...
			We're not willing to wait a few
			generations...
			All right. Give me six months...
			just wait six months before you
			leave...
			What will that accomplish?
			There is no question that our
			presence here has had an
			unintended influence on your
			society. That is done and there
			is no way to undo it now. But
			feelings are running high.
			Perhaps it's not such a bad idea
			to give yourselves adequate time
			to carefully weigh the
			consequences of what you are about
			to do. We are prepared to return
			in six months...
			In other words, we are being asked
			to stay here for six months while
			they pressure us to change our
			minds.
			In five days, you have seen only
			the most superficial evidence of
			what life is like outside your
			biosphere...
			Would you ever choose to live
			aboard a ship-in-a-bottle,
			Captain?
			What I would choose is not at
			issue...
			You are the captain of a starship.
			You live to explore the unknown. We
			ask for the same privilege.
			Hannah, this is your home, and
			we are all, in a sense, your
			family. Don't we deserve an
			opportunity to open a dialogue
			on this issue at the very least?
			I am only asking for six months.
			It's not going to make any
			difference. You will only be
			putting this colony through
			unnecessary pain and anguish.
			You are the ones who are causing
			pain and anguish in this colony.
			You.
			Don't you see, Aaron? It's over.
			It's time for you to lead our
			people into a new era, into a
			renaissance of discovery... come
			with us.
			When you're ready to come home,
			you will be welcome.
			You may proceed, Captain Picard.
			Enterprise, two to beam up.
			Aye, sir...
			Captain, may I have a moment...
			Make that one, Enterprise.
			Aye, sir.
			Energize.
			What will you do now?
			Attempt to assess the damage.
			Spend the rest of my life on the
			near-impossible task of rebuilding
			this society without the proper
			pieces.
			Aaron, you acted in the best
			interests of your people... there
			was no way to avoid what
			happened...
			I replay each step of this in my
			mind... looking for the wrong
			turn, the mistake in judgement...
			And I find only one...
			And as hard as I try, I cannot
			even regret that one. In fact,
			I'm certain that given the
			opportunity, I would choose to
			make the same mistake again.
			I have to wonder why, with all
			the hundreds of genetically
			compatible women here... I would
			fall in love with you.
			Don't say that, Aaron...
			Perhaps it is your imperfections
			that make you so unique. But I
			am in love with you, Deanna Troi,
			and I will always be...
			Come.
			The colonists are all on board,
			sir.
			How many finally?
			Twenty-three.
			If we ever needed a reminder of
			the importance of the Prime
			Directive, we have it now...
			They're Human. The Prime
			Directive doesn't apply.
			Doesn't it? Our very presence
			damaged, perhaps destroyed, a way
			of life.
			Whether or not we agree with that
			way of life... whether or not
			they are Human... is ultimately
			irrelevant, Number One. We are
			responsible.
			We had to respond to the threat
			from the core fragment... didn't
			we?
			Yes. Of course we did. And I wish
			I could see any other course we
			could have taken.
			But I would submit, in the end,
			we proved ourselves just as
			dangerous to that colony as any
			stellar fragment could ever be.
