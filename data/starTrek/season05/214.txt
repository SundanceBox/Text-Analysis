			Captain's log, stardate 45494.2.
			We are investigating a series of
			subspace signals that may indicate
			intelligent life in the Epsilon
			Silar System. We will be within
			sensor range in three hours...
			The characteristic response to
			the Kriskov Gambit is to counter
			with an el-Mitra Exchange --
			particularly since I have already
			taken both your rooks. By missing
			that opportunity, you have left
			your king vulnerable.
			We'll see...
			As you wish.
			Check.
			Intriguing. You have devised a
			completely unanticipated response
			to a classic attack.
			You will checkmate my king in
			seven moves.
			Chess isn't just a game of gambits
			and ploys -- it's also a game of
			intuition.
			You are a challenging opponent.
			Thanks. But don't think a
			compliment's going to get you out
			of our bet.
			You owe me one Samarian Sunset.
			Served in the traditional style.
			As only you can make it, Data...
			I will honor our agreement.
			Raise your arm out to the side.
			Is that it?
			I'm afraid so.
			You can put your arm down now.
			What do you think?
			I think it looks like you tucked
			when you should have flattened
			out.
			Something like that...
			Turn your head to the left.
			Some tearing in the ligaments --
			nothing we can't take care of.
			Good.
			If I remember correctly, the last
			time you graced my sickbay, you
			were diving off the "Cliffs of
			Heaven" on Cirrus Four. Holodeck
			program 47-C.
			Same thing. Only that time, I
			flattened out when I should have
			tucked.
			As your Doctor, I'd like to
			recommend the Emerald Wading Pool
			on Sumiko Three. It's a lot
			safer.
			Navigators on this ship have been
			doing flight handling assessments
			the same way for years, Ensign...
			And I've found a better way...
			Bridge.
			Do you mind if we discuss changes
			in procedure before you make them?
			If I had come to you in advance
			and asked you if I could do it
			my way...
			I would have said...
			"No".
			Or maybe "yes".
			The point is -- I never got that
			chance.
			The point is... with all due
			respect... you're trying to turn
			me into your idea of a model
			officer.
			Ensign... the rules on this ship
			don't change because Ro Laren
			decides they do.
			We are picking up a subspace
			signal, Captain. Sensors show
			a small space craft ahead.
			The configuration is unfamiliar
			-- nothing in our database comes
			close.
			Within visual range.
			On screen.
			Analysis, Mister Worf.
			No discernable armament. Reading
			one life-form aboard.
			Hail the vessel.
			No response, Captain.
			We're being scanned... but it's
			not like any sensor system I've
			ever seen... Should we raise
			shields?
			No. We'll start this off with
			a show of good faith.
			Sir, the scans are now matching
			the frequencies of our optical
			data network.
			It could be an attempt to access
			our computer system.
			Scanning intensity has increased
			by fifteen hundred percent.
			Shields up.
			One Samarian Sunset, served in
			the traditional style.
			It's beautiful.
			I hope you enjoy it.
			I hope you enjoy it.
			The scanning signal has penetrated
			our shields...
			Our computers are going down!
			Take evasive action --
			-- The helm's not responding!
			What happened?
			What the hell...
			I don't know who any of you are.
			Neither do I... I don't even
			remember who I am...
			It looks like we're all in the
			same boat.
			Make that -- "on the same
			starship."
			But who are we? What are we doing
			here?
			It looks like I'm the pilot.
			We're not going anywhere now.
			The helm's dead.
			But you still know how to work
			it.
			Yes...
			This console has a tactical
			configuration.
			Phaser power status, intruder
			scan, torpedo guidance...
			They do not appear to be operable.
			Clearly, we still possess certain
			skills -- we seem to know how to
			operate this vessel. But our
			identities have somehow been
			erased, or suppressed.
			We are on the bridge -- there's
			a good chance this is our ship.
			And it looks like you're the
			leader.
			We should not jump to conclusions.
			I am... decorated as well.
			Determining our command structure
			isn't crucial right now. Finding
			out who we are, and what we're
			doing out here is.
			But how did this happen? What
			did this to us?
			More like -- who did this to us?
			I've got some intermittent sensor
			readings here... the scan keeps
			repeating itself -- like it's
			stuck. But it looks like there's
			metallic debris right in front
			of us. Distance: seventeen
			kilometers.
			The remains of another ship?
			That's a good possibility.
			Perhaps we were engaged in battle.
			If they stunned us with some kind
			of bioelectric field -- that might
			have wiped out our memories.
			Then we fired back. Destroyed
			them.
			If this presumption is correct,
			we may have sustained other
			damage.
			Computer... status report.
			No voice interface...
			No interface, period.
			Hey -- got something.
			I've accessed the basic system
			directories.
			Can you give us a general status
			report?
			... Life-support systems are fully
			operational throughout the ship.
			Navigation and propulsion... Off
			line.
			What about communications?
			Completely disrupted.
			That rules out a distress signal.
			If we even knew where to send it.
			Do we have an onboard
			communication system?
			We do now.
			I suggest we use it. Our ship
			must have a crew. They may still
			have their memories.
			We should be careful what we
			say... there could be a boarding
			party somewhere on the ship.
			Bridge to all personnel. Select
			a representative from your group
			to contact the bridge and report
			on your status.
			Remain where you are. Stay calm.
			Bridge out.
			Well, that helps a lot.
			Report on our "status"? I wonder
			if every one else is in the same
			condition we are.
			It hurts...
			Thanks...
			I didn't even think -- I just knew
			how to use it.
			At least I've got an idea of what
			I'm doing here.
			What about me? I'm a patient in
			a bathing suit... That doesn't
			say much.
			No, it doesn't.
			Do you have any clothes around
			here I could borrow? At least
			until I figure out where the
			swimming pool is?
			Yes?
			We've heard from all decks --
			there are over a thousand people
			on board. Everyone's had their
			memories affected in the same way
			we have.
			I have completed a survey of our
			tactical systems. We are equipped
			with ten phaser banks, two
			hundred seventy five photon
			torpedoes, and a high capacity
			shield grid.
			We're a battleship.
			It appears so...
			This turbolift system will give
			us access to the rest of the
			ship...
			That sounds like the next logical
			step... we should start with the
			most crucial area first...
			Main engineering. Deck
			thirty-six. I'm on my way.
			Hey, hold on, we've gotta
			coordinate our efforts here...
			I just need to do something...
			Look, I feel the same way... we
			all do... but if anything's gonna
			get done here...
			I know, I just...
			It's really an ugly feeling...
			I don't like being so... out of
			control.
			Well, we're all gonna have to
			depend on each other to get
			through this, okay?
			Okay.
			We're going to search the ship.
			Very well. Proceed.
			I'll go with you. I want to get
			my hands on the computer core.
			See if we can reestablish control
			from there.
			I've accessed the optical data
			network for the engineering core.
			I can monitor every system that's
			routed through here.
			Warp and impulse drive are reading
			within tolerance levels. So are
			all the tactical arrays...
			defensive and offensive...
			Everything looks functional...
			now if we could just access the
			control systems we could get them
			up and running.
			According to the schematics, the
			engineering computer core access
			is down that corridor.
			Weapons, propulsion and shields
			are the priorities. We might be
			in danger of another attack.
			That's where I'll start.
			Let's begin our crew survey on
			decks five through ten.
			Alright.
			Good luck.
			You too.
			When you've got those systems
			going, try for the personnel
			files. It would be nice if we
			all had names...
			So far, our survey team has found
			no deaths or injuries among the
			crew. The shuttlecraft are
			operational, as are the
			transporters.
			But no one they've talked to knows
			any more about their identities
			than we do.
			Engineering is working on
			accessing the control systems.
			As soon as the ship is
			operational, we must make it
			combat-ready.
			I would recommend that before we
			prepare for combat, we try to
			access the ship's logs. Discover
			who we are and what our purpose
			here might be.
			I disagree. We must first make
			ourselves ready for battle. That
			is the highest priority.
			Engineering to the bridge.
			Go ahead, engineering.
			I've regained control of
			propulsion, navigation, weapons,
			and communications. We'll be able
			to tie them into the bridge in
			just a few minutes.
			Well done.
			We are ready.
			The question is -- for what?
			The phasers are operational.
			We now have full tactical control.
			We should run a complete
			diagnostic of all command systems.
			A full diagnostic would require
			us to take our systems off-line.
			We would be defenseless.
			If we're going to trust our lives
			to these systems, we should make
			certain they aren't going to fail.
			The computer was damaged. Some
			processors might still be down...
			Proceed with the diagnostic.
			What have you found, Doctor?
			Not much. The brain scans I've
			run are unusual, but they show
			no damage to the hippocampus.
			That suggests we still have our
			long-term memories... but somehow
			they're being blocked.
			Is it possible to bypass the
			normal pathways? To get at those
			memories in some other way?
			That's what I'm hoping. What I
			need now is to see some normal
			brain scans for comparison. Is
			there any chance I could get the
			crew's medical files?
			We are currently running a full
			diagnostic. Computer resources
			are limited.
			The medical records will be our
			next priority.
			Thank you.
			I guess these are my quarters.
			But I don't remember anything.
			If it's any comfort, everybody's
			in the same situation. Stay put
			for now... we'll be back in touch.
			Okay, sir. Thanks.
			That's all I need for now.
			Well, that's it for the living
			quarters on this deck. What's
			next?
			There's a large room up ahead.
			On the diagram, it's called "Ten
			Forward."
			Let's go.
			If everything was back the way
			it was supposed to be -- what do
			you think you'd be doing right
			now... ?
			Having a lot more fun than
			searching the ship, I'd imagine.
			Fun?
			With that holodeck we just saw,
			I bet I could conjure up an
			interesting program or two...
			Now, that's disappointing...
			Why?
			You don't strike me as a man who
			needs a holodeck to have a good
			time.
			Who reported to the bridge from
			this group?
			I did.
			Have you found anything that might
			give us some insight into what
			happened?
			Not specifically. But there are
			two things that seem unusual...
			The bartender is an
			artificial lifeform.
			Is there something I could get
			you? A beverage of your choice?
			No, thank you.
			I'm fine.
			Your memories are gone as well?
			The databanks that would identify
			who I am are not functioning.
			You were going to mention
			something else?
			I don't know if this means
			anything... but I seem to have
			an ability that the others don't.
			I have a very strong sense of what
			people are feeling... at times
			it's almost --
			Is something wrong?
			No... it's just... for a moment...
			you seemed familiar.
			You remember me?
			Not exactly... I mean, I don't
			know who you are... but there's
			something about you...
			Bridge to survey team.
			Survey team here.
			We have accessed the personnel
			files. Report to the bridge
			immediately.
			On our way.
			Computer -- give me a biographical
			listing of all personnel
			responsible for primary operation
			of the ship.
			A full biographical listing is
			not available.
			Is there any list of the ship's
			senior officers?
			The crew manifest is available.
			That's better than nothing. Give
			me the crew manifest.
			Commanding Officer, Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard.
			Executive Officer... Commander
			Keiran MacDuff.
			Second Officer... Commander
			William Riker.
			Operations Officer... Lieutenant
			Commander Data.
			Chief Medical Officer... Doctor
			Beverly Crusher.
			Ship's Counselor, Lieutenant
			Commander Deanna Troi.
			Chief Engineer... Lieutenant
			Commander Geordi La Forge.
			Security Chief... Lieutenant Worf.
			Helm Officer... Ensign Ro Laren.
			Commander MacDuff... Please see
			to it that all other officers who
			were listed report to the bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			Your next priority is to retrieve
			any information you can regarding
			this ship's mission.
			Contact the operations officer
			to assist you.
			He's in Ten-Forward -- waiting
			tables.
			I regret my recent behavior. I
			assumed an attitude of authority
			that was... unwarranted.
			We're all doing the best we can
			in a difficult situation. Think
			nothing more of it.
			Thank you... Captain.
			We haven't finished a full search
			of the computer records. But
			we've found out quite a bit.
			This vessel is named the
			Enterprise. We are part of an
			organization called the United
			Federation of Planets. The
			Federation is currently in a state
			of war.
			With whom?
			The Lysian Alliance. They're a
			genocidal race determined to
			destroy us. The war's been going
			on for years.
			Starfleet Command believes
			the Lysians have a new weapon that
			has shifted the balance of power
			in their favor.
			Over the last two months, fourteen
			Federation ships have been
			captured -- apparently very easily
			-- and the crews imprisoned on
			Lysia.
			What do we know about this weapon?
			Our scientists theorize that the
			Lysians are using an energy wave
			-- either plasma based or a
			subspace interference pattern.
			The weapon severly disrupts a
			starship's computer systems and
			the mental functioning of the
			crew.
			That's what happened to us...
			Commander, is there any record
			of our current mission?
			Yes, sir.
			We're approximately here...
			We've been ordered to cross into
			Lysian territory...
			... and destroy their Central
			Command.
			This is it -- the nerve-center
			of the Lysian military
			operation.
			Captain, there's been a great deal
			of damage to our computer system.
			Maybe we're not getting accurate
			information.
			What are you suggesting?
			That we get confirmation of this
			mission from our headquarters.
			If we use subspace radio we will
			be detected --
			But there may be thousands of
			lives at stake --
			Our orders specifically require
			us to maintain radio silence.
			Our mission is part of a highly
			coordinated effort to put an end
			to the war. There are other
			vessels on other fronts, all
			working according to an intricate
			plan.
			We're the lynch pin to the
			operation. If we don't destroy
			the Central Command -- the entire
			effort will fail.
			Captain, our choice is clear.
			Commander MacDuff -- set a course
			for the Lysian Central Command.
			These are your quarters.
			Thanks for the help.
			Come in for a minute.
			Recognize anything?
			It might as well belong to someone
			else.
			Nothing feels right... this room,
			the ship... most of all this war
			we're fighting...
			I don't imagine war ever feels
			right.
			I suppose that's true...
			What is it?
			That same feeling... you seem
			familiar... you're the only thing
			that does.
			Can you remember anything
			specific?
			I don't know...
			It's more like remembering an
			emotional image... feelings that
			are somehow associated with you...
			I hope they're good feelings...
			Yes... they are...
			This entire situation is... a
			little unnerving...
			It's been a long day. We've all
			been through a lot.
			Yes. We certainly have.
			I'll see you tomorrow. Good
			night.
			Hi.
			I know I didn't get the wrong
			room.
			I didn't like the way mine was
			decorated. Besides, I have a
			funny feeling maybe I spend most
			of my off hours here.
			Really?
			For all we know, you and I could
			be married.
			For all we know, you and I could
			hate each other.
			That's kind of exciting, isn't
			it? Because we just don't know.
			We might regret this.
			Regret what? Aren't you being
			a little presumptuous?
			Like I said -- I just didn't like
			the way my quarters were
			decorated.
			Maybe we should switch quarters.
			Maybe we should stay right here
			and see what happens.
			What if I snore in my sleep?
			What makes you think you're going
			to get any sleep?
			Captain, we have crossed the
			Lysian border.
			Ensign, take us out of warp.
			Three-quarters impulse.
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Worf, maintain a continuous
			sensor sweep.
			Aye, Captain.
			How long till we reach their
			central command?
			At our current speed,
			approximately thirty-seven hours.
			Captain, I am picking up a vessel
			directly ahead.
			Can you identify?
			The ship matches the Starfleet
			description of a Lysian Destroyer.
			A short-range attack vessel...
			with disruptor-style weapons, and
			a standard crew of fifty-three.
			Within visual range.
			On screen.
			The destroyer is increasing its
			speed.
			They are moving to intercept.
			Evasive maneuver sequence delta.
			Yes, Sir.
			They are matching our manuevers...
			Activating phaser arrays...
			Ready to fire, Sir.
			Stand by.
			Captain, our orders were to
			destroy all Lysian warships.
			I'm aware of that, Commander.
			Tactical analysis, Mister Data.
			The destroyer has minimal shields.
			Their disruptor capacity appears
			to be only two point one
			megajoules.
			They're no match for the
			Enterprise.
			Captain -- the destroyer is
			hailing us.
			Open a channel --
			--No!
			Their new weapon. Whatever it
			was that wiped out our computers
			and our memories. Maybe this is
			how they do it -- over
			communication channels.
			It is conceivable, sir.
			It's also possible that they
			simply want to talk to us. I
			think we should respond.
			They are hailing us again.
			If you're wrong, it could mean
			our destruction.
			I don't think we can take that
			risk.
			Captain, The Lysians have stopped
			transmitting. They are powering
			up their disruptors.
			They have locked onto us, sir...
			Full shields.
			Shields up.
			Captain... ?
			Return fire.
			The ship has been destroyed.
			Maintain our course, Ensign.
			Increase to three quarters
			impulse.
			Yes, Sir.
			Well done, Captain.
			The Lysian Central Command would
			have received any transmission
			from the destroyer by now.
			They're going to be on alert.
			I recommend a randomly vectored
			approach to our target. It would
			be our best chance of avoiding
			any pursuit.
			Agreed.
			Doctor, the success of this
			mission would be far more likely
			if we had our memories back. Is
			there anything you can do?
			I found several cases resembling
			our condition in the medical
			index. The causes are different,
			but the cure is similar in each
			case.
			Could the same treatment work for
			us?
			That's my hope. It involves
			increasing the activity of the
			medial temporal region of the
			brain. Using short term memory
			synapses to retrieve long term
			memory.
			When can you start?
			As soon as our medical records
			become available. It would be
			too dangerous to attempt treatment
			without them.
			Mister La Forge?
			Data and I ran into some trouble
			accessing the medical file areas
			in the computer. But with a
			little time, I'm pretty sure we
			can get there.
			Three hours, maximum.
			Proceed.
			I'm still hitting a file wall...
			I don't get it.
			There appears to be a command path
			discontinuity. I shall attempt
			to rewrite the locator subroutine.
			You must have been one hell of
			a bartender.
			It's too bad there aren't any more
			of you around. We could certainly
			use the help.
			Yes.
			I wonder why you're the only one
			on board?
			I have expended a great deal of
			thought with respect to my
			apparent uniqueness among the
			crew.
			Any conclusions?
			Several possibilities suggest
			themselves.
			I may represent an entire race
			of artificial lifeforms. If so,
			there may be a home planet for
			others of my kind -- a shared
			history and a culture of which
			I am not presently aware.
			Then again, you could've been
			built just for this ship.
			I have considered that possibility
			as well. It may also be the case
			that every starship in the
			Federation is equipped with an
			artificial lifeform such as myself.
			It that's true, you might all even
			look alike. A standard issue
			android. Hard to construct --
			so only one allowed per vessel.
			Maybe you all get together for
			android holidays...
			There is another possibility.
			Perhaps my origin was unique.
			In that case... I am alone.
			We have accessed the information
			storage area. But considerable
			damage has been done to the files
			themselves.
			The mission reports are gone.
			As are the crew records, and the
			personal logs.
			So are the medical records.
			Come in.
			I'm restless. Mind if I visit
			for a while?
			Please...
			What's wrong?
			Everything. Everytime I think
			about this war, our mission...
			I feel a sense of panic. Like
			a hand is closing around my
			throat.
			You're never gonna feel good about
			this war. None of us will. But
			we've got to finish our mission.
			I've been doing a little research.
			Learning about someone named
			William Riker.
			And what have you discovered?
			He's a musician, for one thing.
			Very impressive.
			Nobody could have been more
			surprised than me.
			What else has your research
			uncovered about William Riker?
			Let's see... He's athletically
			inclined... loves to mountain
			climb. He was born in a place
			called Alaska. He likes exotic
			foods... spends his vacation time
			on a planet called Risa...
			"Ode to Psyche." John Keats.
			Open it.
			"To Will... All My Love, Deanna."
			It could explain the familiar
			feeling you have...
			I... don't know what to think.
			Come in.
			Hello, Counselor.
			Ensign.
			I'm not interrupting anything?
			I was just visiting.
			We'll talk again soon, Commander.
			Of course. Thank you, Counselor.
			Bye...
			What was that all about?
			Just talking about the situation
			we're all in...
			Good...
			Because I have the feeling I used
			to be the jealous type.
			What bothers me, Captain, is how
			specific the damage is. Any
			records of a personal nature, any
			files that could tell us more
			about who we are -- those are the
			ones that are gone.
			That's a little too selective for
			coincidence.
			As selective as what was done to
			our own memories. Our skills
			still in place -- but personal
			knowledge unavailable.
			It's consistent with what we know
			about the new Lysian weapon.
			Doctor, is it absolutely necessary
			for you to see the medical files
			before you attempt a treatment?
			No. But it would be dangerous
			without them.
			I think that's a risk we have to
			take --
			-- Captain, I volunteer for the
			procedure.
			That's strange. The diencephalic
			activity is exactly the same.
			There should be some increase.
			Let's try broadening the band
			width.
			Go to thirty point one.
			Raise the frequency as well.
			Increase by thirty-three
			percent...
			Something's wrong with the
			sequencing program!
			Kieran. Kieran.
			I'm alright.
			What happened?
			I don't know. Something went
			wrong with the sequence initiator.
			We're lucky we didn't lose you.
			Did any of this work? Do you
			remember anything about yourself?
			I'm sorry, Doctor.
			It's back to square one.
			Enter.
			You wanted to see me, Captain?
			Yes, Commander. Sit down.
			I find myself with grave concerns
			about our mission.
			Concerns... as to its success?
			No. I have more fundamental
			doubts...
			Whether or not this mission is
			justified.
			I've been asking myself the same
			thing. But I'm sure our superiors
			feel their orders are justified.
			Orders which we cannot even
			verify.
			Orders we cannot ignore.
			But I also can't ignore the fact
			that we greatly outclassed the
			only enemy vessel we've
			encountered. And that every
			possible shred of information
			which could shed some light on
			our situation has been
			conveniently eliminated.
			I feel as though I've been handed
			a weapon, pushed into a room and
			told to shoot a stranger.
			I need a moral context to justify
			that action. And I don't have
			one. I'm not satisfied simply
			following orders. I want to know
			that what I am doing is right.
			So do I. I'd feel a lot better
			about this if all the questions
			were answered. And if you want
			to abandon our mission until our
			memories return -- it's your
			choice.
			But I must ask you... is it right
			to risk prolonging this war...
			to allow the needless deaths of
			thousands on both sides... solely
			on the basis of our moral
			discomfort?
			Captain, we are approaching the
			Lysian system.
			Decrease to one quarter impulse.
			Yes, sir.
			The Central Command is directly
			ahead. Still beyond weapon range.
			Red Alert. Battle stations.
			Bring us to attack posture, Mister
			Worf.
			Aye, Captain.
			Sensors show several objects in
			our path. They are twenty-nine
			meters in length and are unmanned.
			According to Starfleet records,
			they're sentry pods. Programmed
			to defend their Central Command.
			I'm reading forty-seven of them
			around the perimeter.
			Tactical analysis, Mister Data.
			The pods are equipped with fusion
			generated pulse lasers, and
			minimal shielding.
			Not much power there...
			Forward shields on maximum. Lock
			phasers on the sentry pods and
			prepare to return fire.
			Shields up, phasers locked on
			targets.
			Full impulse. Take us straight
			through them.
			We are through the perimeter.
			This is too easy.
			We have yet to encounter any
			battleships. They may lie ahead.
			Load all torpedo bays. Ready
			phasers.
			Aye, sir.
			Approaching the Central Command...
			Mister Data, scan for defenses.
			I am picking up no vessels -- and
			no additional sentry pods.
			The station is in visual range.
			On screen.
			Optimal firing range in fifty-five
			seconds.
			Phaser banks ready. Loading
			torpedoes.
			What are the defensive
			capabilities of the Central
			Command?
			Armaments consist of four laser
			cannons and thirty-nine cobalt
			fusion warheads with magnetic
			propulsion. Defensive shield
			output is only... four point
			three kilojoules.
			One photon torpedo ought to do
			it.
			Data... how many people are on
			that station?
			Fifteen thousand, three hundred
			eleven.
			Captain, we're in range.
			Stand by.
			Waiting for your order, sir.
			Captain, this isn't right...
			The rest of our forces are
			depending on us --
			How can our mortal enemy be over
			a hundred years behind us in
			weapons technology?
			Their battleships may be on the
			way right now.
			We must attack.
			I do not fire on defenseless
			people.
			Mister Worf... open a channel to
			the Lysians.
			Belay that order!
			There's something wrong with the
			Captain. I'm taking command of
			this vessel.
			Fire all weapons!
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are on a course to Starbase Three-
			zero-one. Doctor Crusher has been
			working steadily, and has restored
			the memories of most of the crew.
			The Lysians have identified
			"Commander MacDuff" as a Satarran
			-- an alien race that's been at
			war with the Lysians for decades.
			I've conveyed to the Lysians our
			deepest regrets over the tragedy of
			their lost ship and crew. They've
			been extraordinarily understanding.
			With all the power that MacDuff
			had... to alter our brain
			chemistry, and manipulate the
			computers... it's hard to believe
			he needed the Enterprise.
			Satarran weapons technology is
			no more advanced than the
			Lysians'. One photon torpedo
			would have ended their war.
			It almost did...
			I hope I'm not interrupting.
			Not at all. I was hoping to see
			you.
			Please -- sit down.
			Well. I'm glad I ran into the
			two of you...
			You know, when you have no memory
			of who you are, or who anybody
			else is...
			The Counselor tells me... at
			times like that, we might do things
			we've always wanted to do.
			She said that?
			It's psychologically valid.
			Don't worry about it, Commander.
			As far as I'm concerned we've
			shared something that you and I
			will treasure forever.
			I feel kind of... confused.
			If you still feel confused
			tomorrow -- you know where my
			office is.
