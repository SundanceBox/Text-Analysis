			Aft shields buckling!
			Transfer auxiliary power to

			Aft shields are gone!
			We cannot win. We must withdraw.
			Keep your place!

			GhoS!

			DaH! (Now!)
			Captain's log, stardate 45020.4.
			We have arrived at Starbase
			Two-thirty-four, where I have
			taken the opportunity to make a
			proposal to Fleet Admiral
			Shanthi.
			There have been three major
			engagements in the last two
			weeks... all of them won by ships
			loyal to the Duras family.
			None of which is our concern,
			Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war
			is, by definition, an internal
			matter of the Empire.
			Agreed. But if the Duras are
			being aided by the Romulans, then
			it becomes very much our concern.
			The Romulans have been trying to
			destroy the Federation/Klingon
			Alliance for over twenty years,
			and at the same time, the Duras
			have been secretly conspiring with
			the Romulans.
			Doesn't it strike you as odd that
			the Duras are able to field such
			an overpowering force against
			Gowron? That they outmatch him
			at almost every turn?
			Some would call it good
			leadership.
			And some would say they must be
			getting help.
			The Romulans have always been
			willing to take enormous risks
			in order to gain any advantage
			over the Federation.
			Can we seriously believe that now,
			with the future of the entire
			Klingon Empire hanging in the
			balance, they are content to
			simply stand by and watch?
			What is it you propose, Captain?
			We must stop the flow of supplies
			and equipment from the Romulans
			to the Duras family.
			I propose we take a fleet of ships
			to the Romulan/Klingon border.
			We'll take no offensive action,
			but we'll be in a position to
			expose any Romulan shipments that
			try to cross the border.
			A blockade...
			But how will you overcome the
			Romulan cloaking device?
			My chief engineer has developed
			a system that should help us
			nullify that advantage. Each ship
			will send out an active tachyon
			beam to the other ships in the
			blockade fleet. In theory, any
			cloaked vessel that tries to pass
			between our ships should cross
			one of those beams and be
			detected.
			I'll have to clear this with the
			Federation Council...
			In the meantime, assemble your
			fleet, Captain.
			Nicely done... I hope you know
			what you're doing.
			So do I, Number One.
			Captain's log, stardate 45021.3.
			Convincing Starfleet Command to
			establish a blockade was
			relatively painless.
			Implementing that plan is proving
			more troublesome.
			Starfleet is stretched pretty thin
			across the quadrant. There are
			only twelve ships within one day's
			travel of this position.
			The only other ships available
			are either in spacedock for
			repairs or still under
			construction. Most of them don't
			even have full crews yet.
			But we could probably pick up
			seven... maybe eight more ships.
			Mister La Forge, will we be able
			to implement your tachyon
			detection grid with twenty ships?
			It's possible...
			But the more ships, the bigger
			the net we can throw.
			I want to add the Tian Nan Men,
			the Hermes, and the Sutherland
			to join us whether the yard
			superintendent thinks they're
			ready or not. Mister Data, select
			a group of experienced officers
			from the Enterprise to augment
			the crews of those ships.
			Yes, sir.
			Will, I want you to command the
			Excalibur. Her crew was
			reassigned when she put in for
			repairs. Geordi, you'll serve
			as his first officer.
			I want the fleet to be underway
			by oh nine hundred tomorrow.
			Thank you, gentlemen.
			Yes, Data?
			May I ask a question of a...
			personal nature, sir?
			Yes.
			Why have I not been assigned to
			command a ship in the fleet?
			Well... I felt that you were
			needed here.
			Why do you ask?
			You have commented on the lack
			of senior officers available for
			this mission. I believe that my
			twenty-six years of Starfleet
			service qualify me for such a
			post.
			However, if you do not believe
			the time has arrived for an
			android to command a starship, then
			perhaps I should address myself
			to improving---
			Commander... I believe the
			starship Sutherland will need a
			captain. I can think of no one
			more suited to the task than you.
			Thank you, Captain.
			You always did have fools working
			for you, Larg... now you don't
			have as many!
			You were lucky, Kurn... but luck
			always runs out. Someday I will
			stand over your broken corpse and
			drink to the victory of the Duras!
			Ah, Worf... good.
			This piece of baktag is Captain
			Larg. He commanded the squadron
			that tried to destroy us
			yesterday.
			The infamous Worf, son of Mogh.
			What are you wearing? That's the
			uniform of a Klingon.
			The Capital City is neutral
			ground... and Larg's men are all
			around us.
			As are mine.
			Good to drink with you, Kurn.
			May you die well.
			Die well, Larg.
			You drink with our enemy...
			How many are Gowron's men... how
			many are Duras? Does it matter?
			When we meet in battle we'll fight
			to the death, but here... we're
			all warriors... all Klingons.
			The repairs on the Hegh'ta are
			proceeding. The port stabilizers
			are---
			Is there nothing in your heart
			but duty?
			It is my responsibility to oversee
			the repairs aboard ship.
			We all have responsibilities and
			duties...
			But we are warriors fighting in
			a great war! Think of it... you
			and I will fight battles others
			can only dream of... our time for
			glory is here. This is not the
			time to worry about stabilizers.
			It is a time to celebrate... for
			tomorrow we may die!
			Come... let the sons of Mogh live
			this night as if it were our last!
			Worf is not like his brother.
			No. He tries to be... but he is
			still unsure of himself.
			Perhaps he needs something to help
			restore his... confidence.
			I think he'll find our offer
			appealing.
			I'll make sure he does.
			You've got to keep that mixture
			above ninety percent or we'll
			never leave orbit.
			I am Lieutenant Commander Data.
			Lieutenant Commander Christopher
			Hobson.
			By order of Starfleet, I hereby
			take command of this vessel.
			Please note the time and date in
			the ship's log.
			Yes, sir.
			Computer, what is the status of
			the dilithium matrix?
			The audio pick up circuits
			aren't functioning. You can still
			access the computer manually.
			Excuse me... sir?
			I'd like to request a transfer.
			May I ask why?
			I don't believe I would be... a
			good first officer for you.
			Your service record to date
			suggests that you would perform
			that function competently.
			That's not what I mean.
			I don't think that I would be a
			good first officer for you.
			Why?
			Frankly, sir... I don't believe
			in your ability to command this
			ship.
			You're a fellow officer and I
			respect that... but no one would
			suggest that a Klingon would make
			a good ship's counselor or that
			a Berellian could be an
			engineer. They're just not suited
			for those positions.
			By the same token, I don't think
			that an android is a good choice
			to be captain.
			I understand your concerns.
			Request denied.
			The Endeavor has cleared the dock,
			Captain. All ships standing by.
			Good.
			Course one one eight mark three
			five seven, full impulse power
			Signal the fleet to get underway.
			We'll enter warp once we're clear
			of the system.
			Aye, sir.
			Engage.
			The Romulan convoy is late. We
			need those supplies.
			Gowron has suffered another loss
			near the Mempa system. His forces
			will not threaten you in that
			region for some time.
			But if Gowron tries to---
			The convoy will arrive in due
			course.
			A Federation fleet has just left
			Starbase Two-thirty-four... they've
			set course for Klingon territory.
			How many?
			At least twenty starships.
			Who's commanding this fleet?
			Picard.
			What does it mean? Is the
			Federation going to enter the war?
			Should we attack them before they
			get here?
			Silence the child, or send him
			away.
			Movar, I want you to return to
			Romulus immediately.
			Have all available ships
			rendezvous at these coordinates
			in two days.
			Yes, Commander.
			Twenty ships aren't enough to wage
			a war... Starfleet must be
			bluffing.
			Perhaps...
			Our forces in the Mempa sector
			are now in full retreat. They
			will have to regroup near Beta
			Lankal.
			We destroyed their supply bases
			in that sector three weeks ago!
			How can they continue to fight?
			They must be getting help.
			Maybe they have better leaders.
			I say you have failed as our
			leader, Gowron.
			There is no time for this! We
			must make plans before those
			forces reach Beta Lankal!
			How can we oppose the Duras when
			we continue to fight among
			ourselves?
			Gowron must answer a challenge
			to his authority.
			Stop this!
			Are we to fall upon each other
			like a pack of Ferengi? The enemy
			is the Duras! We are at war!
			Now the war can continue.
			We're crossing into Klingon
			territory, Captain.
			Signal the fleet to maintain
			yellow alert until further notice.
			Aye, sir.
			Begin long-range scans of the
			Romulan border.
			No uncloaked ships within sensor
			range... a few subspace anomalies,
			but nothing firm.
			Those anomalies could be cloaked
			ships.
			Could be, sir.
			Open a channel to the Excalibur.
			Excalibur, Riker here.
			Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time
			to spread our net.
			Yes, sir.
			We've arrived at the designated
			coordinates, Captain.
			All stop. Notify the flagship
			that we have assumed station.
			Starboard power coupling has
			overloaded. We've got a radiation
			leak on decks ten through twelve.
			Why are auxiliary back-ups not
			functioning?
			There wasn't enough time to test
			all the back-ups before leaving
			the yard.
			Terry, I want you down in
			engineering working on a new
			coupling.
			You have taken the phaser and
			torpedo control units off-line.
			Keith, you and I'll start bringing
			the coolant levels down in---
			Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate
			for you to determine a course of
			action without consulting the
			commanding officer.
			I was trying to safeguard the
			lives of people on those decks,
			but you're right.
			Belay those orders, everyone.
			The phasers and torpedos are back
			on-line. What should we do, sir?
			Take the phasers and torpedo units
			off-line and begin repairs on the
			starboard power coupling.
			Thank you, sir.
			You heard the Captain, everyone.
			We're ready, sir.
			Mister La Forge, how long do you
			think it will take the Romulans
			to detect the tachyon field once
			it's activated?
			Not long... Romulan sensors are
			as good as ours.
			Very well. Energize the network.
			Captain, the tachyon network is
			active.
			Acknowledged.
			Captain, the net has picked up
			five cloaked ships... they're
			stationary... about five thousand
			kilometers directly ahead.
			They've probably been sitting
			there watching us for some time
			now.
			There is an increase in tachyon
			emissions from the Federation
			ships.
			They're using the beams as a
			detection field...
			If we try to cross it, they'll
			see us... even if we're cloaked.
			Issue orders to begin work on a
			way to penetrate this field.
			In the meantime, we'll have to
			convince Captain Picard he should
			leave.
			New readings...
			Romulan ship decloaking!
			Shall I raise shields?
			Not yet.
			They're hailing us, sir.
			On screen.
			Tasha?
			No, Captain. I am Commander Sela.
			The woman you knew as Tasha Yar...
			was my mother.
			Deploying an invasion fleet along
			our border is a clear act of
			aggression, Captain. It will not
			be tolerated. You have twenty
			hours to recall your ships and
			return peacefully to Federation
			territory.
			Then you believe her, Counselor?
			I'm not saying we should accept
			her claim at face value... but
			I sensed no deception from her.
			She really believes that she is
			the daughter of Tasha Yar.
			Regardless of what she believes,
			Sela cannot be her daughter.
			I've reviewed all of Tasha's
			medical records, and there is no
			indication that she was ever
			pregnant.
			Besides, Tasha would have been a
			child when this woman was born.
			Sela could have been cloned.
			Or had her appearance surgically
			altered...
			But why? What possible advantage
			do the Romulans think they would
			gain?
			As it now stands, I don't see how
			this has any impact on our present
			strategy. We'll continue the
			blockade and leave the next move
			to them.
			Am I intruding?
			Not at all. Is something wrong?
			Word travels fast. I heard that
			Tasha Yar's daughter is on the
			Romulan ship.
			I think the Romulans have created
			what they hope will be a
			distraction... something to keep
			us off balance.
			Is that what you really think?
			Or is there some part of you...
			that wonders?
			Because part of me does...
			How much do you know about what
			happened to the last ship named
			Enterprise?
			The Enterprise C? It was lost...
			at the battle of Narendra Three...
			while defending a Klingon outpost
			from the Romulans.
			And... the survivors?
			There were stories... that there
			might have been prisoners, taken
			back to Romulus. But those were
			just rumors.
			There were survivors. And one
			of them was Tasha Yar.
			Guinan... that was twenty-three
			years ago... Tasha was still a
			child...
			I know. But I also know she was
			on that ship -- and she wasn't
			a child.
			And Picard... you sent her there.
			How could you know these things?
			I don't know how I know. I just
			do.
			I remember it.
			I can see her.. in my mind...
			asking me a question...
			And then it's gone...
			Tasha died... a year before you
			came to the Enterprise. You never
			met her.
			I know that... but I also know
			I'm right.
			If you have nothing more than a
			vague intuition...
			That's all I have. But I listen
			to it... and you should do the
			same.
			You can't just dismiss this. If
			I'm right... if you did send
			Tasha Yar on that ship... then,
			in a way, Picard... you're
			responsible for her daughter.
			I think... it's time I met
			Commander Sela.
			We are at war! Gowron should
			forbid any challenges until we
			are victorious.
			A Klingon does not... postpone
			a matter of honor.
			A Klingon should place the good
			of the Empire above his own pride!
			So now Gowron no longer suits
			you... perhaps you mean to
			challenge him for the leadership
			of the Council?
			No.
			Then do not speak of this again!
			I did not wish to follow Gowron...
			you came to me and insisted we
			support him against the Duras
			family. The time for debate is
			over!
			We are Klingons. He is our
			leader. If that is not enough
			for you, then perhaps you made
			the wrong choice when you put on
			that uniform.
			Well, Captain... what is this
			"urgent matter" we need to
			discuss?
			I'm afraid you misinterpret our
			presence here. I want to reassure
			you that we have no hostile
			intentions.
			Ah. Then I can report to my
			superiors that a fleet of
			twenty-three Federation starships
			is on our border for...
			humanitarian reasons?
			I doubt they are so gullible.
			It is most certainly our intent
			to prevent any external power from
			interfering in Klingon affairs.
			Nor do we have any plan to do so.
			But Captain... if for any reason
			we chose to enter Klingon
			territory... how would you stop
			us? With our cloaking devices
			we can slip by you at will.
			Then why not send your ships
			across?
			You sound eager for us to try...
			perhaps you've discovered a method
			of detecting our ships...
			However... I don't think you
			asked me here to discuss our
			military situation.
			All right. Why did I invite you?
			You want the answer to the only
			real question on your mind... how
			could Tasha Yar be my mother?
			It's been suggested that Tasha
			was aboard the Enterprise-C when
			it was destroyed twenty-four years
			ago. She was one of the
			survivors. You are obviously the
			product of a union between her
			and a Romulan.
			But... you know that's impossible.
			She would have been a child when
			that battle occurred...
			And yet you claim that it is
			possible -- that Tasha Yar was
			your mother.
			Yes... she was on that ship
			twenty-four years ago.
			She was sent there... by you...
			from the future.
			She was among those few who
			survived. They were all to have
			been executed after their
			interrogation. But a Romulan
			general saw her... and he
			became... enamored with her.
			So a bargain was struck: their
			lives would be spared if she
			became his consort.
			I was born a year later.
			I want to meet her.
			Who?
			Your mother. Is she still alive?
			One night... when I was four...
			she came to me, bundled me up and
			told me to stay quiet as we left
			the compound.
			I realized she was taking me
			away... away from my home, away
			from my father... so I cried out.
			My father had offered her life.
			He had given her a home, given
			her a daughter. How did she repay
			him? With betrayal.
			They executed her.
			Everything in me that was human...
			died with my mother that day.
			All that is left... is Romulan.
			Never doubt that.
			Doubts? I'm full of them.
			Nothing in my experience can assure
			me that what you say is true...
			but I do know one thing: it will
			not affect my judgment in our
			next encounter.
			You have fourteen hours, Captain.
			I suggest you use them wisely.
			Something wrong?
			Welcome, Worf... son of Mogh.
			What do you want?
			The same as you... personal
			honor... and glory for the
			Empire.
			Your family has never valued
			honor.
			You knew only our brother... we
			are not like him.
			Our brother made many mistakes...
			one was to make you an enemy.
			We would rather be your friends.
			Then you should not have opposed
			Gowron.
			Gowron is nothing.
			Toral is Duras' only son and he
			will be the next leader of the
			Council... in your heart, even
			you know that.
			But Captain Picard was right about
			one thing... Toral is not ready
			to rule the Empire.
			But we are... with your help.
			My help?
			Toral needs guidance...
			... a firm hand...
			... a father figure. That could
			be you.
			If you were mated to B'Etor.
			The rewards... could be greater
			than you can imagine.
			When the forces that follow you
			and your brother are united with
			ours... nothing will stand in
			our way.
			The Empire would be ours to rule
			together.
			Join us, Worf... and we will usher
			in a new era for our people.
			An era where honor has no
			meaning... where Klingons trade
			loyalties in dark rooms... and
			where the Empire is ruled... from
			Romulus.
			Enough, Lursa. You've failed.
			I need to know the strength and
			capabilities of the Federation
			fleet. I don't have time for
			this.
			Turn him over to the guard.
			B'Etor can have him back when
			they've finished with him.
			In thirteen hours we will be
			forced to either withdraw from
			the border or fight the Romulan
			fleet. Neither of those
			alternatives is acceptable. We
			must expose their involvement
			before the deadline.
			What is it you propose?
			If you launch a massive attack
			now, the Duras forces will need
			supplies... Lursa and B'Etor will
			call for help... the Romulans
			will try to run the blockade...
			and we'll be ready for them.
			And once the Romulan connection
			has been exposed... support will
			fall away from Lursa and B'Etor.
			Very well... I will make
			preparations.
			One thing more, Picard. Worf has
			been captured by the Duras. I
			hope he dies well. Qapla!
			When Gowron begins his attack,
			we'll make our move.
			The Excalibur will fall back
			with "engine problems." You will
			take the Hornet and the Akagi to
			this position... which will open
			a small gap in our detection net.
			And if the Romulans already know
			about the tachyon field, they
			should try to run the blockade
			at that point.
			Exactly.
			But when they try to send their
			ships through, the Enterprise and
			the Tian Nan Men will swing
			around, close the gap and catch
			them in the act.
			Very nice.
			I'd better get back.
			Good luck, Will.
			Good luck, Captain.
			We've just received an urgent
			message from Lursa and B'Etor.
			Gowron's forces have attacked in
			three sectors. The Duras are...
			nearing defeat...
			You mean they were caught
			unprepared and now they're crying
			for help.
			Have the science sections found
			a way to circumvent their
			detection grid yet?
			We think so.
			Just before we cross the border,
			we'll send out a massive tachyon
			pulse. A burst that large should
			cause enough interference to
			disable a part of the network.
			One of their ships is moving off
			the blockade line.
			It's warp drive is failing.
			Picard is redeploying the fleet
			to compensate for the missing
			ship...
			There's a gap opening in the net!
			He doesn't have enough ships to
			maintain the network...
			If we act quickly we can move
			through.
			Commander?
			No. I don't think so.
			But it's what we've been waiting
			for.
			Yes... I know... and so does
			Picard. He's giving us exactly
			what we need and he expects us to
			take it.
			No... we won't step into Picard's
			trap. We will disable part of
			his network...
			Here, where they're weakest...
			We'll direct the energy burst
			right at the ship with the android
			Captain.
			Sir, the detection net is picking
			up activity from the Romulans...
			fifteen cloaked ships... spreading
			out along the border.
			Signal the fleet to stand by.
			Now.
			Come to course zero eight zero
			mark two nine five!
			There's a disruption in the
			tachyon detectors!
			It's localized to this segment
			of the net...
			Open a channel to the Sutherland.
			Data here, sir.
			We're reading a disruption of the
			tachyon net in your area.
			Yes, sir. The Romulans have
			released a high-energy burst.
			The net is no longer effective
			in a radius of ten million
			kilometers around the Sutherland.
			Sir... I've lost track of three
			ships already... and the rest of
			the convoy is moving toward the
			disruption.
			That's where they're going
			through.
			Send a signal to the fleet... all
			ships to fall back and rendezvous
			at Gamma Eridon. We'll try to
			reestablish the net before they
			get there.
			Aye, sir.
			... all Federation ships proceed
			at maximum warp to Gamma Eridon.
			Acknowledge the signal.
			Lay in the course and engage at
			warp nine point three.
			Aye, sir.
			What are you doing?
			In disrupting the detection net,
			the Romulans may have caused a
			residual tachyon signature to form
			around their own ships.
			But we have no way of detecting
			it.
			All stop.
			Aye, sir. All stop.
			What? The fleet's been ordered
			to Gamma Eridon.
			The tachyon signatures will not
			last long. By the time the fleet
			is redeployed, it will be too
			late. Begin to reconfigure
			sensors to detect ionized particle
			traces.
			This entire area's been flooded
			with tachyon particles. We'll
			never be able to find what you're
			looking for.
			I am aware of the difficulties.
			Please bring the phasers back
			on-line.
			That will flood three decks with
			radiation!
			We will initiate radiation
			protocol when necessary.
			You don't give a damn about the
			people whose lives you're about
			to throw away. We're not just
			machines that you can---
			Mister Hobson!
			You will carry out my orders or
			I will relieve you of duty.
			Yes, sir.
			Sir... the Sutherland isn't
			heading for the rendezvous point.
			She's come to a full stop.
			Hail the Sutherland.
			The Enterprise wants to know the
			reason we've stopped.
			Display sensor schematic.
			Begin sensor sweep, maximum range.
			Are you going to answer the
			Enterprise?
			Computer, overlay display with
			tachyon emissions.
			Highlight any tachyon signatures
			which show subspace inertial
			displacement.
			Concentrate a sensor sweep in that
			area.
			Sir. This is pointless. Those
			readings could be anything.
			There's no way for us to prove
			the Romulans are out there.
			Reconfigure the photon torpedo
			warhead yields. Set for a high-
			energy burst at level six.
			At level six? But that won't
			even---
			Do it.
			Torpedoes ready.
			Another message coming in... it's
			Captain Picard!
			Mister Data, you were ordered to
			rendezvous with the fleet at
			Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge.
			Stand by, Captain.
			Mister Hobson, prepare to fire.
			Didn't you hear that? Picard
			wants us---
			Fire.
			They have discovered us!
			Reverse course. Order the fleet
			back to Romulan territory.
			Commander! The Duras need this
			convoy. Without these supplies,
			they cannot win!
			We've been exposed. It's over.
			But what should I tell Lursa and
			B'Etor?
			Tell them... they're on their own.
			They're changing course...
			heading back to Romulan space.
			The reconfigured particles from
			the photon torpedoes illuminated
			the tachyon signatures
			surrounding the Romulan ships...
			Make a full report to the
			flagship. Take the main phasers
			off-line and begin radiation
			clean-up on the affected decks.
			Yes, sir...
			...Captain.
			Defeat.
			How? Where are the Romulans?
			They never came.
			Kill him.
			No!!
			Toral... next Leader of the
			Empire.
			Gowron is looking forward to
			seeing you again.
			Captain's personal log,
			supplemental. It is with a
			profound sense of relief that I
			have ordered the fleet back to
			Federation territory following
			the news of Gowron's victory.
			We have arrived at the Klingon
			Home World, where I will present
			the High Council with a full
			report on our encounter with the
			Romulans.
			I am also... anxious to learn of
			Worf's fate.
			Come.
			Sir, I wish to submit myself for
			disciplinary action
			I disobeyed a direct order from
			a superior officer. Although
			there was a positive outcome as
			a result of my actions, I have
			learned that... the ends cannot
			justify the means.
			No, they can't.
			However... the excuse "I was only
			following orders" is the epitaph
			of too many tragedies in our
			history. Starfleet does not want
			officers who will blindly follow
			orders without analyzing the
			situation.
			Your actions were appropriate for
			the circumstance, and I have noted
			that in your record.
			Mister Data...
			Nicely done.
			Thank you, sir.
			The Council appreciates your
			report, Captain. The information
			on the Romulan supply ships will
			prove very useful.
			Before you leave, there is one
			last matter to attend to.
			Bring him!
			Toral, son of Duras... you stand
			convicted of treason.
			The Duras family will one day rule
			the Empire!
			Perhaps... but not today.
			Worf...
			This child's family wrongly took
			your name and your honor from
			you...
			In return, I give his life... to
			you.
			What's wrong? Kill him!
			No.
			This is our way... the Klingon
			way.
			I know... but it is not my way.
			This boy has done me no harm...
			and I will not kill him for the
			crimes of his family.
			Then it falls to Kurn.
			No. You gave his life to me...
			and I have spared it.
			As you wish.
			Permission to return to duty, sir?
			Granted.
