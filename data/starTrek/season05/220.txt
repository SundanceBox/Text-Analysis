			Forward tubes armed and ready,
			Captain.
			Fire.
			A direct hit, sir.
			The asteroid has shattered.
			However, the core is still intact
			-- and still on a direct collision
			course with Tessen Three.
			Is it big enough to be a threat?
			Yes, sir. It is of sufficient
			size and density to cause
			planetwide damage.
			Time to impact.
			It will reach the upper
			atmosphere in forty-four seconds
			and impact with the planet eleven
			seconds later.
			Ready torpedoes.
			Sir, the core is composed of
			densely compressed nitrium and
			chrondite. It is unlikely that
			another photon torpedo will have
			any effect on it.
			Mister Worf, prepare the tractor
			beam.
			Yes, Captain.
			Time to impact is thirty seconds.
			Sir, I cannot get a positive lock
			with the tractor beam. There is
			magnetic field interference
			emanating from the core materials.
			Suggestions?
			If we project a particle beam
			through the deflector dish, we
			may be able to produce a
			disruptive nuclear effect in the
			core.
			Make it so.
			The target has been destroyed,
			sir.
			The largest piece of remaining
			debris offers no threat to the
			planet.
			Well done. Ensign, put us back
			on course for the Moselina system.
			Warp four as soon as we've cleared
			the debris field.
			My instructions were clear!
			They were not!
			Before being allowed to play, he
			was to put his soiled clothing
			in the garment reprocessor.
			I was not!
			I sense a touch of hostility here,
			gentlemen.
			I specifically told you that!
			You told it to me yesterday; not
			today!
			If I may suggest...
			You know very well that the same
			rules apply today that...
			Please!
			Why not simply draw up a contract,
			which defines the duties of each
			family member?
			You mean he tells me what he wants
			and I have to do it.
			No, it means you both agree on
			your responsibilities. And when
			you've done the things you've
			agreed to do, then you've earned
			the privilege of doing things you
			want to do.
			When he's cleaned his room, for
			instance, then maybe he's earned
			a visit to the holodeck to fight
			his alien monsters.
			You suggest bribery?
			I suggest working out an equitable
			system where the rules are spelled
			out as clearly as possible. For
			the child and the parent. You
			must list your responsibilities,
			too.
			What would you like your father
			to promise?
			No yelling.
			I do not yell.
			Then you should have no trouble
			with that part.
			Well. Why don't you both go back
			to your quarters and talk it over?
			Decide on the points each of you
			wants in the contract...
			Very well.
			One day you'll be glad your father
			cared enough about you to insist
			on rules. It may seem hard to
			imagine right now... but
			eventually, most children come
			to appreciate their parents.
			Riker to Counselor Troi. Your
			mother's just come aboard.
			On the other hand...
			Deanna, my dear... it's mother!
			And I've got such deliciously
			exciting news, you're going to
			be absolutely thrilled! I'm
			getting married!
			You know, with just a bit of
			redecorating here and there, this
			Ten-Forward room should make a
			very nice wedding hall.
			I beg your pardon?
			My dear, where else? Among all
			my good friends... in the presence
			of my adored daughter...
			Mother, where did you... when did
			you meet this man? Who is he?
			I mean... marriage. When did all
			this happen?
			Ah, my poor plodding little
			Deanna, with her questions
			questions questions. Wherever
			did you inherit such pedestrian
			genes? What matters, my sweet,
			is that your mother's happy.
			Mother, if you're happy, then I'm
			happy for you. I only asked who
			this man is, and where you met
			him. Those are not unusual
			questions.
			He's a wonderful man, my dear;
			he has such good breeding, I tell
			you, he's absolute perfection.
			Who is he?
			He is Campio; third minister to
			the Conference Of Judges on the
			planet Kostolain. Royalty, my
			dear; naturally.
			Naturally. I didn't know you'd
			ever been to Kostolain. Or was
			he on some diplomatic mission to
			Betazed... ?
			Well, neither, actually. I
			haven't exactly met him yet,
			really. Oh, but the profiles
			we've exchanged. They're in such
			accord that you'd absolutely weep,
			my dear; you'd weep at the harmony
			between us.
			Mother. Don't you think you
			should at least meet the man
			you're going to marry before
			committing to spend the rest of
			your life with him?
			Deanna, I love you, but you do
			make everything sound like an
			epitaph.
			I don't want to agree!
			You have to agree. That's what
			an agreement is.
			Excuse the intrusion, Counselor,
			but we are having some difficulty
			drawing up our contract.
			Mrs. Troi.
			He isn't fair!
			The boy is unreasonable.
			Well of course he's unreasonable;
			he's a child.
			And such a child. Making little
			boys reasonable only gives them
			pimples.
			Alexander, this is my mother.
			Alexander! What a wonderful name.
			I once knew a tall, handsome
			warrior named Alexander who
			utterly adored me. We went
			everywhere; simply everywhere.
			Have you been anywhere yet?
			Contract? What contract?
			It's between father and son. A
			fair and balanced way of achieving
			a mutual sense of order.
			How ghastly for you.
			And you're doing this to your own
			child, Mister Woof?
			Mother!
			It is Worf, Madam.
			Contracts are usually for people
			who don't really trust each other.
			A child who is trusted becomes
			worthy of that trust.
			Mother, will you kindly stay out
			of this?
			If he doesn't perform his
			contractual duties, I assume he
			would be chastised?
			He would be... sanctioned, yes.
			But if you fail to perform your
			duties, what's the child supposed
			to do about it?
			Mother, will you please!
			I, not perform my duty?!
			Alexander. Life's true gift is
			the capacity to enjoy enjoyment.
			Now...
			... Have I arrived too late, or...
			... Can you still smile?
			Married? She's getting married?
			If we hold present course, we'll
			rendezvous with her intended groom
			in thirty-one hours.
			I will not continue to have this
			ship used by that woman for her
			convenience, simply because her
			daughter is one of my officers.
			Apparently, Deanna's being aboard
			was only part of the reason.
			The other part being?
			She seems to think that the honor
			of giving away the bride should
			belong to you.
			Permission for an on-board wedding
			is granted, Number One. Nothing
			would please me more than giving
			Mrs. Troi away.
			Ah! My little warrior. And how
			are you this morning?
			Oh, I see.
			Being punished for something, are
			we?
			It's just my regular time with
			Counselor Troi. She's not here
			yet.
			You came early. Well, that's very
			responsible of you.
			No, I just wanted to be out of
			my room before...
			Before what?
			Now if we're going to be real
			friends, we have to share only
			the truth.
			Why?
			Well for one thing, it's easier.
			When you tell the truth, you never
			have to remember later what you
			lied about.
			But mostly, a true friend is a
			person you can always tell the
			truth to without worrying about
			it.
			I wanted to leave before my father
			got back.
			Ah.
			I hate him. I wish my mother was
			here.
			But she died.
			And that's not very fair, is it?
			All he cares about are rules.
			I'm supposed to do everything
			right all the time.
			And I don't know how!
			Tell you the truth, little
			warrior, neither do I.
			But I do know one marvelous thing
			you can do with rules.
			I'm supposed to wait for Counselor
			Troi.
			Exactly.
			I'll bet you've never been to the
			colony of free spirits.
			What do they do there?
			Whatever they want. Artists,
			philosophers, free-thinkers...
			... people who don't quite fit
			other people's rules. Personally,
			I come for the mudbaths. You'll
			adore the mudbaths.
			Computer? I'm assuming you have
			the Parallax Colony of Shiralea
			VI?
			That program is available.
			Then run it for us, dear.
			What was that?
			A Wind Dancer... he stands guard.
			Only those whose hearts are
			joyous may enter.
			Fire sculptor. We'll chat with
			her later if you're not wearing
			anything flammable.
			A few of us were just gathering
			together for our laughing hour.
			Would you care to come laugh with
			us?
			Actually, we were about to
			experience a mudbath.
			Were you! What an idea! My
			friends and I will join you.
			One can always...
			... laugh in the bath.
			Do you ever drop one?
			No, no, no. They are my worlds,
			and I protect them. I am a master
			of worlds, and they fly only as
			I wish.
			We're having guests for laughing
			hour. Come join us!
			We'd love to!
			No, thank you.
			Yes.
			No.
			Why do you always say "no" when
			I say "yes"?
			I don't.
			You just did.
			There you go again. You are the
			most negative person!
			Why are they arguing like that?
			They're friends. They love
			contradiction... they thrive on
			challenge... they flourish in
			conflict...
			Then why are they friends?
			Who else can you fight with if
			not your friends?
			Hold! What is the lesson for
			today!?
			Damned if we know. We're just
			here for some fun and a mudbath.
			Every moment requires a purpose.
			No, it doesn't.
			Every purpose requires a plan.
			He does this every day; usually
			while everybody's food gets cold.
			Rather boring.
			The higher... the fewer!
			Well, that's a
			conversation-stopper if I ever
			heard one.
			Excuse me!
			If you're going to argue, you
			should remember...
			The higher, the fewer!
			So, my little warrior wants to
			see more in life than just
			fighting. Ah, the mind opens,
			and in creeps wisdom.
			Onward, to the laughing!
			Come.
			Isn't Alexander supposed to be
			with you?
			He didn't show up for his
			appointment, so I assumed he must
			still be here.
			Computer. What is the location
			of Alexander Rozhenko?
			Alexander Rozhenko is in holodeck
			two.
			Is he there alone?
			He is with Lwaxana Troi.
			To all the creatures within us!
			All the creatures within us?
			Of course. Every one of us has
			a thousand different kinds of tiny
			people inside us. Some of them
			want to get out and be wild; some
			want to be sad, or happy, or
			inventive or even go dancing.
			That's why we have different urges
			at different times.
			Are we ready for the
			entertainment?!
			Ready! Yes! Absolutely!
			And all those different little
			people inside us? We must never
			be afraid to take them with us
			wherever we go. Who knows when
			we might need one of them to pop
			up and rescue us from ourselves.
			Variety, my little Alex. The
			great secret is not the variety
			of life; but the variety of us!
			Mother, I'm trying to help this
			boy learn the value of
			responsibility. You're not
			helping by giving him a lot of
			mixed messages.
			I exposed you to all sorts of
			mixed messages at that age, and
			you still turned out deadly dull;
			what're you so worried about?
			Among other things, his
			relationship with his father.
			No more holodeck, Mother. Please.
			And why aren't you all absorbed
			in your wedding plans? It's only
			three days away.
			Oh, I'm letting Mister Homn take
			care of all the mundane details.
			He knows my tastes.
			Mother...
			There's really nothing to do, you
			nosey little girl. Campio's
			already sent me his mother's
			wedding gown, which Mister Homn
			is now altering for me. Outside
			of that...
			Wedding gown? Mother. Stop.
			Are you telling me you're not
			going to be naked at your own
			wedding?
			Campio is from a different planet
			with different traditions. He
			wouldn't approve of a traditional
			Betazoid wedding, so I'm adapting;
			simple as that.
			Care for some nice jestral tea,
			dear?
			I can't believe I'm hearing this
			from the Heir to the Holy Rings
			of Betazed; Holder of the Sacred
			Chalice of Rixx.
			Computer... jestral tea, please.
			I think it's time you tell me
			about this mysterious marriage
			to a man you've never met.
			Why shouldn't I get married if
			I choose to? You make it all into
			such a mystery. There is no
			mystery, Deanna.
			... except about this Petrokian
			sausage. All I wanted was a cup
			of tea. Dear, I think your
			replicator's having some sort of
			nervous collapse.
			A Level Four diagnostic of the
			food replication system has failed
			to detect any faults in the
			orientation terminals.
			That may be... but we've still
			got almost two hundred reports of
			replicators malfunctioning.
			There is an energy fluctuation
			in one of the utility access
			corridors.
			Well, we'd better look into
			whatever it is before the captain
			decides to order dinner.
			Dash four three; here we are.
			Some kind of intermittent E-M
			field pattern. Give me a hand
			here, will you, Data?
			No plasma leakage... just a little
			negative ion charging.
			Bad enough having to wear anything
			at my own wedding. But this.
			Maybe if we lower the bodice...
			... Raise the hemline, then.
			What a constant joy you are.
			My little warrior; come in, come
			in and give me a hug.
			You're not escaping another
			appointment, are you?
			No, Ma'am.
			No... I suppose eventually we all
			have to live up to our
			obligations...
			Now tell me; what brings you here
			to brighten my day?
			I wanted to say I'm sorry if I
			got you in trouble.
			That's very sweet, dear. But I
			really wasn't in any trouble...
			until I saw this dress. Come sit
			down.
			Ugly, isn't it?
			What's it for?
			I'm getting married.
			Why?
			Are you sure my daughter didn't
			send you?
			That's only a little joke.
			People get married because they
			want to spend their lives with
			someone.
			Their whole life? I guess you'd
			really have to like them a lot.
			If you're young... and lucky...
			it'll be someone you like a lot,
			yes.
			When you're older...
			Are you very old?
			I'm alone, Alex. And when you
			do get older... when you can no
			longer pick and choose from
			whatever may come your way...
			Well, then you do what we call
			"compromise". It keeps you from
			being afraid.
			We have traced the failure to
			a data net interface which routes
			replicator selections to the
			correct subprocessors.
			When we opened the panel, we found
			that the interface had been
			transformed... into a gelatinous
			material that we haven't been able
			to identify.
			We have intermittent failure of
			the inertial damping system.
			Take us out of warp, Ensign.
			Primary attitude control has
			failed; we've gone to secondary
			systems.
			We have lost helm control.
			The same thing that happened to
			the replicator happened to the
			stabilizer. The transfers in both
			systems were turned into...
			...this.
			Some kind of corrosion?
			We have not yet identified the
			substance, Commander.
			Whatever it is, it looks like
			there's been a conversion process
			-- transforming some of the metal
			into gelatinous residue. But what
			caused it is a mystery.
			The stabilizers and the
			replicators. Two totally
			unrelated systems...
			Yessir, and we still don't know
			why the sensors didn't catch the
			problems.
			Why don't you run a mass
			spectrometer analysis -- find out
			just what this stuff is.
			Transporter room one to Captain
			Picard. Minister Campio is
			beaming on board, sir.
			I'll be right there.
			The bridegroom.
			Ah! Campio!
			My dear, your compatibility
			profile didn't do you justice. I,
			of course, am Lwaxana, and any
			introductory compliments you'd
			care to make will be happily
			received.
			Indeed, Mrs. Troi... you are even
			lovelier in person.
			That one sounded just fine.
			Now, now... we don't wish to be
			too familiar at this early
			juncture.
			Please excuse my tardiness; ship's
			duties. Minister Campio? I'm
			Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of the
			Enterprise. Welcome aboard, sir.
			I thank you, Captain, and greet
			you with appreciation for
			permitting this wedding aboard
			your fine vessel.
			Not at all, sir.
			Campio, may I present my daughter?
			Deanna Troi, meet, uh... well,
			your future stepfather, come to
			think of it.
			Ah, yes.
			If I recall the profile, you are
			the ship's counselor.
			I am, sir.
			And my escort, who need not be
			addressed in this company:
			Protocol Master, Erko.
			Protocol master?
			He is nonetheless welcome.
			Campio, dear, personally I adore
			every ounce of ostentation I can
			get, but... a protocol master?
			I would not do you nor our
			benevolent hosts the disservice
			of failing to ensure that
			priorities are observed.
			Oh, well that's... very
			thoughtful.
			After all, it would be
			unpardonable to simply abandon
			ourselves to the moment, would
			it not?
			Unpardonable.
			Of course, it was my thinking that
			we might just get acquainted a
			bit. I could show you around and
			we could... develop a feel for each
			other, so to speak.
			Jean-Luc?
			Of course. The ship is yours.
			How very thoughtful of you. But
			I must remain in the company of
			Master Erko until the wedding
			ceremony itself.
			You're joking.
			Is there some objection?
			No, of course not. But please
			try to bear with me until I have
			a little better grasp of your
			rules, and...
			...protocols.
			Certainly. Our culture is so
			totally new to you. I assure you
			of my utmost patience. And any
			tutoring you may desire about our
			customs, in addition to those
			regarding the wedding
			procedures...
			Captain Picard to the bridge,
			please.
			On my way.
			Excuse me.
			Counselor, I'll trust you to keep
			everything running smoothly.
			Thank you, Captain.
			It looks like the only alloy
			common to the stabilizer and the
			replicator is nitrium.
			Computer, analyze the nitrium
			content of the affected stabilizer
			and replicator.
			There is no nitrium present in
			the affected stabilizer or
			replicator.
			There is none present in the
			residue, either.
			According to the mass spectrometer,
			the elements in the residue have
			been broken down into simpler
			molecular structures...
			That would suggest the nitrium
			has been organically metabolized.
			Maybe that's it, Data... if a
			living organism ingested the
			nitrium...
			This residue could be the waste
			left behind.
			If that's true, if something's
			eating away at the nitrium on the
			ship...
			That means the dilithium chamber
			is vulnerable... and the power
			transfer conduits. We'd better
			get down to engineering.
			Ha!
			Eat well, son.
			Ha!
			What are you doing? What is that
			noise?
			Ha! It's my laughing hour. Ha!
			Ha!
			That is enough, please. It is
			your eating hour. Eat.
			Ha! I promised to meet Mrs. Troi
			for another lesson in happy
			wisdom. Ha!
			Will you stop doing that, please.
			Alexander, eat your food. Wisdom
			will wait, I assure you.
			But I promised. Ha! Should I
			break my promise, Father?
			No Klingon ever breaks his word.
			Where are you going?
			You said no Klingon breaks his
			word.
			I did not mean now. Now you will
			sit down and eat.
			I don't understand. You're
			confusing me.
			Understand later. Now, just eat!
			Father... ? The higher, the fewer.
			I do not understand. I have been
			very clear with the boy as to his
			obligations. And yet -- he
			continues to ignore me.
			I know what you mean. I've been
			quite clear with my mother about
			her not interfering with
			Alexander... but she does what
			she wants in spite of it.
			When I was six years old, I
			listened to what my parents said.
			I obeyed their rules.
			Most of the time.
			When I was six, she gave me a
			birthday party. Halfway through
			it, she disappeared... and finally
			came back dressed as a Koropian
			princess... carried in a sedan
			chair by four young men. It was
			mortifying.
			My mother would not have done
			that.
			It seems that all my life I've
			felt like I'm the parent... and
			my mother is the child...
			I wonder why I'm at such a loss
			to put a stop to it?
			And I wonder why I have lost
			control of Alexander.
			You know... it's been said that
			grandparents and grandchildren
			get along so well because they
			have a common enemy.
			I don't wish to be authoritative,
			my dear, but Master Erko says that
			now is our proper time for
			discussion of certain details.
			Well, I certainly don't wish to
			be considered anti-Erko, dear,
			but I did promise Alexander one
			more holodeck trip.
			So come, my little love.
			Surely there'll be other occasions
			for you to spend time with the
			boy.
			My goodness, Campio. You and I
			are going to have the rest of our
			lives. Tell you what: I'll be
			back with you in one hour.
			Exactly. All right?
			Minister, the woman should not
			be addressing you in the familiar.
			Mother, we need to talk...
			We certainly do, dear, but not
			just now.
			How do I address him?
			Mother, we've come for Alexander.
			Please forgive the intrusion,
			but...
			Preferably, he should be called
			by his ministerial title.
			Ah. I'll remember. Mister Homn?
			You make everybody comfortable
			until we get back; especially...
			... the Minister.
			One hour, darling; see you then.
			Mrs. Troi, it is Alexander's
			dinner hour.
			How thoughtless of me.
			We'll have a little picnic before
			the mudbath.
			But we have business to deal with
			here. Leaving is simply not
			acceptable.
			Oh, can't we pretend it's
			acceptable? We'll be back.
			You are missing the point.
			Alexander, you will please return
			to quarters and have your dinner.
			But we're going to the holodeck.
			Mother, you are undermining every
			effort we're trying to make
			here.
			Don't be absurd.
			It is essential that the wedding
			procedures be discussed now.
			Well, then... Minister, darling,
			perhaps you and the Gerko there
			can come with us.
			Poor dear, don't they ever let
			you change those colorless
			outfits?
			Lwaxana, this exceeds all
			boundaries.
			Oh. Well, half an hour, then.
			No longer. I promise. Your
			duties, Mister Homn.
			Counselor Troi, have you no
			influence?
			Hah!
			Ha!
			Lwaxana, if you will remain, I
			may allow the boy to stay while
			we...
			Definitely not.
			Definitely not. My son is to
			return to quarters!
			Nor may a servant be present
			during a prenuptial consultation.
			Well, sir, I'm afraid even the
			bride won't be present for this
			one.
			The dilithium chamber shows no
			anomalous readings.
			So far, these transfer conduits
			are clean, too -- hold on, I'm
			getting something here...
			There's a pretty severe energy
			fluctuation in this access
			panel...
			What happened?
			I was just juggling... and I
			happened to catch one in my mouth.
			It tasted good, so I ate it. Then
			before I knew it, I'd eaten every
			one of my worlds. It hadn't
			occurred to me that, once they
			were gone, I'd have nothing left
			to juggle. If you ever have a
			world, plan ahead. Don't eat it.
			Well, now. Almost time to go
			back.
			Are you sad?
			Why, of course not. I'm about to
			be a bride.
			That man you're going to marry?
			He wouldn't ever come for a
			mudbath, would he?
			Oh, he might... Probably not.
			Maybe this would be a good time
			to get one of those little
			people that live inside you to
			come out and tell you what to do;
			or help you, or something.
			Alexander, what are you talking
			about?
			I'm sorry.
			No... Don't you dare be sorry.
			Something's wrong.
			Come, dear, let's not leave
			everyone waiting for us.
			When we saw that photonic
			trail moving through the walls,
			we realized we must be dealing
			with a metal parasite of some
			kind.
			We believe the parasites came
			through the ship's hull when we
			destroyed the asteroid near Tessen
			Three.
			Are they attacking anything other
			than nitrium alloy?
			Not that we can tell. But we've
			got nitrium everywhere --
			ventilation, life support,
			engines, computers... even in the
			dilithium chamber.
			Mister Data... you said the
			asteroid we destroyed was rich
			in nitrium...
			Yes, sir.
			That asteroid was from the
			Pelloris Field... if the rest of
			that field is rich in nitrium...
			it would have been a natural
			feeding ground.
			We should think about going back
			there... it's possible the
			parasites could be lured back to
			the asteroids... for a meal
			that's more appealing than we
			are.
			How long to the field, Mister
			Data?
			At warp nine, five hours twenty
			minutes, sir.
			Picard to the bridge...
			Riker here, sir.
			Set a course for the Pelloris
			asteroid field -- warp nine.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, with our sensors unable
			to detect the parasites... and
			given the speed with which they
			appear to be moving through the
			ship --
			-- then we may not have five hours
			and twenty minutes. I'm aware
			of that. What can we do to slow
			them down?
			In several cases, an exanogen gas
			barrier has been known to slow
			the progress of metal parasites.
			They don't like the cold, eh?
			Make it so.
			The problem is finding them. By
			the time we spot an energy
			fluctuation, they've consumed all
			the nitrium and moved on.
			Primary power systems are going
			down. I'll reroute to the
			secondary generators.
			Advise the bridge.
			Mister Data, with me.
			Bridge.
			Commander, do you have any
			suggestions on how we could
			encourage the parasites to leave
			the ship once we reach the
			Pelloris Field?
			If we reconfigure a particle beam
			with a high concentration of
			nitrium, and project it
			toward one of the asteroids...
			They'll follow the beam... like
			a trail of breadcrumbs. Very
			well --
			Turbolift velocity is beginning
			to fluctuate, Captain.
			Computer; stop at next level.
			Computer, acknowledge.
			We have reached the bridge, sir.
			Report, Number One.
			Life support and ventilation are
			failing at random spots all over
			the ship.
			Captain, we've dropped to warp
			five-point-seven.
			Picard to engineering.
			La Forge here...
			What's happening, Mister La Forge?
			We're slowing down.
			The parasites must've gotten into
			the primary warp controller, sir.
			I'm trying to do a bypass patch
			to isolate the backup
			controllers... but it looks like
			warp six is the best I can give
			you.
			At that speed there won't be a
			ship left to reach the Pelloris
			Field. Do what you have to.
			Working on it, sir.
			Captain, we're losing life support
			on decks eleven and twelve.
			Mister Worf, have security
			evacuate all personnel from those
			decks.
			They're just moving us to another
			deck. Don't you worry, my little
			warrior; we'll be fine.
			Engineering to bridge. We've got
			warp six-point-five... but I
			don't know how much more coaxing
			I can do here.
			We need more speed than that,
			Commander.
			The matter-antimatter injectors
			are failing... I'm rerouting to
			secondary injector power now.
			Watch the antimatter containment
			for any system failure!
			Atmospheric systems are down to
			twenty-seven percent. We're going
			below tolerable oxygen limits.
			We must evacuate decks twenty
			through twenty-four, Captain.
			Make it so... and shut down all
			life support to those decks.
			Direct all evacuees to decks nine
			and ten.
			Divert emergency life support to
			those decks.
			Yes, Captain.
			Time to the asteroid field?
			If we maintain current speed --
			and there is no guarantee that
			we will -- two hours, twenty-three
			minutes.
			Mister Data. The rest of us may
			lose consciousness. If we do,
			it will be your job to execute
			the plan as discussed.
			Aye, Captain.
			Structural integrity of the
			dilithium chamber is at
			thirty-four percent. Estimated
			breach in one minute.
			Computer, transfer power from warp
			engines to life support.
			Transfer complete.
			Activate Bussard collector.
			Activated. Breach of dilithium
			chamber in forty seconds.
			Reconfigure hydrogen-plasma
			mixture to include thirty percent
			nitrium.
			Mixture complete.
			Project emitter beam, heading
			zero-two-four, mark
			zero-four-one.
			Structural integrity of the
			dilithium chamber is at
			twenty-eight percent and holding.
			Mister Data... ?
			The plan was successful, sir.
			Well done...
			Mister Worf... coordinate your
			teams with Doctor Crusher and
			Commander La Forge... assess
			damage and injury.
			Aye, Captain.
			Captain's log, stardate 45733.6.
			Temporary repairs to the ship have
			been completed.
			Our attention now turns to matters
			of a more festive nature.
			You'd think she'd at least get
			to her own wedding on time.
			Minister, this is infamous.
			Infamous!... We leave immediately!
			Ahhhhh... heavenly. Every pore
			is tingling with contentment...
			Isn't it wonderful how things work
			out, Alexander? I wanted to teach
			you how to grab the joys of
			life... and then you turned
			around and taught me not to let
			go of them. How very mutual...
			We still have to learn how to live
			in the real world. All of us,
			Mother.
			When necessary; yes.
			She is right about that,
			Alexander.
			But only when necessary.
			You're just supposed to sit
			here?
			We're having guests for laughing
			hour. Come join us!
			We'd love to!
			No, thank you.
			Yes.
			No.
			Why do you always say "no" when
			I say "yes"?
			I don't.
			You just did.
			There you go again. You are the
			most negative person!
			You're the one who said "no."
			Now it's my fault?
			I didn't say anything about fault.
			Yes, you did.
			You're wrong, as usual.
			I'm not usually wrong. I'm never
			wrong.
			You're wrong if you think you're
			never wrong.
			And you're being negative again!
			I most certainly am not!
			You just were -- you're being
			negative when you say you're not
			negative!
			And you're being stubborn and
			narrow-minded.
			You could not be more wrong. As
			usual.
			I'm not usually wrong. I'm never
			wrong.
			You're wrong if you think you're
			never wrong.
			Now who's being negative?
			You.
			I don't think so. You are the
			most negative person.
			How can you say that? It's simply
			not true.
			Every time you open your mouth,
			you say something negative.
			You're the one who is negative.
			You negate everything I say.
			I do not.
			And you are extremely stubborn.
			I am not. You are!
			I - am - not!
