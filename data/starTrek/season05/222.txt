			I like to cook all kinds of stuff.
			Like yogurt and raisin salad...
			chocolate-chip pancakes... and
			purple omelettes.
			Purple omelettes?
			You put grape juice in the eggs.
			Isabella doesn't like it very much
			-- she says it tastes funny.
			I can see her point...
			Sugar with your tea?
			Yes, please.
			Isabella... would you like some
			too?
			Yes. But she takes two cubes.
			I'll bet Isabella is very pretty.
			She's very, very pretty. She has
			blonde hair and a blue dress with
			white buttons. Her ears are
			pierced. And she's tall.
			Maybe you could draw me a picture.
			I'd love to see what she looks
			like.
			You don't think she's real.
			I think she's real for you, Clara.
			And that's real enough for me.
			Honey, I think it's time for you
			to go. You don't want to keep
			Keiko waiting.
			I have to go plant the nasturtiums
			now.
			I'm Keiko's helper in the
			arboretum today.
			Is that so?
			Go ahead, Sweetie. Be home for
			dinner.
			I hope to see you soon, Clara.
			Maybe we can be friends.
			Okay.
			Counselor Troi?
			Yes?
			Isabella says she likes you.
			Thank you, Isabella.
			I understand why you're
			concerned... but you have nothing
			to worry about. It's a normal,
			healthy activity for children to
			engage in imaginary play.
			I'm just afraid she's not making
			real friends. She spends all of
			her time with "Isabella"...
			You've been moving from starship
			to starship since Clara was two
			years old. Maybe Isabella
			provides a constant companion for
			Clara. She knows this is one
			friend she won't have to leave
			behind.
			You're probably right.
			Give Clara a chance. As she
			learns to make friends on the
			Enterprise, she'll probably move
			away from her imaginary world.
			Captain's log, stardate 45852.1.
			The Enterprise has arrived at
			FGC-four-seven -- a nebula which
			has formed around a neutron star.
			We are eager to investigate this
			unique formation.
			We've got elevated quantities of
			hydrogen... helium... trionium...
			but nothing the shields can't
			handle.
			Shields up.
			Take us in, Ensign. One-quarter
			impulse.
			Aye, sir.
			In order to complete the scheduled
			observations, the lateral sensors
			will require additional processing
			time.
			We could steal a couple of hours
			while they're recalibrating the
			thermal interferometery scanner.
			Will a couple of hours be enough
			time to complete the
			high-resolution series on the
			neutron star?
			No problem. We'll just double
			up the main sensor bandwidth.
			After dinner, then what?
			We went to the holodeck and took
			a walk on the Champs Elysees...
			The neural scanner still seems
			a bit off. Let's check the sensor
			calibration...
			I'll run a diagnostic...
			And... ?
			And?
			After Paris... ?
			He has shore leave next month.
			He asked me to go to Risa with
			him.
			No problem. Nurse Davila can
			cover for you.
			I don't know if I'm going, Doctor.
			I hear it's a very uninhibited
			atmosphere. Personally, I don't
			think I'm ready for that kind of
			"fun."
			Try to talk him into Telana Minor
			instead -- they've got a cruise
			down the Jokri River... the
			iridescent currents are beautiful.
			See, Isabella... you have to push
			your finger into the soil as deep
			as you can.
			The baby seeds are very small...
			so we mustn't give them too much
			to drink.
			Hello? Is somebody there?
			Hello.
			Isabella?
			Hello, Clara.
			Isabella... How come I can see
			you?
			Is something wrong with the way
			I look?
			No. I've just never seen you
			before. Not for real.
			Well... now you can see me for
			real. Doesn't that make you
			happy?
			Yes... it's wonderful!
			Can we go now?
			We should finish planting the
			seeds.
			I'm tired of planting. Let's do
			something else.
			Like what?
			Like...
			I would really like to explore
			the ship.
			We should finish planting first.
			I promised Keiko.
			We can finish later. Let's go
			look around.
			I'd better ask my daddy.
			Your daddy won't mind. We can
			tell him later. Come on...
			So what are we going to name this
			nebula? "FGC-four-seven" just
			doesn't have a nice ring to it.
			Why don't we call it... "Sutter's
			Cloud?"
			The rotational period of the
			neutron star is one point three
			five seconds.
			That's a bit on the long side.
			Sutter -- let's see if we can get
			a reading on the particle flux.
			Aye, sir.
			I was thinking more along the
			lines of "The La Forge Nebula."
			Sounds sort of majestic, don't
			you think?
			Based on those selections, I would
			prefer FGC-four-seven.
			What was that?
			It felt like we hit something.
			Shields have registered an impact.
			But the sensors show nothing in
			the vicinity.
			Forward velocity is down by point
			two percent. And dropping...
			Engineering. Report.
			Could be a problem with the
			shields, Captain. We're checking
			it out now.
			Systems are normal, sir.
			So -- did we hit something or not?
			Shields say yes, sensors say no...
			this is very strange...
			Ensign, give me a breakdown
			on shield energy conversion.
			Run a spectral --
			Whoa. Where did you come from?
			I'm Clara Sutter.
			That's my daddy.
			Clara, you can't be here right
			now.
			But Isabella wanted to see
			engineering.
			I don't care what Isabella wanted
			to see. Go back to our quarters
			right now.
			But Daddy...
			Bridge to La Forge. Our speed
			is still dropping.
			I'm increasing power to the
			impulse engines... but forward
			velocity isn't consistent with
			engine output.
			Explanation.
			It looks like something is
			increasing the drag coefficient
			on the ship. But we can't find
			the cause...
			If you can't correct it... we're
			going to have to reverse course
			and leave the nebula.
			Give me a couple of minutes,
			sir...
			Clara -- now.
			Sorry, Commander.
			Why do you keep disappearing like
			that?
			The grown-ups don't think I'm
			real. When they're around, I have
			to be invisible.
			Wait here.
			The drag coefficient continues
			to increase. Forward velocity has
			fallen by twelve percent.
			Our speed is increasing...
			The ship's speed has stabilized
			at one-quarter impulse.
			Great, Data. What'd you do?
			I did nothing, Commander.
			The problem seems to have
			corrected itself.
			Where did you go?
			There was something I had to do.
			I don't have an explanation, sir.
			We seemed to hit something... and
			then we started losing speed.
			But so far as we can tell, there's
			nothing out there to hit.
			Could some kind of damping field
			cause us to lose velocity?
			We simulated several such fields,
			but were unable to reproduce the
			same drag coefficient.
			We also don't know why the problem
			suddenly corrected itself.
			It seems we're observing a unique
			phenomenon... one that hasn't
			been recorded before.
			The question is, do we stay here
			and check it out?
			That may be dangerous.
			Since we have experienced the
			phenomenon only once, it is
			impossible to estimate the risks.
			I'd like to stick around a little
			longer, sir... collect a sample
			of the gaseous matter, see what
			it tells us...
			Agreed. Collect your sample,
			Mister La Forge. We'll proceed
			-- with caution.
			Dismissed.
			What's in here?
			That's the door to the cargo bay.
			We can't go in there.
			Let's go someplace with lots of
			people.
			Okay.
			Isabella, why are you so serious
			lately?
			What do you mean?
			You haven't even smiled once
			today.
			You're my best friend, Isabella.
			Why?
			I don't know. Because we do
			things together... and we trade
			secrets.
			Does everybody have a best friend?
			If they're lucky. Before I had
			you, I didn't have one...
			Why not?
			Every time I made friends with
			someone... my daddy's job would
			change and we'd move to a new ship.
			And it takes time to make best
			friends...
			How long?
			It depends. With you... not very
			long. You always listened to me,
			even when I was sad...
			Clara... I'm glad we're best
			friends.
			Race you.
			Okay.
			Ready... set ... go!
			This area is not designated for
			children.
			Are you lost?
			Where are you supposed to be?
			We were only playing. We're
			sorry.
			Return to your quarters. And we
			will forget this incident.
			Thank you!
			Okay... I've configured the
			magnetic coils to collect gaseous
			matter from the nebula. Go ahead
			and activate the beam emitter.
			I'm setting the fractionater to
			a continuous cycle...
			We'll take samples from eight
			random sections. That should give
			us a reliable measure.
			Commander...
			I understand... that you had a
			parent in Starfleet.
			Two of them, as a matter of fact.
			My father was an exozoologist...
			my mother a command officer.
			They must have been posted to a
			lot of different assignments...
			That's putting it mildly. They
			were always on the move... some
			of the time together, some times
			separately... I never knew if
			I was going to be stationed with
			my dad while he studied
			invertebrates in the Modean
			system... or with my mom on some
			outpost near the Neutral Zone.
			Was that hard on you?
			I don't remember it that way...
			But... it must have been
			disruptive if you didn't stay
			in one place long enough to make
			friends...
			I guess there were things about
			my childhood that weren't ideal...
			but to me, it was like one long
			adventure.
			Kids are tougher than you think.
			As long as they know you love
			them... they can handle just
			about anything life throws at
			them.
			Thanks, Commander.
			I see... a Samarian coral fish...
			with its fins unfolded...
			I believe what you are seeing is
			the effect of the fluid dynamic
			processes inherent to large scale
			motion of highly rarified gas.
			No... first it was a fish... now
			I see a Mintonian sailing ship...
			Where?
			Right there -- see how the two
			swirls come up to form a mast...
			I do not see it.
			It is interesting that people try
			to find meaningful patterns in
			things that are essentially
			random. I have noticed that the
			images they perceive can sometimes
			suggest what they are thinking
			about at that particular moment.
			Besides, it is clear that this
			cloud formation most closely
			resembles a "bunny rabbit."
			I think someone's lost her way...
			Hello there. Are you looking for
			someone?
			No... I brought Isabella to see
			Ten Forward.
			Well, ordinarily you're supposed
			to be here with a grown-up... but
			since you've brought Isabella,
			you can be my guest.
			Thank you.
			How about two glasses of Papalla
			juice... with extra bubbles.
			Yes, thank you --
			Just one, please. Isabella isn't
			thirsty.
			One juice...
			You're not like the other
			grown-ups.
			Oh, no?
			They don't think Isabella's real.
			Sometimes grown-ups have a tough
			time believing in things they
			can't see.
			Why?
			Well... they tend to get very
			preoccupied with grown-up things.
			Like what?
			Oh... like figuring out how much
			fuel it takes to power this
			ship... or deciding whether to
			explore one star system or
			another... arranging schedules,
			making lists, counting inventory,
			or... wondering if little girls
			should go to bed at seven... or be
			allowed to stay up till eight.
			Their heads can get so full...
			that there's no room left for the
			things you and I know are important.
			Like invisible friends.
			If nobody else understands... how
			come you do?
			Maybe because when I was your age,
			I had an invisible friend, too.
			You did? What was she like?
			It wasn't a she.
			What was he like?
			It wasn't a he.
			It?
			It was a Tarcassian razor beast.
			It had dark brown fur, gold
			eyes... huge spiny wings... It
			could fly so fast that no one
			could see it... except me.
			Sounds scary.
			It was... especially when it
			smiled.
			But the best thing about it was
			that I could curl up and lie on
			its furry stomach. It had the
			deepest, softest purr you've ever
			heard... it put me to sleep
			every night...
			That razor beast was a good
			friend.
			So is Isabella.
			Hello, Clara.
			Hello...
			I was just talking with Clara and
			Isabella.
			Clara... would you and Isabella
			like to take a walk with me?
			I guess so.
			'Bye.
			See you later, Clara...
			Isabella.
			Clara, you haven't been on this
			ship very long, so maybe you don't
			know that Ten Forward is usually
			for grown-ups.
			I know that. I didn't want to
			go. But Isabella wanted to see
			it.
			If Isabella is telling you to do
			things you know are wrong... then
			you must tell her it's not
			acceptable.
			I tried to. But she wouldn't
			listen.
			Deck thirty-two.
			Would you like me to talk to
			Isabella for you?
			Isabella... it's not very nice
			to tell Clara to do things she
			isn't supposed to.
			She's over here.
			From now on... I want you to ask
			a grown-up before you go places
			that are off-limits.
			What did she say?
			She said...
			Clara. Please tell me what
			Isabella said.
			She said... you better leave us
			alone.
			I'm a little concerned about the
			turn this is taking. It seems
			Clara is starting to do
			inappropriate things... and she's
			blaming them on Isabella.
			She came into engineering today...
			and said it was Isabella's idea.
			I don't think it's too serious
			yet. But we should make more of
			an effort to get her involved with
			real friends her own age.
			The Children's Center is having
			a ceramics class this afternoon.
			Why don't I take Clara?
			I think she'd like that.
			I'll see if there's room left in
			the class. In the meantime, make
			yourself available to Clara. Let
			her know she doesn't have to rely
			on Isabella when she needs someone
			to talk to.
			Thank you, Counselor.
			Are you mad at me?
			I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
			That's okay.
			Are we still... best friends?
			Here -- you can help me put this
			together, if you want.
			Clara... Why are grown-ups so
			mean?
			They're not mean -- they're just
			more serious than we are.
			Sometimes I wish they'd just go
			away.
			You do?
			Yes... I don't like them.
			I'm bored. Let's go back to
			engineering.
			We're not allowed to go there.
			I thought we were best friends.
			We are.
			Then why won't you play with me?
			I told you...
			You always listen to the
			grown-ups. You don't care about
			me.
			That's not true.
			I thought we'd have fun
			together, once you could really
			see me. I thought you'd like
			me...
			Let's go to engineering, Clara.
			Just for a little while. No one
			will know -- it'll be our secret.
			And if they find us, we'll tell
			them we got lost...
			Who is it?
			Counselor Troi.
			Hello, Clara.
			Hi.
			I came to ask if you'd like to
			come to a ceramics class.
			Can Isabella come, too?
			No, Clara. We'll do something
			with Isabella another day.
			Well...
			Okay.
			Sir, as we move deeper into the
			nebula, sensors indicate that
			levels of helium and trionium have
			continued to rise steadily
			Is it anything the shields can't
			handle?
			No, sir, we are well within
			tolerance levels --
			Mister Data -- ?
			Shields have registered an impact,
			sir...
			But sensors don't show anything
			out there, right?
			No, sir. There is no indication
			of anything near the ship.
			Forward velocity is dropping,
			Captain. Down by point-four
			percent.
			Can we go to warp speed?
			Until we determine the cause of
			the drag coefficient, I would not
			recommend it, sir.
			Forward velocity is down by one
			point one percent.
			Ensign, increase power to the
			impulse engines.
			Aye, sir.
			Impulse engines are now at full
			power.
			We are no longer losing speed.
			Forward velocity is holding
			steady. The drag coefficient is
			still present, but it has
			stabilized.
			Bridge to Commander Riker... check
			with Mister La Forge... see if
			he's found anything in that matter
			sample from the nebula.
			On my way, sir.
			Any luck?
			Yeah -- take a look at this...
			We tried radiating the matter
			sample with just about everything
			we could think of. We didn't find
			anything... until we subjected
			it to a high frequency warp
			field...
			This may be what we've been
			running into...
			Do you know what it is?
			We think so. Now that the sensors
			can read it, it seems to be a
			highly cohesive form of plasma
			-- like a strand of energy.
			We figure this segment is just
			part of a network of much larger
			strands.
			When these things come in contact
			with our shields, it produces a
			resonant effect -- and creates the
			drag coefficient we've been
			experiencing.
			Anything like this on record?
			No.
			Any idea how many more of these
			there might be?
			No. But if we run the warp field
			generators through the deflector
			grid, we could radiate a field
			outside the ship.
			... and we'd see for ourselves.
			Let's do it.
			Aye.
			Alexander, I thought you might
			like a partner.
			This is Clara Sutter. She's new
			on board. Clara, meet Alexander
			Rozhenko.
			I'm making a cup for my father.
			Wanna help?
			It's alright...
			You gotta put them all in a row...
			like this...
			Clara, would you like some clay
			of your own?
			I've never made a cup before.
			How do you do the round part?
			It's easy. Just take a big piece
			of clay, and push your hand into
			it...
			Warp field generators are standing
			by.
			Captain -- we should be able to
			illuminate any strands within two
			thousand kilometers of the ship.
			Proceed.
			Initiating field generation...
			Remarkable...
			It is an irregular lattice
			composed of approximately
			forty-seven million strands of
			energy.
			Captain -- with this many out
			there, the resonant effect on
			our shields could cause a
			problem...
			Agreed. Ensign -- bring us about
			and take us out of the nebula.
			That may be difficult, sir.
			I am now detecting a significant
			number of strands behind us.
			Do your best, Ensign.
			Aye, sir.
			Hot chocolate.
			Computer -- list my appointment
			schedule for next week.
			Kryonian Tigers aren't so scary.
			I saw one once.
			You did?
			My father took me to the zoo on
			Brentalia. All the tiger did
			was lick my hand. And he smelled
			funny.
			I think we need more water.
			I'll get some.
			Isabella?
			Clara!
			I didn't do it.
			Then who did?
			It was Isabella.
			I don't see anybody.
			She's invisible.
			I worked two weeks on this. That
			was really mean.
			I didn't do it! I didn't!
			There's no such thing as invisible
			people. You're lying!
			Hey!
			Isabella, STOP!
			Clara...
			Why are you being so mean to me?
			Why'd you do that to my friend?
			Because you ran away from me.
			You left me alone. I had to do
			everything by myself...
			You're scaring me.
			I was going to protect you, Clara.
			I liked you...
			But now I don't care. Now... when
			the others come... you can die
			along with everyone else.
			Status, Mister Data?
			At our current speed, we will
			clear the nebula in twelve
			minutes, four seconds.
			Continue full sensor sweeps. I
			want all the information we can
			gather.
			Captain -- forward velocity down
			point six percent.
			Velocity down two point four
			percent.
			Mister Data?
			We are moving through a dense
			concentration of energy strands.
			Can we go to warp?
			The stress on the hull would be
			too great...
			Captain -- density appears to be
			lower off the starboard bow.
			Ensign, bring us to bearing
			oh-three-oh mark five.
			Aye, sir...
			Forward velocity holding...
			Steady as she goes...
			Something wrong with the cake?
			Pardon me?
			When I see you with a piece of
			chocolate cake... that hasn't been
			touched... either the cake's no
			good -- or something's bothering
			you.
			I'm sure the cake is fine. I've
			just been thinking...
			Let me guess... about a little
			girl and her imaginary friend.
			I'm just... wondering... if I'm
			doing the right thing.
			How so?
			I know the best thing to do is
			to gradually wean her away from
			her fantasy... And today she did
			meet some new friends, and had
			a good time with them.
			But?
			But... at the same time, I can't
			help wondering if I'm stealing
			something from her... something
			precious...
			... a part of her childhood that
			she'll never have again.
			I don't know about that. I was
			just telling Clara about my
			imaginary friend.
			Your imaginary friend?
			Yeah -- a Tarcassian razor beast.
			It protected me. I knew nothing
			could ever hurt me as long as I
			had that razor beast around.
			Over the years, its body kind of
			faded away. What was left was
			more of an idea than a thing.
			I don't talk to it nearly as much
			as I used to.
			You still talk to it?
			All the time. When I get
			scared... or confused... or I
			need help. The way I see it, you
			don't ever have to lose your
			imaginary friend.
			If it's something you need in your
			life -- it'll be there.
			It just might not be called an
			imaginary friend anymore.
			Ensign Sutter to Counselor Troi.
			Go ahead, Ensign.
			Would you come to my quarters?
			I'm having a problem with Clara.
			On my way.
			She won't even go into her room.
			She's terrified "Isabella" is
			going to hurt her.
			Clara... your father tells me
			Isabella has been saying some very
			bad things to you.
			What did she say?
			She said they were going to come
			and kill everyone.
			Who's going to come and kill
			everyone?
			The others... like her.
			Did she say why?
			I know you must be very
			frightened. Sometimes what we
			imagine can be just as scary as
			something real.
			But I promise you -- there's no
			way Isabella can harm you or
			anyone on this ship.
			But she's not imaginary anymore.
			She's real now. I can see
			her...
			You can see her... ?
			Yes.
			If I go with you and hold your
			hand, will you go into your room?
			I think so...
			We'll make sure Isabella isn't
			anywhere around. Alright?
			Come on.
			Do you see anybody?
			Let's look under the bed...
			Is she there?
			Now... where else?
			Is she behind here?
			Maybe Isabella's gone home...
			Anything there?
			Maybe Isabella knows you're making
			new friends now.
			In fact, I'll bet she won't be
			coming around as much anymore...
			What about the closet?
			Oh. Okay...
			Anybody in here?
			She was eleven, maybe twelve...
			with blonde hair...
			Clara...
			Clara's sleeping. She's going
			to be fine.
			Her bioelectrical processes were
			severely disrupted. It's like
			the energy was pulled right out
			of her body.
			Captain... Clara told me her
			imaginary friend was making
			threats. She claimed that others
			were on the way... and that they
			were going to kill everyone on
			the ship.
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf.
			Worf here.
			We have established the presence
			of what appears to be an alien
			entity on board.
			It seems the entity has manifested
			itself in the form of a twelve-
			year-old girl who has been seen
			with Clara Sutter. She has blonde
			hair... blue eyes...
			... and a blue dress? Yes sir,
			I have seen her.
			When?
			Two days ago, near engineering.
			She was with Miss Sutter.
			Engineering... Security Alert,
			Mister Worf. Be on the lookout.
			Aye, sir.
			She insisted on talking to you.
			It's about Isabella...
			What about her, Clara?
			I think her feelings were hurt.
			She said she liked me... that she
			liked being with me. She was my
			friend. She only got mean when
			I stopped paying attention to
			her...
			Did she say when the others were
			coming?
			Thanks, Sweetie. Go back to bed
			now... we'll handle this.
			But Daddy...
			Thank you, Clara. If we need
			your help again, I hope we can
			count on you.
			Yes, Captain.
			Captain Picard -- report to the
			the bridge.
			On my way.
			Report.
			Our speed is down by twenty-two
			percent.
			Strand density is ten times what
			it was, Captain. We can't take
			many more hits...
			All stop.
			Sir -- something is heading
			toward us, bearing one-oh-three
			mark oh-two-four.
			On screen.
			What is it?
			It appears to be an energy
			vortex... of highly complex
			patterns. Very possibly a life
			form.
			Red Alert!
			It is in direct physical contact
			with the shields.
			Shields dropping to seventy-five
			percent... seventy-two percent...
			The damn thing's feeding off
			our shields. Data -- remodulate
			the shield frequencies!
			Aye, sir.
			No effect.
			Shields to sixty-four percent.
			We have about eight minutes before
			those things drain our shields.
			Any ideas?
			Isabella... Isabella...
			Isabella... Don't you want to talk
			to me? I'm not mad at you...
			We know you've been on the ship
			for some time now. We know you've
			been posing as Clara's friend --
			and that you've been threatening
			her...
			We can only assume there's a
			connection between you and the
			life-forms attacking our ship...
			You are obviously an intelligent
			being. There's no reason for
			you to hide...
			Talk to us. Or can you only
			communicate by frightening a small
			child?
			I'm scared, Isabella...
			Who are you?
			I came here to determine whether
			you were a threat to us. And to
			examine the purity of your energy
			sources.
			Energy... is that why they're
			draining our shields?
			Yes. The emissions from your
			graviton field generators are
			far richer than our normal
			sources of energy.
			Picard to bridge. Report.
			Shields are down to three percent.
			We're diverting all available
			power.
			Acknowledged.
			If it's energy you want, we can
			provide it in other ways. You
			needn't destroy us.
			You should be destroyed. You are
			cruel, uncaring creatures.
			What makes you say that?
			The way you treat Clara.
			In what way did we mistreat her?
			You wouldn't let her do what she
			wanted to... or go where she
			wanted to...
			You mean where you wanted her to.
			Why does that make a difference?
			You were taking her to places that
			were inappropriate -- even
			dangerous.
			I wouldn't have let anything
			happen to her...
			We had no way of knowing that.
			We had no way of knowing you were
			real. All we knew was that a
			little girl's imaginary friend
			was scaring her... threatening
			her...
			That was only after you tried to
			keep her from being my friend.
			I'm beginning to understand.
			You've seen this ship... all of
			us... from a unique perspective
			-- a child's point of view. It
			must have seemed terribly unfair
			and restrictive...
			As adults, we don't always stop
			to realize how everything we say
			and do shapes the impressions of
			young people.
			But if you are to judge us as a
			people by the way we treat our
			children... and I cannot think
			of a better criterion... you must
			understand how deeply we care for
			them. When our children are
			young, they cannot always
			understand what might be
			dangerous. Our rules are a way
			to keep them from harm. Either
			real or imagined.
			This is part of the continuity
			of the Human species. You see...
			when Clara grows up, she will make
			rules for her children... to
			protect them... just as we
			protect her.
			Please don't hurt us.
			If you still want to be my best
			friend, I'd like it very much.
			Status, Number One?
			We're free of the strands. We'll
			have full warp capability in
			twenty minutes.
			Notify all sections we'll be
			leaving the area in one hour.
			Sir?
			Mister La Forge, I want you to
			drive the warp engines to full
			power, and direct a flow of energy
			out into the nebula.
			Aye, sir...
			I came to say... I'm sorry I
			frightened you.
			It's okay.
			And I misled you. I wasn't really
			your Isabella.
			For a while you were.
			I never had a friend before.
			I'm sorry I have to go away.
			Do you think you'll ever come
			back?
			I hope so.
			So do I.
