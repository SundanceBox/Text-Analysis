			Captain's log, stardate 45047.2.
			The Enterprise is en route to an
			uninhabited planet in the El-Adrel
			system. The location is mid-way
			between Federation space and the
			territory occupied by an enigmatic
			race known as "The Children of
			Tama."
			The Tamarians apparently arrived
			at El-Adrel Four nearly three
			weeks ago. They've been
			transmitting a subspace signal
			toward Federation space ever
			since.
			The signal is a standard
			mathematical progression. It does
			not carry a specific message.
			But they want us to know they're
			there.
			Apparently so. Starfleet
			believes their presence is an
			attempt to start a dialogue.
			Commander.
			Federation vessels have
			encountered Tamarian ships seven
			times over the past one hundred
			years. Each meeting was without
			incident, but formal relations
			were never established because
			communication was not possible.
			Why?
			The Children of Tama were called
			"incomprehensible" by Captain
			Silvestri of the Shiku Maru.
			Other accounts are comparable.
			A cause for concern. For all
			we know, they are threatening
			our border.
			Everything in the previous
			encounters suggests a peaceable
			race. We have to start from
			there.
			Agreed. I appreciate your
			prudence, Lieutenant Worf. But
			given the evidence, Starfleet has
			arrived at a reasonable
			conclusion. The Tamarians have
			extended a hand -- we must do the
			same.
			The "Children of Tama." I've
			heard rumors about them for years.
			As have I, Number One.
			Are they truly "incomprehensible"?
			In my experience, communication
			is a function of patience and
			imagination. I'd like to think
			we have both qualities in
			sufficient measure.
			... Rai and Jiri at Lungha. Rai
			of Lowani. Lowani under two
			moons. Jiri of Ubaya. Ubaya of
			crossed roads. At Lungha.
			Lungha. Her sky grey.
			Rai and Jiri. At Lungha...
			Counselor...
			I'm picking up nothing but good
			intentions, Captain.
			Data?
			The Tamarian seems to be stating
			the proper names of individuals
			and locations.
			But what does it all mean?
			I am at a loss, sir.
			Captain, I invite you to consider
			the creation of a mutual
			non-aggression pact between our
			two peoples. Possibly leading
			to a trade agreement and cultural
			interchange. Does this sound like
			a reasonable course of action?
			Kadir beneath Mo Moteh.
			The river Temarc.
			In winter.
			Impressions, Number One.
			They seem to be trying their best.
			As are we. For what it's worth.
			Captain.
			Darmok.
			Darmok? Rai and Jiri at Lungha.
			Shaka. When the walls fell...
			Zima at Anzo. Zima and Bakor.
			Darmok at Tanagra.
			Shaka!
			Mirab. His sails unfurled.
			Darmok.
			Mir--
			--Temarc!
			The river Temarc...
			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.
			Block their transporter with the
			shields! Extend to maximum range!
			Not enough time!
			Where is he?
			The Tamarians have transported
			Captain Picard to the surface.
			With their own captain...
			Riker to O'Brien --
			-- Transport will not be possible,
			Commander. The Tamarian ship has
			created a particle scattering
			field in the planet's ionosphere.
			Riker to Captain Picard...
			Captain, do you read me?
			Can we compensate?
			No, sir. The Tamarians are
			projecting a particle sustaining
			beam into the upper atmosphere.
			The result is a hyperionization
			that disrupts virtually all EM
			and subspace carriers.
			That means they can't communicate
			with their man, either. Or beam
			anybody through the field.
			That is correct. However, they
			have left sensor frequencies
			clear.
			So they can read what's going on?
			Analysis, Mister Worf. What the
			hell is going on?
			A contest, perhaps.
			Between champions. Our captain
			against theirs.
			Theirs was armed...
			Darmok and Jalad.
			You expect me to fight -- is that
			it? A challenge?
			Darmok and Jalad.
			I don't know who or what Darmok
			and Jalad are. But I didn't come
			here to start a war.
			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.
			I refuse.
			Would you attack an unarmed man,
			Captain? There's not much of a
			challenge in that.
			Temba. His arms wide.
			I'm sorry, Captain.
			Shaka... When the walls fell...
			Sensors show the captain and the
			Tamarian in apparent good health,
			approximately twenty meters from
			each other.
			Lieutenant, hail the Tamarian
			ship.
			On screen.
			You are holding our captain. I
			want him released.
			Darmok at Tanagra.
			Your actions can be interpreted
			as an act of war.
			Kiteo. His eyes closed.
			Chenza at court. The court of
			silence.
			Chenza...
			Is there any way to get through
			to them?
			Not without further study.
			Mister Worf, close the channel.
			Gladly, sir.
			I want you and a security team
			to take a shuttle down to the
			planet. Bring back the captain.
			Aye, Commander.
			Sir, the Tamarians are fully
			capable of stopping a shuttle.
			I'm aware of that. But disrupting
			our transporter beam is one thing.
			Firing on a shuttle is something
			else entirely. I'm betting
			they're not gonna push it that
			far.
			Shaka. When the walls fell.
			"Shaka" indeed.
			What now, Captain? Will you
			attack me in my sleep?
			If I don't freeze to death
			first...
			Darmok of Kanza. Jalad of the
			Kituay.
			Picard of the Federation.
			Of the starship Enterprise... Of
			the planet Earth...
			Kadir beneath Mo Moteh...
			Temba.
			Temba? What do you mean? Fire?
			Temba means fire?
			Temba. His arms wide.
			Temba is a person? His arms are
			wide. Because he's holding
			them apart? In generosity?
			In giving? In taking?
			Temba. His arms wide.
			Thank you.
			Thank you.
			First Officer's log, supplemental.
			I am sending a shuttlecraft to
			find Captain Picard, gambling that
			the Tamarians will back down
			rather than risk an exchange of
			phaser fire. But I feel like I'm
			playing a deadly game -- the
			captain's life is the prize, and
			I still don't know the rules.
			The positron density is point zero
			one three. Electron concentration
			is seven point nine-five.
			We are two hundred fifty
			kilometers from the planet's
			surface.
			The shuttle has reached the E
			region of the planet's ionosphere.
			How long can we maintain
			communications?
			The scattering layer induced by
			the Tamarians is concentrated in
			the upper D region. The shuttle
			will enter that area in
			approximately two minutes.
			The Tamarian ship?
			Unchanged, sir. They appear to
			be making no attempt to stop us.
			Maybe we called their bluff.
			Status, Mister Worf.
			Navigational, life-support,
			propulsion normal. Onboard
			systems do not appear to be
			disrupted by the field. But I
			can barely read you, Commander.
			Acknowledged, Lieutenant.
			Maintain contact as long as
			conditions permit --
			-- Commander! I am reading a
			power surge in the Tamarian plasma
			reactor.
			Mister Worf! Evasive maneuver
			sequence delta!
			-- Maneuver sequence delta!
			Maneuver sequence --
			Commander, the shuttle has been
			hit.
			Damage.
			The starboard nacelle has been
			rendered inoperable.
			That's all?
			Riker to Lieutenant Worf.
			Report.
			Starboard thrusters destroyed.
			Commander, I may be able to land.
			I will not be able to take off.
			Understood, Lieutenant. Return
			to the Enterprise.
			Aye, sir.
			Enough to make them turn back,
			but not enough to hurt them.
			Yes, sir. The phaser pulse
			appears to have been carefully
			attenuated for just that effect.
			Nice shooting...
			I'm pretty sure I can punch up
			the annular confinement beam --
			enough to transport the captain
			through the field. But it's gonna
			take a full day at least.
			Captain Picard could be dead by
			then.
			I do not believe so.
			I have confidence in his ability
			as a warrior. He will be
			victorious.
			You're still assuming this is some
			sort of a challenge ritual. We
			can't be certain of that.
			Agreed. We're making educated
			guesses about their motivations
			-- no more than that.
			Then why do we wait? If we attack
			the ship directly, they will be
			unable to maintain the scattering
			field.
			Which could start a shooting
			match, and for all we know, a war.
			And we still might not be able
			to save the captain.
			It will end this stalemate.
			There's too much at risk. I'll
			take that course when it's the
			only one left.
			Who the hell are these people?
			There's got to be some way to get
			through to them.
			As I have said, with further study
			it may be possible to --
			-- Then do it.
			Deanna, help him. I want
			something by oh-nine hundred
			hours.
			Where have you gone to, my friend?
			Forgive the intrusion, Captain.
			But I need some answers.
			Darmok at Tanagra.
			Shaka!
			Mirab. His sails unfurled.
			Darmok.
			Freeze.
			"Darmok." It seems to be a point
			of contention between them.
			Perhaps something the Tamarian
			captain proposed but his First
			Officer didn't like?
			The apparent emotional dynamic
			does seem to support that
			assumption. As with the other
			terms used by the Tamarian, it
			appears to be a proper noun. The
			name clearly carries a meaning
			for them.
			Computer, search for the term
			"Darmok" in all linguistic
			databases compiled for this
			sector.
			Searching...
			"Darmok" is the name of a seventh
			dynasty emperor on Kanda Four...
			A mytho-historical hunter on
			Shantil Three... A colony on
			Malindi Seven...
			A frozen dessert on Razna Five...
			A --
			-- Stop search. Computer, how
			many entries for "Darmok"?
			Forty-seven.
			All our technology and experience:
			our universal translator, our
			years in space -- contacts with
			more alien cultures than I can
			remember...
			I have encountered one-thousand,
			seven-hundred, fifty-four
			non-Human races during my tenure
			with Starfleet.
			... and we still can't even say
			"hello" to these people.
			That is correct.
			A single word can lead to tragedy.
			A word misspoken, misunderstood.
			That could happen here, Data.
			If you and I fail...

			Shantil Three? Computer, cross-
			reference the last entry with
			the previous search index.
			"Darmok" is the name of a
			mytho-historical hunter on Shantil
			Three.
			I think we've got something.
			A captain's log... ?
			Darmok!
			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra!
			I was curious. I meant no harm.
			Shaka!
			Temba! His arms wide! Temba---
			--Enough! I'm not going to
			fight you. You'll just have to---
			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.
			Commander! Sensors are picking
			up an electromagnetic disturbance
			-- approaching the captain's
			position.
			Analysis?
			A variable induction field...
			possibly a life-form.
			How close is it to the captain?
			The field is erratic -- appearing
			and disappearing -- but it seems
			to be moving toward him.
			Attacking?
			Temba. His arms wide.
			I'll go along with that.
			Riker to La Forge.
			La Forge here.
			How close are we on the
			transporter?
			About two hours -- maybe three.
			I want the captain out of there
			now.
			That's not... likely, sir.
			I don't want to hear that,
			Commander.
			What's the resonance frequency?
			Point three four over standard.
			I want a resolution of point five
			three at the very least.
			I'll need two more minutes,
			Commander. But there's a good
			chance this isn't gonna work.
			If it fails...
			I know. We'll have tipped our
			hand to the Tamarians. But that's
			a chance we've got to take.
			Agreed.
			La Forge. Proceed.
			We're on it. La Forge out.
			Riker to transporter room one.
			O'Brien here, Commander.
			Stand by, Mister O'Brien...
			Mirab -- his sails unfurled?
			Come on.
			Shaka. When the walls fell.
			Shaka. When the walls fell.
			Shaka... You said that before.
			When I couldn't build a fire.
			A failure? An inability to do
			something?
			Darmok and Jalad --
			-- at Tanagra.
			I remember the words. But I don't
			understand...
			Matrix levels.
			Annular convergence holding at
			four three nine point two oh five.
			Confinement resolution at point
			five two seven.
			That isn't gonna do it. Increase
			thermal input coefficient to one
			hundred fifty-percent.
			Increasing now...
			Status, La Forge.
			We're almost there, Commander.
			Shunt the overload to the phase
			transition sequencers in
			transporter one.
			Yes, sir.
			La Forge to O'Brien.
			Go ahead, Commander.
			Confirm phase sequencer linkage.
			Link confirmed. Ready whenever
			you are, sir.
			Uzani. His army at Lashmir.
			At Lashmir. Was it like this at
			Lashmir? Similar to what we're
			facing now?
			Uzani...
			His army. With fist open.
			A strategy? With fist open...
			With fist open. Why... ? To lure
			the enemy...
			His army. With fist closed.
			With fist closed. An army.
			Open... to lure the enemy.
			Then closed... To attack. That's
			how you communicate, isn't it?
			By citing example. By metaphor.
			Uzani's army. With fist closed!
			Sokath. His eyes uncovered!
			No --
			I've got a piece of him Commander.
			But that's all...
			La Forge, boost the confinement
			beam!
			One fifty-seven over standard.
			It's as solid as it'll go,
			Commander.
			The Tamarian and the entity are
			in close proximity. The
			Tamarian's lifesigns are
			fluctuating.
			The scattering field is still in
			full force.
			What the hell is wrong with them?
			Their sensors can read what's
			going on as well as ours can.
			Riker to O'Brien. Report.
			The field's still deflecting the
			signal. There just isn't enough
			of him, sir.
			Open a channel to the Tamarian
			ship.
			Aye, sir.
			Your captain is under attack.
			Drop your particle field.
			Kailash...
			When it rises...
			They have closed the channel.
			O'Brien to bridge.
			I can't hold him, Commander.
			Shaka...
			... when the walls fell.
			First Officer's log, stardate
			45047.8. Our attempt to transport
			Captain Picard back to the ship
			has failed. My options are
			narrowing. And my patience is
			all but gone.
			Here's the situation on El-Adrel.
			The entity has moved off several
			hundred meters.
			Captain Picard's bioscan readings
			are stable. The Tamarian's are
			not.
			He may have been injured...
			If the entity attacks again, the
			captain could be facing it alone.
			The transporter's completely out
			of the question. The Tamarian
			ship has deepened the scattering
			field to the D region of the
			ionosphere. There's no getting
			through.
			Unless we attack the ship itself.
			Can you pinpoint the source of
			their particle beam?
			They're using a polarity coil
			generator located aft of their
			warp drive. It's heavily
			shielded.
			Can we get through with our
			phasers?
			Not with the first spread. It'll
			take a few hits.
			That's not good enough. I want
			to be able to knock out the
			scattering field in one shot and
			have the captain back on the
			Enterprise before they know what
			happened.
			If we selectively target the
			amplification pathways around the
			generator, it should be just as
			effective. And we can do it in
			one burst.
			How long to set that up?
			Worf and I will have to adjust
			the prefire chambers. That'll
			give us the focus we need.
			A few hours.
			Get started.
			Aye, sir.
			I'd prefer to find a peaceful
			solution. If we can talk our way
			out of this -- so much the better.
			Unfortunately, it's not that
			simple.
			What have you found?
			The Tamarian ego structure does
			not seem to allow what we normally
			think of as self-identity. Their
			ability to abstract is highly
			unusual. They seem to
			communicate through narrative
			imagery -- by reference to the
			individuals and places which
			appear in their mytho-historical
			accounts.
			It's as if I were to say to you
			"Juliet. On her balcony."
			An image of romance.
			Exactly. Image is everything to
			the Tamarians.
			It embodies their emotional
			states, their very thought
			processes. It's how they
			communicate, and how they think.
			If we know how they think, can't
			we get something across to them?
			No sir. The situation is
			analogous to understanding the
			grammar of a language but none
			of the vocabulary.
			If I didn't know who Juliet was
			or what she was doing on that
			balcony, the image alone wouldn't
			mean anything.
			That's correct. We know, for
			instance, that "Darmok" was a
			great hero -- a hunter. Tanagra
			was an island. But that's all.
			Without the details, there's no
			understanding.
			It is necessary for us to learn
			the narratives from which the
			Tamarians are drawing these
			images.
			Given our current relations, that
			does not appear likely.
			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.
			Our situation is similar to
			theirs. I understand. But I need
			to know more. Tell me more.
			About Darmok and Jalad. Tell
			me...
			You used the words "Temba. His
			arms wide" when you gave me the
			fire. And the dagger. Could that
			mean give?
			Temba. His arms wide. Darmok.
			Give me more about Darmok.
			Darmok on the ocean.
			Darmok.
			The ocean.
			"Darmok on the ocean."
			A metaphor. For being alone?
			Isolated? "Darmok on the ocean."
			Are you alright?
			Kiazi's children. Their faces
			wet.
			Temba. His arms wide. Give me
			more. "Darmok on the ocean... "
			Tanagra on the ocean. Darmok
			at Tanagra.
			"At Tanagra." A country?
			"Tanagra on the ocean." An
			island.
			Temba... His arms wide.
			Jalad on the ocean. Jalad at
			Tanagra.
			"Jalad at Tanagra." He went to
			the same island as Darmok. To
			Tanagra.
			The beast at Tanagra.
			The beast. A creature on the
			island? On Tanagra. Darmok and
			Jalad -- did they fight the beast?
			They arrived separately. They
			struggled against a common foe.
			"The beast at Tanagra. Darmok and
			Jalad."
			Darmok and Jalad on the ocean.
			They left together.
			Darmok and Jalad on the ocean.
			On the ocean--
			Zinda! His face black... His eyes
			red...
			Callimas at Bahar.
			You hoped this would happen,
			didn't you? You knew there was
			a dangerous creature on this
			planet. And you knew from the
			tale of Darmok that danger shared
			can sometimes bring two people
			together.
			Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.
			You and me, here -- at El-Adrel.
			Kira at Bashi.
			Temba. His arms wide...
			My turn? I'm afraid I'm not much
			of a story teller. And you
			wouldn't understand me anyway.
			Shaka... when the walls fell.
			Perhaps that doesn't matter. You
			want to hear it anyway...
			There is a story... A very ancient
			one. From Earth. I'll try to
			remember...
			Gilgamesh. Was a king. At Uruk.
			He tormented his subjects. He
			drove them to anger. They cried
			out -- "Give our king a companion.
			Spare us his madness."
			Enkidu. A wildman. Of the
			forest. Entered the city. They
			fought in the temple. They fought
			in the street. Gilgamesh defeated
			Enkidu. They became friends.
			Gilgamesh and Enkidu. At Uruk.
			At Uruk...
			The new friends went into the
			desert, where the Great Bull of
			Heaven was killing men by the
			hundreds. Enkidu caught it by
			the tail, Gilgamesh struck it with
			his sword.
			Gilgamesh...
			They were victorious. But Enkidu
			fell to the ground. Struck down
			by the gods...
			And Gilgamesh wept bitter tears,
			saying, "He who was my companion
			through adventure and hardships,
			is gone forever... "
			First Officer's log, supplemental.
			I have no choice but to break the
			stalemate. If war is the
			result... Maybe it was
			inevitable. Perhaps the distance
			between our races is so vast that
			nothing else was ever possible...
			Phasers are nearly ready, sir.
			Stand by to fire, Mister Worf.
			Commander. The Tamarian's
			bioscans have become unreadable.
			He may be dead, sir.
			If we know it -- so do the
			Tamarians.
			Riker to La Forge.
			La Forge here.
			I need those phasers --
			Sir -- sensors are tracking the
			entity. It is approaching Captain
			Picard's position.
			I understand your sacrifice,
			Captain.
			Unfortunately, if our friend out
			there has its way, no one will
			ever know what you tried to do...
			Nine meters and closing...
			Commander...
			Six meters...
			La Forge to bridge. You have
			phasers!
			Fire!
			Their particle beam emitters are
			inoperative.
			The scattering field is down.
			O'Brien! Energize!
			We got him, Commander.
			Maximum shields.
			Aye.
			Red Alert.
			Starboard shields holding at
			fifty-two percent. Forward
			shields gone.
			Let's get out of here.
			That will not be possible,
			Commander. The starboard nacelle
			sustained a direct hit. Warp
			engines are off-line.
			Go to impulse. Back us off.
			They are matching our maneuver.
			And firing...
			Return fire, Mister Worf. Full
			phasers.
			Firing, sir.
			Their shields are holding. They
			are firing again.
			Our shields have failed!
			Commander -- we cannot survive
			another hit.
			Hail the Tamarian ship.
			Aye, Captain.
			Zinda! His face black. His eyes
			red --
			--Temarc!
			The river Temarc. In winter.
			Darmok...
			... And Jalad. At Tanagra. Darmok
			and Jalad on the ocean.
			Sokath! His eyes open!
			The beast at Tanagra. Uzani.
			His army.
			Shaka. When the walls fell.
			Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel.
			Mirab. With sails unfurled.
			Temba. His arms open.
			Temba at rest.
			Thank you...
			New friends, Captain?
			I can't say, Number One.
			But at least they're not new
			enemies.
			Come.
			I hope I'm not intruding, Captain.
			Not at all, Number One. Please.
			Damage reports are ready for your
			review.
			Thank you.
			Greek, sir?
			The Homeric Hymns.
			One of the root metaphors of our
			own culture.
			For the next time we encounter
			the Tamarians...
			More familiarity with our own
			mythology might help us relate
			to theirs.
			The Tamarian was willing to risk
			all of us -- just for the hope
			of communication, of connection.
			And now the door's open between
			our peoples. That commitment
			meant more to him than his own
			life.
			Would I do the same... ?
