			Captain's log, stardate 45614.6.
			We have been contacted by an
			androgynous race called the J'naii
			to investigate the disappearance
			of a shuttlecraft.
			We are approaching the designated
			coordinates, Captain.
			On screen.
			Long-range scan, Mister Data.
			Sensors find no evidence of the
			shuttle anywhere within the star
			system.
			It couldn't have travelled outside
			the system.
			Mister Data, reconfigure for a
			high-resolution sweep with a
			radius of one million kilometers.
			Look for possible debris.
			Scan shows no debris within
			that radius.
			I don't understand it. A
			shuttle doesn't simply vanish.
			There has to be an explanation...
			Captain, I am detecting an unusual
			reading... It appears to be a
			neutrino emission with no visible
			source.
			Explanation?
			I have none. I recommend we
			launch a probe.
			Make it so.
			The probe is launched.
			The probe is transmitting
			information within normal
			parameters. Sensors do not show
			evidence of any unusual phenomenon
			--
			The probe is no longer
			transmitting.
			What happened? Where did it go?
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			sudden disappearance of our probe
			suggests that we may have found
			the first instance of what is
			called null space -- an anomaly
			which until now had been only
			theoretical. Commander Riker has
			been working around the clock with
			a team of J'naii specialists to
			formalize this hypothesis.
			During the creation of a star
			system, when clouds of
			interstellar dust and gas
			coalesce... turbulent regions of
			magnetic and gravitational fields
			may develop.
			If certain conditions occur,
			these fields can condense into
			abnormal pockets of space.
			We think your system contains one
			of these null pockets.
			If we're right, this pocket would
			absorb electromagnetic energy from
			anything that entered it...
			Like a shuttlecraft.
			Or a probe. Making them
			powerless.
			But outside the pocket, all energy
			is bent around it -- making it
			naturally cloaked. That's why
			we can't see it, and sensors don't
			read it.
			Is the shuttle still there?
			We think so. The ship probably
			couldn't sustain its power...
			but other than that it wouldn't
			be damaged.
			Since our shuttles carry
			plestorene-based backup systems,
			we think life support would
			sustain for as long as ten days.
			Then perhaps our crew has
			survived...
			We can send one of our shuttles
			into the null space -- but its
			energy output would be absorbed
			as well. Our chief engineer is
			working on a way to maintain the
			power reserves long enough to
			rescue your crew.
			Commander... we're grateful for
			your help.
			Whatever resources we can provide
			are yours.
			I've been thinking... when the
			time comes, I'd like to pilot the
			shuttle.
			It's a Starfleet craft...
			I can't ask you to put yourself
			in danger to rescue our crew.
			You can't pilot a shuttle you're
			not familiar with.
			I happen to be a good pilot...
			I happen to be a good pilot, too.
			I also know my way around
			Starfleet shuttles. So... what
			if we team up?
			When can we go over your shuttle
			flight operations?
			Right now.
			It's a short-range craft... with
			two twelve-hundred fifty
			millicochrane warp engines...
			Looks like microfusion
			thrusters...
			Right.
			Armament?
			Usually none. But it's been
			fitted with two type-four phaser
			emitters... we'll use them to
			chart the null space.
			Chart it?
			Commander La Forge wants to get
			an idea of how big this pocket
			is. He thinks the rate of energy
			absorption will be linked to its
			size.
			I'm not sure how we go about
			mapping something we can't see...
			That's where the emitters come
			in. We'll shoot a series of
			photon pulses into the pocket and
			chart the points where they
			disappear. We should be able to
			plot a fairly complete outline
			that way.
			Let's take a look at the controls.
			Maybe later we can try a flight
			simulation, but first let's do
			a systems review.
			I'll walk you through it...
			Propulsion system... transfer
			conduits... where's the schematic
			of the reactor assembly? Oh,
			there it is... engine nacelles...
			There's nothing here that's
			unfamiliar.
			Navigational deflector...
			redundant graviton polarity source
			generators...
			You're handling those controls
			like you grew up in a shuttle...
			I did. My parents were pilots.
			I started flying with them before
			I could walk. And as soon as I
			was old enough, I entered flight
			school. Krite was my instructor.
			He had a good student.
			"He?" Commander, there are no
			"he's" or "she's" in a species
			without gender.
			Okay. For two days I've been
			trying to construct sentences
			without personal pronouns. I give
			up... what should I say? "It?"
			To us, that's almost rude.
			We use a pronoun which is neutral.
			But it doesn't really have a
			translation.
			Then I'll just have to muddle
			through... so be tolerant if a
			stray "he" or "she" slips by,
			okay?
			Well, if that's the systems
			review, I don't see any problems
			here. What's next?
			Lunch.
			What is it?
			Split pea soup. My father's
			recipe. I had it programmed into
			the replicators.
			Well?
			Unusual... but I think I like
			it...
			It's very healthy. Helps keep
			you warm on a cold Alaskan night.
			We prefer to stay warm by sleeping
			with a friend.
			I see...
			Not to mate... just to sleep
			together. For warmth.
			Sounds better than pea soup.
			We are puzzling to you, aren't
			we?
			A little. It's hard to grasp the
			idea of having no gender...
			It's just as hard for us to
			understand the strange division
			you have in your species... males
			and females.
			You... are male.
			Tell me... about males. What is
			it that makes you different from
			females?
			Snips and snails and puppy dog's
			tails...
			You have a dog's tail?
			That's an old nursery rhyme.
			Girls are made of sugar and spice.
			Boys are made of snips and
			snails...
			That makes it sound better to be
			female.
			It's an old fashioned way of
			looking at the sexes. Not to say
			that there aren't real
			differences. Physically, men tend
			to be bigger... stronger in the
			upper body. We have different
			sexual organs. Men don't bear
			young...
			What about... feelings? Emotional
			attitudes? Are they different?
			Well... most people think so.
			But that's the kind of question
			that might take an hour or two
			to answer.
			Let me ask you...
			What's it like... on a planet where
			the people have no gender?
			I'm afraid I don't understand.
			Well... who leads when you dance?
			If you dance...
			We do... and... whoever's taller
			leads.
			Without the "battle of the
			sexes"... you probably don't
			have as many arguments...
			Just because we don't have gender
			doesn't mean we don't have
			conflict. We're very strong-
			minded... we love a good fight.
			Sounds like there aren't that
			many differences between your
			species and mine...
			Maybe not.
			What kind of woman do you find
			attractive?
			I like a woman who's intelligent
			and sure of herself... somebody
			I can talk to and get something
			back.
			But the most important thing of
			all -- she has to laugh at my
			jokes.
			And is that the kind of woman all
			human males prefer?
			Not at all. Some men like quiet,
			demure women... others prefer a
			lot of energy... some respond only
			to physical attractiveness...
			others couldn't care less. There
			aren't any rules.
			You make it sound very complex.
			Believe me -- it is.
			Perhaps it is that complexity...
			which makes differences in the
			sexes... so interesting.
			Good evening, Commander.
			Good evening.
			Please take my place, Krite. I
			have to be going.
			Thank you for going over the
			flight protocols, Commander. It's
			been very helpful.
			Captain's log, stardate 45616.3.
			Commander Riker and the J'naii
			pilot have set out on a mission
			to chart the null space pocket.
			If they are successful, we can
			then proceed with a rescue
			attempt.
			I've illuminated the delta-four
			grid map. We can start there and
			then expand.
			Stand by forward phaser array...
			The pulse vanished at delta
			four-point-two by point three.
			Firing second burst...
			Delta four-point-four by point
			five.
			It's working. I think we'll be
			able to give Commander La Forge
			the information he needs.
			Delta four-point-five by point
			seven...
			I'm initiating computer task
			hand-off...
			Commander... tell me about your
			sexual organs.
			Ahhh...
			Is that an uncomfortable subject
			for Humans?
			No... but it doesn't tend to be
			a topic of casual
			conversation...
			I'm interested in your mating
			practices... what is involved
			when there are two sexes.
			Correcting course... zero-two-one
			mark zero...
			Mating.
			Right. Well, it's pretty simple.
			The men inseminate the women and
			the women carry the babies.
			Our fetuses are incubated in
			fibrous husks which both parents
			inseminate. From what we know
			of other species, our method is
			less risky and less painful.
			And less enjoyable...
			Less enjoyable?
			For Humans... the sexual act
			brings a closeness... an
			intimacy... it's a very
			pleasurable experience...
			Inseminating a husk...
			That's just the last step. Mating
			is a long ritual for us... full
			of variety and invention... I
			assure you -- it's extremely
			pleasurable.
			I'm picking up a neutrino
			emission... from within the null
			space.
			That may be coming from our
			shuttle. I'll note these
			coordinates.
			I wonder...
			What... ?
			If a Human and a J'naii would be
			sexually compatible...
			I don't know...
			Of course, it would never be
			permitted.
			Why not?
			The idea of gender... it's
			offensive to my people. You see,
			long ago we had two sexes, as
			you do. But we evolved... into
			a higher form.
			I don't mean to sound insulting...
			but on my planet we've been taught
			that gender is...
			...primitive.
			Primitive.
			Less evolved...
			Maybe so. But sometimes there's
			a lot to be said for an experience
			that's... primitive.
			Delta-five grid is fully
			plotted...
			Adjusting course... zero-two-nine
			mark zero.
			The port engine is down...
			Reducing power in the starboard
			nacelle...
			That's not enough... I have to
			activate the maneuvering thrusters
			to correct the spin...
			Thrusters aren't responding...
			I'll try to reroute the firing
			sequence...
			Inertial dampers are failing...
			hang on!
			Enterprise to shuttle... do you
			read me?
			Affirmative... we've lost an
			engine...
			We'll try to get a tractor beam
			on you...
			The sooner the better...
			Enterprise, we have an injury.
			Transport Soren directly to
			sickbay.
			Right away, Commander.
			It's just a mild concussion...
			You're going to be fine.
			This will reduce the inflammation.
			Doctor... you are female.
			Yes...
			Forgive me... I don't mean to be
			rude... but I'm curious. What
			is it like?
			Well... it's... just the way I
			am. I've never thought about what
			it's like.
			What is it that makes you female?
			Very specific biological factors.
			Females carry two X chromosomes,
			males carry an X and a Y. Hormone
			levels are distinctly different;
			males produce primarily
			testosterone, while women produce
			estrogen. Our sexual organs are
			very different -- females' are
			geared to bearing and nursing the
			young.
			I've noticed... that you tend to
			have longer hair... you arrange
			it more elaborately... and you
			apply color to your bodies.
			Color... ?
			You put color on your mouths...
			your eyes... your cheeks... even
			your fingernails. The men don't.
			That's true...
			Why do you decorate yourselves
			like that?
			It's a long-time custom... we're
			used to it...
			... but I think the real reason
			-- is to attract men.
			Really?
			Mmmm-hmmmm...
			Then... it's up to women to
			attract the men?
			Oh, believe me, men want to be
			attractive, too -- but they go
			about it differently.
			No color...
			No color. They'd rather
			pretend they're not doing
			anything to attract a woman...
			even when it's the most important
			thing on their minds.
			It's very confusing.
			Are women considered superior?
			Or are men?
			Neither. In the past, women were
			often considered weak and
			inferior. But that hasn't been
			true for a long time.
			Do you... enjoy being a woman?
			Yes. As a matter of fact, I enjoy
			it a lot.
			Will... your co-pilot is fine.
			The injury was minor.
			I'm glad to hear it.
			I'm afraid you're not rid of me
			yet, Commander. I'll be able to
			complete the mission.
			Then you should hear my new
			regulation: no more gymnastics
			in the shuttlecraft.
			I'm glad you're all right...
			What happened... why did the
			shuttle go into a spin?
			Apparently, the port engine nacelle
			nicked one of the protrusions from
			the null pocket, and shut down.
			Are we still on schedule for the
			rescue attempt?
			That depends on how you're doing.
			I'm fine. We should check out
			the port engine --
			Whoa... let's get the doctor's
			opinion first...
			Doctor... ?
			I don't see a problem. But if
			you have any symptoms... headache,
			dizziness -- come back.
			You have my word.
			All right... this round, the game
			is -- Federation Day.
			What is that?
			The Federation was founded in
			Twenty-one-sixty-one. So twos,
			sixes, and aces are wild.
			That is a woman's game.
			Oh? Why is that?
			All those wild cards... they
			support a weak hand. A man's game
			has no wild cards.
			Let me get this straight. Are
			you saying it's a woman's game
			because -- because women are weak
			and need more help?
			Yes.
			And just this afternoon I was
			insisting to one of the J'naii
			that those attitudes were nothing
			but a distant memory.
			The J'naii...
			They bother me.
			Why, Worf?
			They just do.
			They are all alike. No males.
			No females.
			I'm sure we're just as strange
			to them.
			Well, one of them seems to be
			overcoming the differences... at
			least with regard to one of us...
			What are you saying, Doctor?
			I could be wrong... but I get the
			definite impression that Soren...
			is attracted to Commander Riker.
			A human and a J'naii?
			Impossible.
			Why?
			Good question. Worf?
			With all the wild cards, it is
			difficult to know exactly what
			is in my hand.
			However, I will open with...
			fifty.
			The port engine nacelle functions
			are fully restored... maneuvering
			thrusters are operational...
			The portable transporter array
			is in. Once we get into null
			space, we'll have to initialize
			it before we transport the J'naii
			crew to this shuttle. But there
			should still be enough power left
			to beam all of us back to the
			Enterprise.
			Is the buffer field generator
			installed?
			Not yet. Geordi figures it'll
			be ready to go at oh-eight-hundred
			hours tomorrow.
			We should adjust the engine
			balance before that. Can you
			access the starboard thrust
			manifold?
			There...
			Okay, calibrate it to arc at
			six-point-three while I optimize
			the plasma flow.
			Commander...
			Mmmmm?
			I'd like... to tell you something.
			Something that's not easy to say.
			What's that?
			I... find you attractive.
			I'm taking a terrible risk,
			telling you that. It means...
			revealing something to you...
			Something that, if it were known
			on my planet, would be very
			dangerous for me.
			Occasionally, among my people,
			a few are born who are --
			different. Who are throwbacks
			to the era when we all had gender.
			Some are born with strong
			inclinations toward maleness...
			and some have urges to be female.
			I am one of the latter.
			I have to admit... I got the
			feeling you were different.
			I was hoping you would. But in
			front of Krite and the others,
			I must be careful not to reveal
			myself.
			Why?
			On our world these feelings are
			forbidden. Those who are
			discovered are shamed and
			ridiculed. Only by undergoing
			psychotectic therapy and having
			all elements of gender eliminated
			can they become accepted into
			society again.
			Those of us who have these
			urges... live secret, guarded
			lives.
			We seek each other out... always
			hiding, always terrified of being
			discovered...
			How long have you known you were
			like this?
			I've known I was different all
			my life. But I didn't understand
			how or why until I was older.
			And when you realized... what
			then?
			I remember when I was very
			young... before I understood what
			I was... there was a rumor in
			my school that one of the students
			preferred a gender... in that
			case, male. The children started
			making fun of him... every day,
			they got more cruel... They could
			tell he was afraid... and that
			seemed to encourage them.
			He appeared in class one morning,
			bleeding... his clothes ripped.
			He said he'd fallen down.
			Of course the school authorities
			heard about it... They took him
			away and gave him psychotectic
			treatments.
			When he came back... he stood in
			front of the whole school and told
			us how happy he was now that he
			had been cured.
			After that... I knew how dangerous
			it was to be different. And as
			I got older, and realized what
			I was, I was terrified.
			I've lived with that fear ever
			since.
			Do you have... relationships...
			with others?
			Yes -- with those who have
			discovered they are male.
			I've had to live a life of
			pretense and lies. With you...
			I can be honest.
			Don't say anything. Just... think
			about it.
			Okay, Commander, everything checks
			out. The energy buffer is
			installed and functioning. I
			estimate it should reduce the
			power drain to your systems by
			about forty percent.
			Any guess how long we'll have?
			Let just say... you don't want
			to waste any time once you get
			in there.
			You'll have to give him continuous
			readouts on energy consumption.
			I can't even predict if the drain
			will be at a constant rate.
			I understand.
			Then... that's it.
			I'll monitor you as far as I can,
			Commander. But once you get into
			that pocket -- you're on your own.
			Since we don't know the condition
			of the shuttle crew, I'll beam
			us all directly to sickbay.
			I'll notify Doctor Crusher to be
			standing by.
			La Forge to bridge...
			Picard here...
			We're ready to initiate shuttle
			prelaunch sequence.
			Proceed, Mister Data.
			Prelaunch sequence is underway.
			Request flight clearance.
			Clearance is granted.
			The shuttle is underway.
			Good hunting, Commander.
			Thank you, sir. See you for
			dinner.
			Heading three-five-five mark
			zero-one-two.
			Heading confirmed.
			Energy readings are normal, with
			power reserves stabilized at one
			hundred percent.
			Acknowledged.
			It's dead ahead, approximately
			fifty kilometers.
			Riker to Enterprise. We're going
			in.
			Riker to Enterprise...
			Riker to Enterprise...
			Power reserves are down to
			eighty-four percent.
			Look...
			Try hailing them...
			Calling the "Taris Murn... " Do
			you read me?
			I'm getting sensor readings.
			They're unconscious -- but they're
			alive.
			Stand by. I'm going to transport
			them over here.
			Power reserves at sixty-eight
			percent and dropping.
			The null space must be affecting
			the annular confinement beam...
			We used ten megajoules with that
			attempt. We're down to
			thirty-four percent of reserves.
			We can give it one more try. More
			than that and we won't have enough
			power to get ourselves out of
			here.
			They need medical attention
			quickly.
			Okay. Stand by to transport to
			the Enterprise.
			Here we go...
			Energy consumption?
			We're down to nine percent. Will,
			we don't have enough to get back.
			If we just sit here, we'll lose
			all our systems within an hour
			-- including life support.
			I'm rerouting the propulsion
			system to the transporter...
			Rechannel the navigation
			systems...
			Let's transfer every microjoule
			of energy we've got... sensors...
			life support... this might give
			us one last shot.
			An energy shift of that size...
			it'll overload the phase
			compensators... the shuttle --
			Will explode. But if we stay here
			we're dead, anyway.
			Maximum energy levels in five
			seconds...
			See you in a minute.
			Doctor... ?
			They've been oxygen-deprived...
			but I don't think there's any
			significant damage.
			Prepare some dexalin.
			Commander -- thank you.
			Your colleague Soren was a great
			help.
			Captain... if you would all join
			us this evening... we would like
			to express our gratitude...
			We'd be happy to.
			Noor will be eager to get a
			first-hand report. We should
			return to the surface.
			I will see you tonight then,
			Commander?
			There you are, Commander. I
			wondered what had happened to our
			guest of honor.
			Just getting some fresh air.
			I can take so much of these social
			functions... then I need to
			breathe a little.
			I would think you had attended
			so many affairs like this it would
			be second nature to you.
			I was raised in the outdoors.
			I'm never that comfortable in
			crowded rooms...
			What do you think of our planet?
			Isn't it beautiful?
			Yes. Quite beautiful.
			We have many varieties of plant
			life...
			Perhaps you would like to inspect
			some of them.
			Yes, I would. I've always been
			interested in exobotany.
			Please. Let me take you on a
			tour.
			Thank you. It's very kind of you.
			One of my favorites is this
			menellen tree. The leaves first
			turn pure white, and then blue
			when the weather gets cold...
			This is called a falla bush...
			it produces a fragrant flower on
			only one day of the year...
			Captain's log, stardate 45620.4.
			We remain in orbit of J'naii,
			charting the null pocket. We hope
			that a detailed map of the anomaly
			will prevent the loss of other
			ships.
			Come in.
			Hello, Will.
			What's all this?
			Wonderful things... my mother sent
			me a box that belonged to one of
			my father's ancestors. It had
			been stored on Earth years ago
			and just recently turned up.
			Do you know who these people are?
			No. A few of the pictures are
			marked with names... but most of
			them aren't. I look at all these
			faces... and wonder who they
			are... if they might be related
			to me...
			This one looks like you...
			Deanna... I've got something on my
			mind... and I had to see you...
			Has something happened?
			I've met someone... someone who's
			becoming important to me...
			Soren...
			Yes.
			You're my friend... so it seemed
			like...
			I'm not sure. It just seemed
			right to tell you.
			I'm glad you did.
			Nothing will change between us,
			will it?
			Of course it will. All
			relationships are constantly
			changing.
			But we will always be friends.
			Maybe even better friends.
			You're part of my life, and I'm
			part of yours. That much will
			always be true.
			Turns out the null pocket is even
			more irregular than we expected,
			Commander.
			Maybe its configuration is
			shifting.
			I don't think so... the
			measurements you took are holding.
			It just has more projections than
			we thought. It's going to take
			longer than we planned to get it
			mapped.
			I'm headed for the shuttle bay.
			We're fitting another shuttle to
			help in the survey.
			Have you made plans for dinner
			this evening?
			I have some paperwork to do...
			I thought I'd start on it...
			I'd like to discuss some of our
			suggestions for regulating travel
			around the null space. Maybe we
			could have an early dinner... so
			you could still get your work done
			afterwards.
			I'd like that.
			Nineteen hundred hours?
			That would be fine.
			Hello. I'm here to see Soren...
			I know.
			We had an appointment.
			To discuss plans for regulating
			the --
			I don't think so, Commander.
			Excuse me?
			We know about the two of you.
			We know what you're doing.
			Where's Soren?
			And we're going to make sure it
			doesn't happen again.
			Answer me -- where is Soren?
			Gone. In custody. And there's
			nothing you can do about it.
			The hell there isn't.
			You are aware of the charges
			against you?
			Yes.
			Do you intend to dispute them?
			Well? What is your response?
			Are you in charge here?
			Commander Riker -- these
			proceedings are closed to anyone
			but --
			I think I just opened them.
			Sir, this is a private matter.
			We are grateful for your recent
			help, but that gives you no right
			to interfere with our personal
			concerns --
			I want you to know what really
			happened. It's all my fault.
			I was attracted to Soren. I
			pursued... I insisted. I didn't
			understand your ways until Soren
			told me. And rejected me.
			Nothing happened between us.
			I ask your forgiveness. I
			behaved... inappropriately.
			Is this true?
			No.
			Soren --
			I am tired of lies.
			I am female. I was born that way.
			I have had those feelings...
			those longings... all my life.
			It is not unnatural. I am not
			sick because I feel this way.
			I do not need to be helped, and
			I do not need to be cured. What
			I do need -- what all of those
			like me need -- is your
			understanding and your compassion.
			We do not injure you in any way.
			And yet we are scorned, and
			attacked. And all because we are
			different.
			What we do is no different from
			what you do. We talk and laugh...
			we complain about work and we
			wonder about growing old... we
			talk about our families, and we
			worry about the future...
			We cry with each other when things
			seem hopeless.
			All the loving things that you
			do with each other... that's what
			we do. And for that, we are
			called misfits, and deviants...
			and criminals.
			What right do you have to punish
			us? What right do you have to
			change us? What makes you think
			you can dictate how people love
			each other?
			I congratulate you, Soren. Your
			decision to admit your perversion
			makes it much more likely that
			we can help you.
			No, wait... you don't have to do
			this...
			Commander?
			Let me take her away. She can
			come with me, we'll give her
			asylum on the Enterprise. You'll
			never have to see her again.
			That would solve the problem,
			wouldn't it? You'd be rid of
			her... she couldn't influence
			anyone else...
			Commander, after Soren's diatribe,
			you must think we are a cruel,
			repressive people. Nothing could
			be further from the truth.
			I'm just trying to find a solution
			that would satisfy everyone --
			In fact, we are a remarkably free
			and open society. Our people have
			rights and liberties which give
			them a great deal of
			self-determination. We are, by
			all measurements, an enlightened
			race.
			Then how is it... that Soren has
			no choice about her sexual
			orientation?
			We are concerned about our
			citizens. We take our obligations
			to them seriously. Soren is
			sick... and sick people need to
			get well.
			Did it ever occur to you she
			might prefer to stay the way she
			is?
			You don't understand. We have
			a very high success rate in
			treating deviants like this. And
			without exception -- they have
			become happier people after their
			treatment. And grateful... that
			we care enough to cure them.
			You see, Commander... on this
			world, everyone wants to be
			normal.
			She is --
			Take her to quarters. Treatment
			will begin tomorrow.
			Don't do this --
			Soren --
			No more, Commander.
			Enterprise. One to transport.
			I can't just leave her there.
			They'll give her these
			psychotectic treatments...
			I don't know what to do.
			I could talk to Noor. Perhaps
			there's a way to work this out
			--
			Sir, their minds are set. They
			don't want to hear another
			solution.
			Then I'm not sure there's much
			we can do.
			There has to be.
			My relationship with Soren isn't
			trivial... she's very important
			to me.
			It's my fault this has happened.
			And I have to help her.
			Will, if you've come here for
			sanction... to take matters into
			your own hands... I can't give
			it to you.
			I know that, sir. But I know
			I have to do something.
			Interfering in the internal
			matters of the J'naii is
			prohibited by the Prime
			Directive...
			I'm aware of that.
			If you violate it, you may be
			putting your career in jeopardy.
			Starfleet doesn't take these
			matters lightly... and I can't
			defend you if you go too far...
			Do you understand that?
			You've made yourself very clear,
			sir.
			Will... don't risk everything
			you've worked for...
			Thank you, sir. May I be excused
			now?
			Who is it?
			Lieutenant Worf.
			Come in.
			Commander, I have the plan for
			deploying warning buoys around
			the null space.
			Fine. Just leave it, I'll look
			at it later.
			Yes, sir.
			Thank you. You're dismissed.
			Commander... I am aware of what
			transpired on the planet's
			surface...
			Are you by any chance considering
			an... unannounced visit?
			I will go with you.
			Lieutenant --
			Sir... you are my commanding
			officer... and if you order me
			to stay on board, I will obey.
			But I ask you not to give that
			order. A warrior does not let
			a friend face danger alone.
			I suggest we change clothing
			first.
			The meeting is ending. I
			think they will bring her out of
			the building soon.
			Okay. They'll probably come
			down that path... we can take
			cover there --
			-- behind those rocks.
			Yes, Commander.
			She'll be under guard... no
			telling how many...
			I will handle the guards. You
			take her to cover.
			Something's happening...
			They're leaving.
			Could you excuse us? I have to
			talk to her...
			Wait...
			Don't worry... we'll be out of
			here in a minute...
			Will, please...
			We're almost there...
			You can't do this...
			I won't let them hurt you. You'll
			be safe on the Enterprise.
			Soren...
			I'm so sorry... it's my fault you
			got involved in all this...
			It's going to be all right...
			everything's going to be fine...
			No, it's not.
			What are you talking about?
			It was all a mistake. I should
			have realized it from the
			beginning...
			What... ?
			That I was sick. I had these
			terrible urges... that's why I
			reached out to you... but it was
			wrong. I see that now.
			I don't understand how I could
			have done... what I did.
			Maybe... maybe Doctor Crusher
			could treat you... bring you
			back... to the way you were
			before.
			Why would I want that?
			Soren... I love you.
			I'm sorry.
			How long to the Phelan system?
			At warp six, fifty-three hours,
			sir.
			Commander... ?
			Captain.
			Starfleet has just sent a message
			asking us to proceed to the Phelan
			system to negotiate a trade
			agreement.
			Yes, sir.
			I wasn't sure when to tell them
			we'd be underway.
			Is our business with the J'naii
			finished?
			Finished, sir.
			Very well. Ensign, take us out
			of orbit, set a course for the
			Phelan system. Warp six.
			Engage.
