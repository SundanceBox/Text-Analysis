			... and the hospital facility --
			-- will stand there, facing north,
			in that grove of trees.
			The school and the arts center
			will be here, centrally located
			among the residential pods.
			Looks good. At this rate you
			should be ready for the next wave
			of colonists in about six months.
			I have to say I envy you... this
			is a beautiful place to put down
			roots.
			Somehow, Commander... you don't
			strike me as the kind that puts
			down roots...
			No? How do I strike you?
			As... a free spirit. An
			adventurer.
			Ah. And aren't pioneers, like
			you, adventurers at heart?
			Of course. But we also have
			this... nesting instinct. It's
			exciting to find a new world --
			but the joy comes in making it
			a home. Building houses. Having
			children. Roots.
			Very interesting. I'd love to
			discuss this further with you.
			Dinner tonight?
			If you want to share camp rations
			in my tent -- I'd be delighted.
			Haven't we managed to get a
			replicator down here yet?
			No, we haven't... but I've been
			saving my ration of dried chicken
			curry. It should go very nicely
			with that bottle of wine I happen
			to know you brought with you...
			It's sounding better all the
			time...
			And as you know... I provide the
			most memorable desserts...
			My favorite part of dinner...
			Will... Carmen...
			We've been going over the
			schematics for the hospital. The
			location seems fine...
			When the Enterprise comes back
			tomorrow, we'll bring a crew
			down here and get started.
			Carmen... do you have some
			construction started I don't know
			about?
			No... what is that?
			Data?
			I do not recognize the sound.
			I believe the sound is coming from
			above...
			Will... what is it?
			Maybe an atmospheric
			disturbance...
			Data -- what's our best bet for
			cover?
			There are subterranean caverns
			beneath the hills to the east.
			Approximately one kilometer.
			Carmen, start rounding everybody
			up.
			But --
			We've seen it before -- we know
			what it is. Now get moving!
			Let's go!
			Beverly! This way!
			Okay, people... stay calm... let's
			go...
			Follow him! Follow him! Go!
			Let's go!
			This way! Stay together!
			Will... help us!
			Carmen!
			Captain... sensors are indicating
			a disturbance near the outpost
			on Melona Four.
			What kind of disturbance?
			I can't tell. We are still too
			far away. It could be an
			electrical storm...
			See if you can make contact with
			the colony...
			Aye, sir.
			How far are we?
			At current speed, twenty-seven
			hours.
			Captain, I get no response from
			Melona colony. But the
			disturbance in the atmosphere is
			increasing.
			Bridge to La Forge...
			La Forge here, Captain.
			Are you picking up readings from
			Melona?
			Yes, sir. Something strange is
			going on... there are violent
			disruptions in the atmosphere...
			Ensign... increase to warp eight.
			Inside... keep moving, deep into
			the cave...
			How much protection will this cave
			give us, Data?
			The presence of refractory metals
			in the rock formations may act
			as an effective barrier.
			Let's seal this entrance.
			I hope there's enough air in here.
			There should be a ventilation
			source somewhere...
			We need some light in here...
			How are the others?
			So far it looks like scrapes and
			bruises. Will... where's Carmen?
			Carmen didn't make it.
			She went back for someone... a
			man who'd fallen...
			I'm sorry.
			I think we'll be safe in here.
			I'm not sure about our air supply.
			Stay put and don't move around,
			don't expend unnecessary energy.
			With any luck we can wait this
			out.
			Riker to Enterprise... Riker to
			Enterprise...
			Commander, the refractory metals
			in the rock strata might also
			interfere with communication.
			Data... we've only seen the
			Crystalline Entity once before...
			how do you know these metals will
			protect us?
			I am not entirely certain they
			will.
			That's what I was afraid you were
			going to say...
			Sir... the disturbance on Melona
			is becoming more intense.
			Continue hailing the colony.
			All channels.
			Captain... the fact that they're
			not responding doesn't necessarily
			mean there's anything wrong. The
			atmospheric disturbance could be
			jamming the signal.
			I know, Counselor.
			Still no response, sir.
			Ensign, increase to warp nine.
			How long, Mister Worf?
			Six hours.
			Commander... I have one man
			unconscious. We can't stay in
			here much longer...
			If I open that entrance and it's
			still out there, we're dead.
			If we stay here we'll be dead...
			It has been over an hour since
			we heard the Entity. It may be
			gone.
			And it may be out there waiting
			for us.
			Everybody stay back.
			Commander?
			Lieutenant Worf... I don't think
			I've ever seen a more beautiful
			sight.
			Good to see you're all right,
			Commander. What's happened here?
			The Crystalline Entity paid us
			a visit. We lost two colonists
			but got the rest in here...
			Captain's log, stardate 45122.3.
			We have notified Starfleet Command
			of our intention to pursue and
			investigate the Crystalline
			Entity. To that end, we have been
			joined...
			... by Doctor Kila Marr, a
			xenologist who has made studying
			the Entity her life's work.
			Welcome to the Enterprise. I am
			Commander William Riker.
			Commander... Kila Marr.
			We're glad you're here.
			You were on the surface... during
			the attack.
			That's right.
			Remarkable. You and your group
			are the only beings ever known
			to survive an assault by the
			Crystalline Entity.
			We were lucky.
			I should say.
			And... your android. He was
			there, too?
			Lieutenant Commander Data was
			there, yes.
			Well. Shall we get started?
			I'd be happy to show you to your
			quarters --
			Commander, the chance to talk to
			survivors... this soon after an
			attack... I've been waiting years
			for this. I don't want to waste
			a moment more.
			... and when we came out of the
			cave... there was nothing left.
			Everywhere we looked... there was
			just complete devastation... trees
			gone... nothing...
			That's typical. It could take
			years for anything to grow again.
			Doctor, I ran a full
			spectrographic analysis, section
			by section. Trace elements
			confirm that it was the same
			entity which destroyed the colony
			on Omicron Theta.
			The Crystalline Entity seems to
			function like a giant
			electromagnetic collector. It
			needs a lot of power to keep
			going... so it strips every form
			of life from the worlds it
			encounters and converts it all
			into energy.
			There was no vegetation left...
			no insects. Not even soil
			bacteria. It left nothing.
			Except witnesses. For the first
			time in eleven recorded attacks.
			Why, I wonder... did it spare your
			group?
			It didn't spare everyone, Doctor.
			If you'll check your reports,
			you'll find that two of the
			colonists didn't survive.
			My point is that until now there
			have never been any survivors.
			Doctor, the cave in which we hid
			was carved from rock which
			possessed heavy concentrations
			of kelbonite and fistrium. We
			surmise that the Entity could not
			penetrate that barrier.
			I'd like to do interviews with
			each of the survivors. Collect
			as much specific detail as I can
			of their observations.
			Of course.
			And I want to inspect the remains
			of Melona Colony as soon as
			possible.
			Commander Data, you will accompany
			the Doctor to the surface.
			Yes, sir. We can leave --
			If you don't mind, Captain, I'd
			prefer to choose my own team.
			There is no one on this ship who
			is more knowledgeable of the
			Crystalline Entity than Commander
			Data. His birthplace was Omicron
			Theta.
			I am aware of his origins. I am
			very much aware that his
			"brother," Lore, worked with the
			Crystalline Entity, and led it
			to Omicron Theta -- where it
			killed every living thing.
			I don't think it's unreasonable
			that I would prefer to make
			another choice.
			If there are others you wish to
			have on your team, you are, of
			course, welcome to request their
			additional presence.
			But as captain, I think it is in
			the best interest of this
			investigation for you and
			Commander Data to work together.
			As you wish, Captain.
			Well?
			I don't think you need an empath
			to sense that woman's feelings.
			There's hostility... that she
			seems to have transferred from
			Lore... to Data...
			Perhaps you shouldn't have forced
			her together with Data so soon.
			If her discomfort is going to
			cloud her judgement... or preclude
			her doing her objective best...
			I want to find it out now.
			Doctor, there is evidence of
			residual bitrious matter in the
			soil. It was not present before
			the Entity's attack.
			Doctor Marr... you have made it
			quite clear that you are disturbed
			by my presence. However, I do
			not believe that we can accomplish
			the task we have been assigned
			if you continue to ignore me.
			Commander... I hear everything
			you say to me. If there is
			anything worth my response, you
			can be sure I will not be silent.
			Then I do not understand your lack
			of interest in the bitrious
			filaments I mentioned.
			It's old news to me. I found
			evidence of bitrium in three
			separate attack sites. It seems
			to be a residual element the
			Entity produces after it absorbs
			living matter.
			I'm actually more interested in
			this cave.
			I'm still amazed that your group
			was spared.
			As I have speculated, the presence
			of refractory --
			-- refractory metals. Yes, I
			know.
			On two other occasions settlers
			sought refuge in caves. Some of
			them deeper underground than this
			one. They perished anyway.
			Were those caves laced with
			kelbonite or fistrium?
			The tunnels on Forlat Three had
			strong deposits of kelbonite, yes.
			Then perhaps it is the combination
			of the two metals which prevented
			the Entity --
			Or maybe it was you.
			I do not understand.
			Maybe it was your presence which
			made the Crystalline Entity pass
			over the people in this cave.
			Did that occur to you?
			I cannot imagine what effect my
			being here would have had --
			If you had been in contact with
			the Entity... if that's why Melona
			was attacked... it surely wouldn't
			have killed its -- ally.
			You are suggesting I lured it
			here?
			Did you?
			No, Doctor.
			Ah. Because Lore betrayed the
			colonists on Omicron Theta, you
			assume that I am capable of the
			same behavior. But you are
			mistaken, Doctor. My programming
			is distinctly different from
			Lore's.
			Don't you understand? I'm
			accusing you of collaborating with
			that monster...
			I do understand. I am attempting
			to explain to you that it is
			impossible.
			Amazing. You can't feel anything,
			can you? Nothing I say to you
			hurts you...
			That is true.
			I'm getting a slight elevation
			of monocaladium particulates in
			this cave wall... are you making
			note of that?
			Yes, Doctor.
			My son died on Omicron Theta.
			He was sixteen when the colony
			was attacked.
			That's the reason I became an
			expert on the Crystalline Entity.
			I've spent my life, studying it,
			tracking it... hoping someday to
			find it...
			And if I learn that you are
			helping that thing in any way
			whatsoever... I'll see to it
			that you are disassembled --
			piece by piece.
			Okay... we've input all the data
			you collected on the surface...
			Just a minute, Commander... I have
			some cellulose readings from soil
			samples that weren't included...
			You handle that unit like a
			veteran, Doctor.
			One thing about spending your life
			gathering information... you learn
			your way around computers.
			Hydrocarbons slightly elevated...
			bitrious filaments in trace
			amounts...
			Lanthanides... nitrates... all
			normal.
			Nothing different. Everything
			falls within the parameters I've
			established at the other attack
			sites.
			Did you expect different results
			this time, Doctor?
			I've never surveyed a site so soon
			after the attack. I thought maybe
			I'd find something new. Something
			that would make a difference...
			Doctor... have you ever scanned
			your samples for gamma radiation?
			Why would I do that?
			We are seeing high-energy
			reactions that may show up in a
			gamma scan...
			... and if they do... we might find
			a pattern -- a kind of marker the
			Entity left behind. Good idea,
			Data.
			Frankly, I just don't see what
			this will get us.
			If the Entity left a residual
			trace of antiprotons in the
			samples we collected, the gamma
			radiation scan would reveal that.
			Data, I'm getting the readout now.
			If we try a logarithmic scale,
			it will give us better resolution.
			There, Data... see it?
			Yes.
			Would you care to see what the
			scan has produced, Doctor?
			A sharp spike at ten KEV. And
			another...
			A pattern...
			So we know the Entity leaves
			antiprotons behind...
			If it also deposits antiprotons
			in space, as it travels... could
			we detect them?
			Sure. The ship's lateral sensors
			can be set for gamma radiation.
			Well. Let's get to it, shall we?
			It seems I owe you thanks,
			Commander.
			The thanks actually go to Doctor
			Clendenning on Omicron Theta who
			did the first experiments with
			gamma scans.
			I've never read that... it wasn't
			in any of his records...
			That is correct. But I possess
			much of his knowledge. He was
			working with new detectors before
			the attack on Omicron Theta.
			I'd heard that you had been
			programmed with the experiences
			of the colonists... but frankly
			it's a little hard to believe.
			Bridge.
			It is true, Doctor. The contents
			of their journals and logs were
			transferred into my memory cells.
			The man who created me also
			experimented with scanning the
			synaptic patterns of the
			colonists' temporal lobes and
			programming them into my neural
			nets.
			You possess -- their thoughts?
			To some degree. Doctor Soong
			hoped to provide me with an
			amalgam of the colonists'
			memories.
			Interesting.
			There... a spike at ten KEV...
			and again...
			That's the same pattern we saw
			in engineering.
			Can you project a course from it?
			Yes, sir.
			There are two possible
			destinations. The Brechtian
			Cluster and the Argos system.
			Is either populated?
			The Brechtian Cluster has two
			inhabited planets.
			Ensign, set a course.
			Captain, I've done some
			preliminary estimates of the
			firing pattern we'll need in order
			to destroy the Entity. The photon
			torpedoes will require some
			reprogramming.
			With your permission, I'll give
			the calculations to Lieutenant
			Worf.
			Reprogram the torpedoes, Mister
			Worf.
			Let's just hope we don't have to
			use them.
			I beg your pardon?
			If it's possible to avoid firing
			on it, I would hope that --
			You aren't going to kill it?
			Perhaps you should join me in my
			ready room.
			I don't understand. Why are we
			pursuing the Entity, if not to
			destroy it?
			We are not hunters, Doctor. Nor
			is it our role to exact revenge.
			What do you propose? We track
			it down... greet it warmly... and
			ask if it would mind terribly not
			ravaging any more planets?
			I'm not denying that it might
			become necessary to fire on it.
			But that would be a last resort.
			Why? Why not just kill it?
			I'm going to try to talk to it.
			What?
			We know through our own experience
			that our shields will protect us
			from the Entity. As long as we
			are in no danger, I will make
			every effort to communicate.
			To what end?
			If we can determine what its needs
			are, we might find other sources
			to supply it...
			Its needs are to slaughter people
			by the thousands... it's nothing
			but a giant killing machine.
			The sperm whale on Earth devours
			millions of cuttlefish as it
			prowls the ocean. It is not
			evil... it is simply feeding.
			The same may well be true of the
			Crystalline Entity.
			That would be small comfort to
			those who have died to feed it.
			We're not talking about
			cuttlefish... we're talking
			about people.
			There are those, Doctor, who would
			argue that the Crystalline Entity
			has as much right to be here as
			we do.
			Mister Data has some theories
			about how to communicate with the
			Entity. Please confer with him.
			Come in.
			Am I disturbing you?
			Not at all, Doctor.
			Commander... there's something
			I want to say.
			You have been helpful to me, and
			kind. I repaid you with
			accusations -- and I realize I
			may have been wrong.
			It is gracious of you to say,
			Doctor. But I have not been
			injured by you.
			Captain Picard has told me that
			you have done work in trying to
			establish communication with the
			Entity.
			That is true. I have experimented
			with producing vibrations in
			crystal by means of graviton
			pulses.
			Like tapping a crystal goblet?
			Exactly.
			I will call up the results I have
			achieved so far and you can study
			them.
			All right.
			Commander... just what kind of
			memories do you retain... of the
			colonists?
			I do not possess the
			minute-to-minute remembrances of
			each person there... although
			many of their more intense
			recollections are contained in
			my memory banks.
			Do you... have any of my son's
			memories?
			Marr... Raymond... called Renny.
			Yes. I do.
			I see. And his journals?
			Yes.
			I was wondering... do you know...
			... did he -- blame me?
			Blame you?
			For going away. For leaving him
			on Omicron Theta.
			I am not aware of any blame
			against you.
			I left him with friends... I chose
			to pursue my career... I planned
			to go back, but things kept
			interfering... I kept thinking,
			"I'll go next month... "
			And then... there weren't any more
			"next months."
			I am unaware of any negative
			thoughts he had about you.
			His personal journals indicated
			he was proud... that you were such
			a fine scientist.
			He was... ?
			What else... do you know... ?
			Commander Data, Doctor Marr,
			report to the bridge immediately.
			A distress call... from a ship
			called the Kallisko... it's being
			pursued by an unknown object.
			... sensors indicate a crystalline
			structure of indeterminate mass...
			How strong are your shields,
			Captain?
			We are a transport ship -- our
			shields are minimal...
			Do you carry weapons?
			Only low-level particle phasers...
			Do you know what this being is?
			Kallisko, change course, take
			evasive action. Do whatever you
			can to outrun it.
			... we are under attack.
			... notify our people on Boreal
			Three --
			Mister Worf... can you
			reestablish?
			No, Captain. There is no
			response.
			The Crystalline Entity is moving
			away.
			Set a course for the Kallisko.
			Mister Riker, prepare an away
			team... I want you to check for
			survivors.
			It was pretty much what we
			expected, Captain. No
			survivors...
			Not a trace of anything that was
			ever alive. Not even the seeds
			in their greenery storage.
			Warp and impulse engines are down
			but they can be restarted. A
			skeleton crew could take the ship
			to a starbase.
			We don't want to take the time
			now. Send a message to the
			nearest starbase to dispatch a
			crew.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister La Forge, make certain we
			are still picking up the gamma
			radiation pattern of the Entity.
			Yes, sir.
			Have you and Commander Data made
			any progress in finding a means
			of communication?
			I believe so. There are some
			details to iron out --
			Then please keep working. We
			may need it soon.
			Deck seventeen.
			Doctor... you have seemed
			preoccupied... since we surveyed
			the Kallisko.
			I've found you very easy to talk
			to, Commander.
			Do you mind if I tell you
			something... ?
			Not at all.
			Hearing the screams of those
			men... made it hard not to think
			about my son... about what
			happened to him.
			I've read stories... about
			soldiers on the battlefield...
			wounded and dying... who call for
			their mothers.
			And I've always wondered...
			... if my son called for me...
			... if he died wondering why I
			didn't come to him...
			Come.
			It's still headed toward the
			Brechtian Cluster. We've
			reestablished our course.
			Very well.
			One more thing...
			Starfleet will notify Carmen
			Davila's family of her death and
			return her personal effects.
			Would you care to include a
			letter?
			Yes, sir. I'd like that.
			Something more, Number One?
			Permission to speak freely, sir?
			Of course.
			I've been thinking... maybe Doctor
			Marr is right. Maybe we should
			destroy the Entity.
			And why do you think that?
			It's killed thousands. It will
			undoubtedly keep on killing...
			unless we stop it. I don't want
			those deaths on my conscience.
			Are you sure that's it? Or are
			you being influenced by personal
			feelings?
			With all due respect, sir... I'm
			not a raw cadet. I've lost people
			on missions before.
			Carmen was a good friend. But
			that's not why I'm saying this.
			If we take the time to try to
			communicate with this thing, we
			may lose our chance to destroy
			it. And I don't think we can risk
			that.
			I'm going to write that letter
			to Carmen's family.
			We should program the bridge
			science station to vary the
			emissions we direct toward the
			Entity.
			I'll write a subroutine that will
			allow us to change the frequency
			of the graviton beam.
			Data... you told me you carried
			some of my son's memories...
			That is true.
			What can you tell me about Renny?
			What were those thoughts? Was
			he -- was he happy at all, on
			Omicron Theta?
			I possess some vivid memories of
			sporting events... he played
			Parrises Squares with a group of
			his schoolmates...
			Renny started Parrises Squares
			when he was young... too young,
			really... but the older children
			kept asking him to join in and
			I couldn't keep him away. He just
			had this natural gift...
			He was pleased to have won a
			championship emblem.
			I remember... he wrote me about
			that... he was so proud...
			I'm characterizing pulse width
			in nanoseconds... sound right to
			you?
			Yes, Doctor.
			Your son's most intense thoughts
			seemed to revolve around a young
			woman named Janina...
			A girlfriend? I never knew about
			that... of course, that would be
			the last thing he'd tell his
			mother... What was she like?
			He enjoyed her... gentleness...
			her kindness... her...
			... her -- physical attributes...
			There. Now we'll be able to vary
			all the parameters directly from
			the bridge.
			Could you... do something for me?
			It would mean a lot...
			I would be happy to be of help.
			You see... all I have left of
			Renny, my only connection to
			him... is there, inside you.
			And I was wondering... if you
			could talk to me in his voice.
			I know you have the ability to
			sound like other people. Isn't
			that right?
			Yes, that is correct. But what
			would you want me to say?
			Maybe... something from his
			journals...
			Many of his journal entries took
			the form of letters to his
			friends and family. I could
			access one of those.
			I took my last exam today... I
			think I did all right on
			everything except cellular
			biology. I know you think it's
			important, Mom... but I don't see
			how I'm ever gonna use this stuff.
			In a couple of weeks, a bunch of
			us are going on an archaeological
			dig in the mountains. The Wallaces
			said it would be okay with them
			as long as we have adult
			supervision... so don't worry
			-- they're watching out for me.
			They're really great people...
			I like them a lot.
			But they're kind of serious...
			They don't have your sense of
			humor, Mom.
			I miss you.
			Captain's Log, stardate 45125.7.
			We are still in pursuit of the
			Crystalline Entity. Data and
			Doctor Marr are prepared to
			attempt communication with the
			being when we intercept it. I
			will admit to some uncertainty
			about the prospect... it could
			prove to be a scientific
			triumph... or a catastrophe.
			Sir, the Brechtian Cluster is now
			five light years away.
			Are we still picking up the
			Entity's pattern?
			Yes, Commander. But sensors do
			not yet have a lock on its exact
			whereabouts.
			Captain, we are reasonably certain
			it's between here and the
			Brechtian Cluster. If I start
			emitting the graviton beam now,
			it may act as a lure... a kind
			of beacon.
			Make it so.
			We'll start with a pulse width
			of five nanoseconds, frequency
			one pulse per second.
			Commencing graviton emission
			now...
			No change in the sensor readings.
			Let's ramp the frequency.
			Emissions now at ten pulses per
			second.
			Sir...
			What is it? Do you have
			something?
			A large mass... approaching at
			warp speed...
			Full stop. Doctor Marr, continue
			emitting your signal. On screen,
			Mister Worf.
			Shields up.
			It's beautiful...
			Doctor... shall we change the
			frequency?
			Yes... yes, Commander. Proceed.
			Changing to twenty pulses per
			second...
			What's it doing? Checking us out?
			Possibly... just as we are
			checking it out.
			Is it... responding to us?
			Let's test that. Ramp the
			frequency again, Commander...
			Emissions at thirty pulses per
			second...
			Captain, I'm reading a
			transmission from the Entity...
			a series of graviton pulses...
			It's working... that's a response
			to our signal...
			Remarkable...
			Captain, there is a pattern
			emerging from its signals.
			It's trying to communicate with
			us?
			I believe so... although it will
			take some time to decipher the
			patterns...
			Then it's possible...
			communication... understanding...
			Let me try something else... a
			continuous graviton beam.
			Graviton pulses from the Entity
			have stopped...
			Maybe it doesn't like what we're
			doing...
			Return to the intermittent
			signal, Doctor...
			Doctor Marr?
			Counselor... ?
			Something's wrong...
			Sir, the Entity is beginning to
			resonate... vibrations
			increasing rapidly...
			Doctor, stop the transmission!
			That is an order --
			It's for you, Renny... I did it
			for you...
			Mister Worf, take charge of the
			Doctor. Mister Data, shut down
			that transmission.
			Vibration amplitude is
			increasing... it can't last much
			longer.
			I am unable to stop our graviton
			signal, Captain. Doctor Marr
			has isolated the access code.
			Maybe I can create an override
			sequence... shut it down from
			here.
			Resonance is approaching
			critical...
			I can override her program, but
			it's gonna take time --
			Mister Worf... escort Doctor Marr
			to her quarters.
			Yes, sir.
			It will never hurt anyone again...
			Captain... perhaps I should escort
			Doctor Marr...
			Fine. But do not leave her
			unattended.
			Doctor... if you will come with
			me...
			Of course.
			I will stay with you, Doctor.
			How long will you live, Data?
			There has been no predetermined
			limit placed on my existence.
			I'm glad. As long as you're
			alive... he'll be alive.
			I need your help.
			In what way, Doctor?
			... like you did before... tell me
			you understand, Renny... that you
			know I did it for you, because
			I love you... because I wanted
			to give you peace, at last.
			I do not find such a file in your
			son's journals. However... from
			what I know of him by his writing
			and his memories, I do not believe
			he would be happy. He was proud
			of your career as a scientist,
			and now you have destroyed it.
			You say you did it for him, but
			he would not want that. Yes.
			He would be very sad now.
			Does that help, Doctor Marr?
