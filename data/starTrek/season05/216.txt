			Captain's log, stardate 45587.3.
			We are picking up a consignment
			of chlorinide from Starbase
			Twenty-seven for transportation
			to the Mylaira system. Once we
			have delivered this material, we
			will investigate reported subspace
			anomalies in the Kelnaria region.
			No question. She was bluffing.
			Bluffing is not one of Counselor
			Troi's strong suits.
			I'm still reading some chlorinide
			leakage, but I can't pin it down.
			Maybe over there...
			It would have been unwise to
			call. My hand was not strong
			enough.
			You had jacks and eights and
			she bluffed you with a pair of
			sixes.
			Sixes!
			How do you know what I had?
			Let's just say... I had a special
			insight into your cards.
			Hey, next time bring a deck that's
			not transparent to infrared
			light.
			Don't worry, I only peek after
			the hand is over.
			Still nothing. Well... I'll get
			a dynoscanner and try again.
			Worf!
			La Forge to sickbay! Medical
			emergency in cargo bay three!
			What... happened?
			The containers you were checking
			fell on you. You're lucky to be
			alive.
			I will not attempt to leave
			sickbay without your approval,
			Doctor. The restraining field
			is not necessary.
			Worf... there is no restraining
			field.
			But I cannot move my legs.
			I know.
			You can't move because one of the
			containers shattered seven of your
			vertebrae... and crushed your
			spinal cord.
			I'm afraid... there's no way to
			repair this kind of injury.
			I know what you're trying to do
			and I understand why. But it's
			important that you remain in bed.
			Klingons do not... lie in bed.
			They do if they have extensive
			internal injuries which need time
			to heal.
			The muscles in my legs will
			atrophy unless they are used.
			A vigorous program of exercise
			will be necessary for a full
			recovery.
			I understand that as a Klingon
			this is difficult for you... but
			you have to face your situation
			as it really is... not as you want
			it to be.
			I've sent for a neurogeneticist,
			but... you need to realize that
			you'll probably never regain total
			use of your legs.
			Leave me.
			Your son has been asking to see
			you.
			No. I will not have him see me
			like this.
			All right.
			Bridge to Doctor Crusher. The
			Potemkin has arrived and Doctor
			Russell is ready to transport
			aboard.
			I'm on my way.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
			Doctor Russell. I'm Beverly
			Crusher.
			A pleasure.
			I have some equipment aboard the
			Potemkin. Please have it sent
			to one of your medical labs.
			Send it to medlab four.
			Before we get down to business,
			I just wanted to say that I had
			the pleasure of reading your paper
			on cybernetic regeneration
			recently.
			Really? You're the first person
			to mention it.
			Oh, I thought it was brilliant.
			Your ideas on bioactive interfaces
			border on revolutionary. It's going
			to be a genuine pleasure working
			with you.
			Thank you.
			Have you had a chance to review
			Worf's case history yet?
			Only briefly. I must admit, I
			was a little shocked to find the
			state of Klingon neurological
			medicine to be so... primitive.
			It's a cultural bias. When I
			contacted the Klingon Medical
			Division, I was told they usually
			let the patient die in a case like
			this... as a result they've done
			almost no research on
			neurological trauma.
			We'll be in uncharted waters.
			Worf's been having a hard time
			dealing with his injuries. He's
			always been a difficult patient,
			but now...
			He's a little tough to get along
			with at first, but I think you'll
			get to like him after---
			Doctor.
			I know that as a starship doctor,
			you have to maintain close ties
			with patients. But I think it
			would be best if I maintain a
			discreet distance. That way, I
			can give you a completely
			objective opinion regarding
			treatment.
			Yes... you're probably right.
			Good. Well... I believe you said
			I'll be working in medlab four?
			Yes. This way.
			You look pretty good for someone
			who's been eating sickbay food
			for three days.
			Please sit down, Commander.
			Thank you for agreeing to see me
			in... this condition.
			Worf, I'm not Klingon... I don't
			think there's any shame in being
			injured.
			I am not merely injured... Doctor
			Crusher believes my... paralysis
			will be permanent.
			I'm... sorry.
			I have a personal favor to ask.
			Name it.
			I want you to assist me in
			performing the... Hegh'bat
			ceremony.
			I want you to help me die.
			What?
			When a Klingon can no longer stand
			and face his enemies as a
			warrior... when he becomes a
			burden to his family and
			friends... it is time for the
			Hegh'bat... time for him to die.
			Worf, there have to be other
			options.
			No, there are not.
			I will not live as an object of...
			pity... or shame. My life as a
			Klingon is over.
			I won't help a friend commit
			suicide.
			We have served together for many
			years... fought side by side...
			I know you to be a brave and
			honorable man... if you truly
			consider me your friend... help
			me now... help me end my life as
			I lived it... with dignity and
			honor.
			Please.
			The cortico-spinal tract has
			continued to deteriorate over the
			past seventy-two hours despite
			CPK enzymatic therapy.
			What about alkysine treatment?
			Ineffective.
			Overdesigned.
			Klingon anatomy... twenty-three
			ribs, two livers, eight-chambered
			heart, double-lined neural pia
			mater... I've never seen so many
			unnecessary redundancies in one
			body.
			Klingon medicine refers to it as
			the brak'lul... almost every vital
			function in their bodies has a
			built-in redundancy in case the
			primary organ or system fails.
			It's a good design in theory, but
			in practice, all the extra organs
			mean there's just that much more
			that can go wrong.
			Let me show you something.
			We've been experimenting with
			DNA-based generators... this is
			a genetronic replicator. It reads
			the DNA coding of damaged organs,
			translates that into a specific
			set of replicant instructions and
			then begins to "grow" a
			replacement.
			I've read some of the preliminary
			work you've done... I thought this
			was still in the experimental
			stage.
			The early results have been very
			encouraging...
			Beverly, the genetronic replicator
			can create a completely new neural
			conduit for your Lieutenant Worf.
			Replace his entire spinal column?
			Exactly. Instead of splicing and
			pasting together broken
			connections like a couple of
			glorified tailors, we create a
			new, living system.
			I had no idea you were already
			using this on humanoids...
			I haven't been. This'll be the
			first time.
			First time?
			I've done dozens of holosimulations...
			the success rate is up to 
			thirty-seven percent...
			Thirty-seven percent... even a
			holographic patient would balk
			at those odds.
			Sooner or later it has to be tried
			on a living patient.
			We're talking about a spinal
			column. Even to attempt it,
			you'd have to remove his
			existing spine. We don't know
			enough about Klingon neurological
			medicine to reattach it. If
			something goes wrong, he'll die.
			I agree it has remarkable
			potential but it's still in the
			most preliminary stages of research.
			We can't possibly justify the risk
			to Worf. I'm afraid we'll just
			have to make do with the more
			conventional approaches.
			You're probably right. It's too
			radical an approach.
			Doctor Crusher, please report to
			the bridge.
			On my way.
			Doctor, the transport ship Denver
			has struck a gravitic mine left
			over from the Cardassian war.
			They've sustained heavy damage.
			Their last message said they were
			attempting to crash land on one
			of the planets in the Mericor
			system. We should arrive in just
			under seven hours.
			How many people were aboard?
			The Denver's standard crew
			complement is twenty-three, but
			they were transporting five
			hundred seventeen colonists to
			the Beloti sector.
			I'll need to convert all three
			shuttlebays to emergency triage
			centers. I also want all
			civilians with medical training
			to report for duty.
			Make it so.
			Captain, may I speak with you in
			private?
			Certainly, Number One. Mister
			Data, you have the bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			I've always tried to keep an open
			mind... not to judge someone
			else's culture by my own... but
			for me to be a part of this
			"ceremony"...
			I understand that Doctor Crusher
			believes he will never regain the
			use of his legs.
			That doesn't mean his life is
			over.
			That's a very... Human
			perspective, Will. But to any
			Klingon in Worf's position...
			life is over.
			I can't accept that.
			If you were dying... terminally
			ill from a disease for which there
			was no cure... and the few
			remaining days of your life would
			be spent in pain. Don't you think
			that you might come to see death
			as... a release?
			Worf isn't dying and he's not in
			pain... he can live a long life
			without---
			You or I could learn to live with
			a disability of this kind. But
			to Worf... his life ended when
			those containers fell on him.
			We don't have to agree with it...
			we don't have to understand it...
			but we do have to respect his
			beliefs.
			I can respect his beliefs, but
			Worf wants me to take an active
			role in ending his life.
			He asked for your help because
			you're his friend. That means
			that you'll have to make your
			decision based on that friendship.
			Which leaves me right back where
			I started.
			I'm sorry, Will. I can't make this
			decision for you... but I can tell
			you that Klingons choose their
			friends with great care. If Worf
			didn't feel he could count on
			you... he never would have asked.
			Why won't you let me see him?
			Alexander, I told you it's not
			my decision. Your father doesn't
			want to---
			I don't believe you. My father
			wants to see me. You're the one
			keeping me away from him!
			I think you know that's not true.
			Then why can't I see him?
			Your father is going through a
			very difficult time. He needs
			to be alone for now.
			But why?
			He's been injured, Alexander, and
			he's... embarrassed. To have
			anyone see him now would make him
			feel worse... even if it were
			you.
			This is part of that Klingon
			stuff, isn't it?
			My mother always said that
			Klingons had a lot of dumb ideas
			about honor.
			Alexander, that... "Klingon stuff"
			is very important to your father.
			Well, it isn't very important to
			me. I don't care about being
			Klingon, I just want to see my
			father.
			It's been a long day... why don't
			you get ready for bed and we'll
			talk about this again in the
			morning.
			Alexander is scared... confused...
			hurt... and all because his father
			is refusing to see him.
			You know why I left those
			instructions.
			Yes I do. It's not the "Klingon"
			way, right?
			It is a question of honor, and
			I would ask you to respect my
			wishes in this matter, Counselor.
			All I care about at this moment
			is a little boy who's terrified
			he's going to lose his father.
			Maybe it's time you stopped lying
			around here worrying about your
			honor... and began thinking about
			someone else... like your son.
			Would you like us to come back
			later?
			No. Come in, Doctor.
			This is Doctor Toby Russell from
			the Adelman Neurological Institute.
			She specializes in spinal injuries
			like yours.
			Doctor.
			Lieutenant. Doctor Crusher has
			been updating me on your case.
			We'd like to talk to you about
			some of your options.
			Please proceed.
			We've discussed a variety of
			surgical procedures... I'm afraid
			none of them would be able to
			repair the spinal cord. But we
			do have a way for you to regain
			most of your mobility.
			We can implant a series of neural
			transducers in your lower torso
			and legs. They're designed to
			pick up the electrical impulses
			from your brain and then stimulate
			the corresponding muscles. With
			a little work, you'll eventually
			regain sixty to seventy percent
			of your motor control.
			The first step would be to fit
			your legs with motor assist units
			like these.
			They're a training device... once
			you've mastered using them, we
			can move on to the implants. Now,
			try to move your leg.
			That's good for a first try.
			It'll take some time before you
			get used to manipulating the---
			No.
			I will not live like that.
			These are very sophisticated
			devices. With enough time, they
			will give you--
			Sixty percent of my mobility.
			I will not be seen... lurching
			through corridors like some
			half-Klingon machine... an object
			of ridicule and disgust.
			I understand how you feel... and
			I know that right now, this all
			sounds a little frightening...
			but I think it's important that
			you take your time before making
			a decision. All I ask is that
			you give this some thought.
			There is one other option I'd like
			you to consider... it's called
			genetronic replication....
			It's still in the experimental
			stage... but if it works, it will
			return virtually all of your
			mobility... and without the need
			for artificial implants.
			I thought we had discussed
			genetronics.
			We did.
			And I also thought we had decided
			against recommending it.
			You heard him... he'd rather die
			than live with the implants. I
			just gave him a better option than
			suicide.
			He's grasping at straws and you're
			giving him one. Now, instead of
			dealing with his paralysis, he's
			going to be thinking about this
			miracle cure of yours.
			There's a real chance this could
			work. And if it does, it'll be
			a major breakthrough in
			neurogenetics that will change
			a lot of people's lives.
			You're using the desperation of
			an injured man as an excuse to
			try a procedure you couldn't do
			under normal circumstances. I
			checked with Starfleet Medical
			and they've refused your requests
			to test genetronics on humanoids
			three times already.
			Are you really going to hide
			behind the rules of some
			bureaucracy? Your patient's life
			is at stake here.
			Picard to Doctor Crusher.
			Go ahead, Captain.
			We've located the survivors from
			the Denver.
			We're ready down here. I have
			triage teams standing by.
			Very well. We'll begin
			transporting the casualties aboard
			immediately. Bridge out.
			Could you use an extra pair of
			hands?
			Absolutely.
			Father?
			Come in, Alexander.
			Deanna said you hurt your back...
			that you couldn't walk.
			I am... still struggling with my
			injury.
			I was worried about you.
			We have much to talk about,
			Alexander. There will be
			difficult times ahead... you must
			be strong.
			I understand.
			Good.
			As Klingons, we must always be
			prepared for any---
			Father!
			Take him away.
			Worf, let me help you---
			Leave!
			Go on, Alexander. It'll be all
			right. I'll take care of your
			father.
			What happened here?
			He went into neural metaphasic
			shock.
			From leporazine? That's unusual.
			He couldn't take leporazine, his
			blood pressure was too low. So
			I had to try a different treament.
			A morathial series?
			No. I tried a new rybotherapy
			I've been working with. It's
			called Borathium, and I've had
			some very good results...
			You used this man for one of your
			experiments?
			Borathium is decades ahead of
			leporazine or morathial.
			Morathial would have saved his
			life.
			His injuries were so severe I
			don't think any conventional
			treatment could've saved him.
			The point is, you didn't even try
			the standard treatments.
			I made the choice I thought gave
			him the best chance of surviving.
			Isn't that what you would have
			done?
			I think you took advantage of the
			situation in order to test one
			of your theories -- just like
			you're trying to do with Worf.
			That's what this is really about,
			isn't it? Lieutenant Worf. I'm
			offering him the chance to recover
			fully -- a chance you can't give
			him.
			What this is about is the kind
			of medicine you seem to practice.
			I make no excuses about my
			approach to medicine. I don't like
			losing a patient any more than you
			do. But I'm looking down a long
			road, Doctor... this man didn't
			die for nothing -- the data I
			gathered was invaluable... it will
			eventually help save thousands
			of lives.
			I doubt that will comfort his
			family.
			Let me ask you this: if, some
			years from now, Borathium therapy
			were to save the life of someone
			you loved... would you still
			condemn me?
			I won't get drawn into a
			hypothetical argument, Doctor.
			Your research on this ship is
			over. You're relieved from all
			medical duties until further
			notice. Is that clear?
			Perfectly.
			Good morning.
			Doctor.
			I'd like to run a couple of tests
			today... most of it is fairly
			boring: blood work, molecular
			studies, things like that.
			Why do you wish to do these tests?
			I need the data for some
			preparatory work I've been doing.
			Work... on the implants?
			Yes.
			I will not submit to the test.
			I'm not trying to pressure you...
			but we need to have some of this
			work done in case you change your
			mind.
			I have made my decision. I wish
			to die.
			There are alternatives other than
			full recovery and ending your
			life. The use of neural implants
			is only one of them.
			I am not interested.
			You haven't even heard me out.
			No!
			Leave me... please.
			Doctor?
			I was on my way to look in on your
			patient.
			Be my guest... but don't expect
			a lot of conversation, he's in
			full Klingon mode: honorable,
			strong... and closed-minded.
			I understand you've relieved
			Doctor Russell of duty.
			That's right. She's
			irresponsible. I won't have her
			practicing medicine on this ship.
			Beverly... maybe you should
			consider letting her go ahead with
			the genetronic procedure.
			How can you say that? She has
			a theory, based on a little
			empirical data and a lot of
			supposition...
			If he can't make a full
			recovery... Worf's going to kill
			himself.
			Not in my sickbay, he's not. I'll
			put him in a restraining field
			and post security outside the door
			before I let him commit suicide.
			How long could you keep him like
			that? A week... a month... a
			year?
			If I have to. Suicide is not an
			option.
			Setting aside for the moment the
			fact that a paraplegic can live
			a very full life, there is also
			a conventional therapy that can
			restore much of his mobility.
			But not all of it.
			No, not all of it! There are some
			things I can't fix. Klingon or
			not, he's got to accept that his
			condition---
			He can't make the journey you're
			asking of him, Beverly.
			You want him to go from
			contemplating suicide to accepting
			his condition and living with the
			disability. But that's too far...
			the road in between covers a
			lifetime of values and beliefs...
			he can't do it.
			But perhaps he can come part of
			the way... maybe he can be
			persuaded to forgo the ritual...
			in order to take a chance at
			regaining the kind of life he
			needs.
			A Klingon may not be able to
			accept defeat... but he knows all
			about taking risks.
			Starfleet Medical has rejected
			her proposals to use
			genetronics on humanoids three
			times.
			If they were aware of all the
			circumstances in this case...
			don't you think it might affect
			their decision?
			The first tenet of good medicine
			is don't make the patient any
			worse. Right now he's alive and
			functioning... but if he goes
			into this operation he'll probably
			come away a corpse.
			It may not be good medicine...
			but for Worf, it may be the only
			choice.
			Continue program.
			I am ready, Commander.
			I've been studying this ritual
			of yours, and you know what I've
			decided?
			I think it's despicable.
			I hate everything about it... the
			casual disregard for life...
			the way it tries to cloak suicide
			in some glorious notion of honor.
			I may have to respect your
			beliefs... but I don't have to
			like them.
			It is not something I expect you
			to understand.
			No... All you really expect me
			to do is bring you the knife and
			then walk away, so you can kill
			yourself in peace. Well, I'm not
			going to make it that easy for
			you.
			It is not easy for me. But each
			of us must die when his time
			comes... and my time---
			Do you remember Sandoval?
			Hit by a disruptor blast two years
			ago. She lived for about a week.
			How about Fang-lee... Marla
			Aster... Tasha Yar... how many
			good men and women -- how many
			friends have we watched die? Even
			I've lost count. But every one
			of them -- every single one --
			fought for life until the very
			end.
			I do not welcome death, Commander.
			Are you sure? I get the sense
			you're feeling pretty noble about
			the whole thing.
			Look at Worf... isn't he
			courageous? Isn't he an honorable
			Klingon?
			Well, let me remind you of
			something... a Klingon does not
			put his own desires above those
			of his family and friends.
			How many people on this ship
			consider you a friend? How many
			owe you their lives? Have you given
			any thought to how you have affected
			the people around you? And how
			they might feel about your dying?
			And what about the Klingon Empire?
			If you hadn't put yourself on the
			line, the Empire would be ruled
			by Duras and allied with the
			Romulans. Maybe you should
			think about what you still have
			left to do instead of lying
			around and --
			Enough!
			Will you, or will you not, help
			me with the Hegh'bat?
			You're my friend... and in spite
			of everything I've said... if it
			were my place, I'd probably help
			you.
			But I've been studying Klingon
			law and ritual... and I discovered
			that it's not my place to fill
			that role.
			According to tradition, that honor
			falls to a family member...
			preferably the oldest son.
			That is not possible. He is a
			child.
			"The son of a Klingon is a man
			the day he can first hold a
			blade." True?
			Alexander is not fully Klingon...
			he is part Human.
			That's an excuse. What you really
			mean to say is that it would be
			too hard for you to look at your
			son and tell him that he must hand
			you the knife... watch you stab
			it into your heart... and then
			pull the knife from your chest
			and wipe the blood on his sleeve.
			That is the rite of death, isn't
			it?
			I'm sorry, Worf... but I can't
			help you. There's only one
			person on board who can do that.
			You... wanted to see me?
			I need you to help me.
			Anything, Father.
			I've taught you about Klingon
			customs... the beliefs which
			we value.
			According to tradition, I must
			take my life after suffering this
			kind of injury.
			But I have decided to break with
			tradition. I have decided to
			live.
			I am glad, Father.
			I must still undergo a dangerous
			operation. I may still die. But
			it will not be by my own hand.
			Return this to our quarters.
			Yes, sir.
			Chief Medical Officer's log,
			supplemental. After further
			consultation with Starfleet
			Medical, and a great deal of
			soul-searching... I have
			reluctantly granted Lieutenant
			Worf's request to undergo the
			genetronic procedure.
			We started doing multiplications
			today. The teacher said I'm
			faster than anybody else in my
			class.
			We will speak again soon.
			Yes, Father.
			If I die... he must be cared
			for...
			I'll make sure he reaches your
			parents' home safely.
			No. My parents are elderly. They
			cannot care for Alexander.
			Counselor, I have given this a
			great deal of thought... I have
			a serious request to make of you.
			Would you consider...
			You want me to raise Alexander... ?
			I have come to have a great...
			... respect for you, Deanna. You
			have been most helpful in guiding
			me since Alexander's arrival.
			I cannot imagine anyone who would
			make a better parent to my son.
			If it is too much to ask...
			I'd be honored.
			I am ready.

			in the isocortex.
			Twenty cc's inoprovaline.
			Okay, release the retractors on
			the paraspinal, please.
			How much longer can we keep him
			on life support?
			Twenty-seven minutes.
			Close, please.
			Ready.
			Tissue growth proceeding at the
			anticipated rate... no initial
			signs of rejection...
			Okay. We're ready. Terminate
			life support.
			Life support disengaged.
			Looking good so far...
			Fluctuations in the isocortex.
			Forty cc's inoprovaline.
			Synaptic response falling.
			BP dropping... now sixty over
			ten. VeK'tal response falling
			rapidly.
			Increase oxygen mixture to
			ninety-five percent.
			Beginning direct synaptic
			stimulation.
			Respiration is shallow and rapid.
			No response in the isocortex!
			Seventy-five cc's inoprovaline.
			Heart rate erratic.
			He's going into cardiac arrest.
			Okay... let's go to chlromydride.
			Fifteen cc's.
			We're losing him.
			No BP, no pulse.
			Brain activity?
			Showing no higher brain
			functions.
			All right... twenty-five cc's of
			cordrazine.
			That'll kill him.
			Looks like we've done a pretty
			good job of that already, Doctor.
			No BP, no pulse... no activity
			in the isocortex.
			Cortical stimulator.
			Now.
			Again.
			Doctor...
			Again.
			Beverly.
			All right...
			Make a note in the log.
			Death occurred at... twelve
			hundred, forty hours.
			It was all going so well... no
			anomalies during replication...
			no initial rejection...
			No...
			Alexander... I'm so sorry...
			I want to see him.
			Alex...
			No. I want to see him!
			Activate biomonitors. Twenty-five
			cc's polyadrenaline.
			What's going on?
			I'm not sure...
			But, if I'm right, one of those
			"unnecessary redundancies" might
			be---
			Doctor!
			That's it! Begin cardio-aid and
			ventilation.
			Look at that... he must have
			a backup for his synaptic
			functions as well.
			Vital signs are stabilizing...
			Well, I'd say your patient's
			recovery is going well. I've
			never seen anyone up on their feet
			so soon after this kind of
			surgery.
			You're not even going to
			acknowledge what I did for him
			are you? You just can't admit
			that it was my research which made
			this possible.
			I'm delighted that Worf is going
			to recover. You gambled. He won.
			Most of your patients aren't so
			lucky.
			You scare me, Doctor. You risk
			peoples' lives and justify it in
			the name of research. But genuine
			research takes time... sometimes
			a lifetime of painstaking,
			detailed work to get results.
			Not you -- you take shortcuts...
			right through living tissue. You
			put your "research" ahead of your
			patients, and as far as I'm
			concerned, that's a violation of
			our most sacred trust.
			No one remembers the patients who
			died unnecessarily... not in the
			glow of a remarkable achievement
			like this one, do they? I'm sure
			the work you've done here will be
			hailed as a stunning breakthrough.
			Enjoy your laurels, Doctor. I'm not
			sure I could.
			I told you this would take time,
			Worf.
			Your muscles are still sorting
			out the new neural inputs...
			don't rush it.
			Alexander, remember what we talked
			about. Your father wants to do
			this by himself.
			It's all right, Counselor. I
			would... appreciate some help
			from my son.
			We will... work together.
			Yes, sir.
