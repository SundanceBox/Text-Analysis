			Captain's Log, stardate 45156.1.
			Our mission to Mudor Five has
			been completed and since our next
			assignment will not begin for
			several days, we are enjoying a
			welcome respite from our duties.
			If it's a boy... Michael. After
			my father.
			Wait a minute... we decided on
			Hiro, after my father.
			We talked about this last night.
			That's right, and we decided on
			Hiro.
			Wait. I've got it. How about...
			William. Now there's a name...
			William O'Brien. That has a nice
			ring to it.
			It's all right. He's just doing
			somersaults.
			Right... there!
			He's going to be a hell of a
			gymnast.
			May I?
			If he's not turning, he's kicking
			and punching. When I want to
			sleep, he wants to wake up. At
			this point, I just wish it were
			over.
			Have to go -- I've got a
			transporter simulation to run on
			the bridge.
			Good-bye, Michael.
			No.
			Come on, Geordi
			No.
			Just try it once. It's not as
			hard as you think. I'm telling
			you... you'll be terrific.
			"... I am the very model of a
			modern major general, I've
			information vegetable, animal and
			mineral... "
			I can't do this! I can't sing in
			front of people.
			Yes you can! That was terrific!
			Now you were a little off pitch,
			but I think we can take care of
			that...
			Captain, I'd like to introduce
			the winners of the primary school
			science fair. This is Marissa,
			Jay Gordon, and Patterson.
			They're here for their tour.
			Hello.
			How do you do?
			Can we see the battle bridge?
			And the torpedo bay?
			I'm afraid not.
			But... we will be visiting both
			the hydroponics and astrophysics
			laboratories.
			I'm sure you'll have a wonderful
			time.
			Well. If you'll come with me...
			I'm not sure who to feel sorry
			for... the captain or the kids.
			I want you all to know that we on
			the Enterprise are very proud of
			the science fair winners.
			Perhaps some of you will choose
			to pursue a career in Starfleet.
			I heartily urge you to do so.
			Well, then. Ah... what did you
			do for your science projects?
			I planted radishes in this
			special dirt and they came up all
			weird!
			I see. Very commendable.
			And you?
			An analysis of the life span of
			the swarming moths of Gonal Four.
			They only live for twenty hours.
			Then they all die.
			How interesting. And you --
			Hang on -- we're falling!
			What happened?
			Sensors are picking up subspace
			distortions and high-energy
			particles directly to starboard.
			Looks like we ran into a quantum
			filament.
			Damage report?
			We've lost primary life-support.
			Switching to secondary systems.
			Impulse and warp engines are offline.
			There's another filament moving
			toward us, sir!
			All decks brace for---
			Counselor?
			I'm all right.
			Medical team to the bridge.
			Troi to sickbay.
			Troi to engineering.
			Counselor Troi to any crewmember,
			please acknowledge.
			The computer's down, looks like
			we still have impulse power...
			but not much else...
			Where's Lieutenant Monroe?
			Counselor...
			The turbolifts aren't working.
			We're trapped up here.
			Are you...
			Are you children all right?
			Picard to bridge.
			This is the captain. Can anyone
			hear me?
			Why don't they answer?
			I don't know.
			They're all dead.
			They're not dead. Communications
			are down, that's all.
			We're going to die, too.
			We most certainly are not --
			Listen to me!
			No one is going to die. The
			bridge will send a rescue party
			as soon as possible, so I want
			you to stop crying. Everything
			is going to be all right.
			This is the Federation Starship
			Enterprise calling any vessel
			within range. We are in distress
			and need assistance. Please
			respond.
			I'm still not sure we're even
			transmitting. I'll set the
			message on auto-repeat and see if
			we get a response.
			Are you all right?
			I'm alive. What the hell
			happened?
			We were hit by a quantum
			filament. Most of our systems
			are down and we haven't been able
			to contact anyone off the bridge.
			Well, don't count on leaving
			through there. An emergency
			bulkhead closed just beneath that
			lift.
			Confinement mode.
			Right. Isolation protocol.
			I'm... not really familiar with
			that protocol.
			If the computer senses a hull
			breach, it automatically closes
			emergency bulkheads to isolate
			the breach. Until we can clear
			those bulkheads, we'll be cut-off
			from the rest of the ship.
			I've got partial sensors back on-line.
			I'm picking up sporadic life-signs
			throughout the saucer section. 
			There are definitely survivors.
			What about Ten Forward?
			My... wife is there.
			I'm sorry, Chief, but the
			readings aren't that specific.
			Can you scan the drive section?
			I'm not reading any life-signs in
			the drive section.
			Could the sensors be
			malfunctioning?
			There's no way to know. Without
			the main computer, I can't run a
			diagnostic.
			Can you sense anything,
			Counselor?
			There are a lot of people still
			alive... many of them are hurt...
			but I can't tell where they are.
			We need to start emergency
			procedures. Who's the duty
			officer?
			Lieutenant Monroe was in command,
			but he's dead.
			I believe Counselor Troi is the
			senior officer on the bridge.
			Counselor Troi?
			She carries the rank of
			Lieutenant Commander.
			I'd appreciate... some
			suggestions.
			I recommend we initiate emergency
			procedure alpha two.
			By-pass computer control and
			place all systems on manual
			override.
			Very well.
			Aye aye, sir.
			May I suggest that our next
			priority be to stabilize life-
			support and try to reestablish
			intership communications.
			Yes.
			Mister Mandel, I'd like you to
			assist Ensign Ro.
			Yes, sir.
			How do you feel?
			Okay... but a little... foggy.
			Just lie still for a while.
			We'll get you to sickbay as soon
			as we can.
			Report.
			I have made a survey of all
			turbolifts and service crawlways
			on this deck. Our access to the
			bridge has been completely
			severed by emergency bulkheads.
			Sickbay?
			Heavy damage in section twenty-
			three-A has cut-off access to
			sickbay. I have ordered a
			security team to move all
			casualties on this deck to Ten
			Forward until further notice.
			We should assume the worst...
			that everyone on the bridge is
			dead and no one is in control of
			the ship.
			In that circumstance, 
			reestablishing control should
			be our top priority.
			Agreed. Can we get to
			engineering?
			The direct route is blocked, but
			there might be a way to reach it
			through a starboard service
			crawlway.
			Okay -- you and I will try to get
			there. Worf, this room is going
			to be filled with wounded in a
			few minutes and they're going to
			need help. I want you to remain
			in charge here.
			Yes, sir.
			Let's go.
			Bring her here!
			Okay... clear the power shunt...
			bypass the flow current...
			and...
			The computer still won't release
			the doors.
			Can we force them open?
			We can try. There's an emergency
			hand actuator.
			Geordi...
			Yes?
			Geordi, this wall's hot.
			I'm all right.
			But I think we've got a new
			problem.
			One of the energy conduits
			must've ruptured and ignited the
			polyduranide inside the bulkhead.
			That's a plasma fire.
			It's putting out a lot of
			radiation. We can't stay in here
			very long.
			We've got a bigger problem than
			that.
			The quaratum in these containers
			is used in emergency thruster
			packs. It's normally pretty
			stable stuff... but when you
			expose quaratum to radiation it
			has a way of... exploding.
			The external power has been cut
			off.
			We're going to die.
			What was that?
			I don't know.
			Your name... is Marissa. Is that
			right?
			How old are you?
			Nine. And a half.
			Really? And the boys?
			Seven... and six.
			Well, I'm going to need a first
			officer to help me. You're the
			oldest... so that makes you
			Number One.
			Number One?
			That's what I've always called my
			first officer. Here.
			Now... we need a crew to help us
			get that hatch off.
			Number One... I think Jay might
			make an excellent science
			officer. Don't you agree?
			Yes. Yes, sir, Captain.
			Will you join our crew, Jay?
			Excuse me. It's Jay Gordon.
			Of course. Forgive me. Jay
			Gordon.
			I accept.
			Can I be an officer, too?
			Let's see... your science project
			involved radishes, did it not?
			Yeah... weird ones.
			Excellent. You'll be our
			executive officer in charge of
			radishes.
			Now -- let's get to work.
			Thirteen-sixty-five-baker. That
			should put us near shuttlebay
			two.
			That is correct, sir. We have
			approximately fifty-two meters
			remaining in this crawlway before
			we can safely exit into a main
			corridor.
			Coolant leak!
			We can withstand this level of
			radiation for another three or
			four hours without any permanent
			damage.
			But we'll need a few days of
			hyronalin treatments.
			What are the radiation levels in
			the quaratum?
			They're at eighty-three rads and
			rising about four rads per
			minute.
			That stuff gets unstable at
			around three hundred fifty rads.
			I still can't get any power to
			this transporter.
			The radiation levels are twenty
			percent lower at this end of the
			bay. Let's move the containers
			over here.
			That should buy us some time.
			We're going to have to do this by
			hand. With this much radiation
			flying around in here we can't
			trust the anti-grav units.
			There. Just before the second
			time we were hit... see the
			subspace distortion?
			Yes.
			How big are these quantum
			filaments?
			They can be hundreds of meters
			long, but they have almost no
			mass... which is why they're so
			difficult to detect.
			So, it's like a... cosmic string?
			No... that's a completely
			different phenomenon.
			How'd you do that?
			I diverted power from the phaser
			array and dumped it into the
			engineering control system.
			You what?
			The engineering station's on-line,
			Counselor.
			That's a completely improper
			procedure. You can't dump that
			much raw energy into a bridge
			terminal without---
			We aren't going to get out of
			this by playing it safe.
			What's our engine status, Ensign?
			We've got half impulse power
			available.
			But I'm getting some odd readings
			from the warp drive...
			I'm reading a spike in the warp
			field array... looks like a
			containment deviation...
			Switch to primary bypass...
			Nothing. Field strength's at
			forty percent and falling.
			We've got a problem. The quantum
			resonance of the filament caused
			a polarity shift in the antimatter
			containment field.
			When the filament hit us, the
			ship was momentarily charged...
			as if it had... come into
			contact with a live electrical
			wire.
			That weakened the containment
			field surrounding the antimatter
			pods. The field strength is down
			to forty percent and it's still
			falling.
			If it falls to fifteen percent...
			the field will collapse and
			there'll be a containment breach.
			Which means... ?
			The ship will explode.
			The current cannot be shut down
			from this relay box.
			We can't just sit here.
			If the energy flowing through
			this arc were interrupted by a
			nonconductive material, it is
			likely that the circuit would be
			broken.
			I don't see any material in here
			that could stop that much
			current.
			Commander, most of my bodyframe
			is composed of tripolymers, a non-
			conductive material.
			You're suggesting using your own
			body?
			Yes, sir.
			Data, there's at least half a
			million amps flowing through that
			arc. Can you take that much
			current?
			The power surge would cause a
			system failure in most of my
			internal processors and melt my
			primary power couplings.
			However, there is a chance that
			the damage would not be
			irreparable.
			No.
			Commander, our choices are very
			limited.
			First of all, android or not, I
			won't allow anyone to take that
			kind of risk. Second, if the
			computer isn't working in
			engineering, I'm going to need
			your help to get control of the
			ship.
			My positronic brain has several
			layers of shielding to protect it
			from power surges. It would be
			possible for you to remove my
			cranial unit and take it with
			you.
			You want me to take your head
			off?
			Yes, sir.
			Is there something wrong?
			Well, Data... it's just... I
			mean, will you be all right?
			My neural nets and memory core
			are self-contained.
			I will be fine.
			Like you said... our choices are
			very limited.
			Data? Data!
			A remarkable experience,
			Commander.
			How are you? Did the shielding
			work?
			Apparently so. My neural nets
			are fully operational.
			You may begin by opening the
			ventral access panel located two
			centimeters beneath my right ear.
			Feel around the edge of the
			illumination module -- of the big
			circle, until you find a small
			knob.
			I have it.
			Now with your other hand, reach
			around the far side of the
			module... there should be another
			knob.
			Okay, I found it.
			Good. Good. Pull both knobs out
			at the same time and then let go.
			Now push up... and slide the
			hatch over to the side.
			Jay Gordon, can you pull yourself
			up?
			Yes. I think so.
			Can you tell what deck we're on?
			There should be a large number on
			the wall of the shaft.
			It says "eleven".
			Good. Now look down at the side
			of the lift. Do you see two big
			clamps?
			Yes.
			Can you see if both clamps are
			connected to a... long beam
			inside a... a big groove?
			Yes. But one of them looks
			broken. It's half out of the
			groove.
			All right. Come down.
			Number One, those big clamps are
			part of the emergency system. If
			something goes wrong, they're
			designed to hold the turbolift in
			place.
			But they seem to have been
			damaged.
			Is that why we keep shaking?
			That's right.
			When that clamp gives way, we'll
			fall. You're going to have to
			take your crew out of here before
			that happens. There's a ladder
			along the inside of the
			turboshaft. You can use it to
			climb up until you find an open
			doorway.
			What about you?
			My leg is broken. I'll only slow
			you down and you need to move
			quickly.
			You'll have to be the leader.
			That's an order.
			We have to climb up the shaft.
			What about the captain?
			I'm not going. Commander Marissa
			is in charge.
			I wanna stay here with you.
			Patterson, you're an officer,
			now. You have to obey orders.
			I don't wanna be an officer
			anymore. I wanna stay with you.
			If the captain stays here, we
			won't make it. We'll all die.
			There's no time to argue, you
			have to go now.
			I don't want to!
			The crew has decided to stick
			together. We all go or we all
			stay.
			All right. I'll try. But I want
			you to know... this is mutiny.
			Number One, look at that panel...
			do you see a bright yellow cap?
			Yes.
			Pull the cap toward you and then
			turn it... it should come off.
			Good. Now, that bundle of
			wires... that's optical
			cabling... see how much you can
			pull out...
			The levels are still rising.
			There must be some way to put
			that thing out.
			The energy's being fed by the
			ship's internal power grid and we
			can't even get near that. The
			only way to stop it would be to
			eliminate the supply of oxygen.
			Wait a minute...
			Doctor, I've got an idea. It's
			pretty wild, but we might be able
			to kill two birds with one stone.
			Let's hear it.
			If we open the external door it
			would depressurize the cargo bay,
			and blow all those containers out
			into space. At the same time,
			the lack of oxygen should knock
			out the plasma fire.
			What about us?
			We'll have to find something in
			here to hang onto while the air
			is evacuated. After that, we'll
			shut the door and repressurize
			the bay.
			This looks like it'll have to do.
			There... that should do it.
			There will be a sharp pain as I
			set the bone. Prepare yourself.
			Good... good. You bore that
			well.
			I'm all right... I think...
			Perhaps you should lie down.
			Okay.
			I'm having contractions...
			I believe that is not uncommon in
			the late months of pregnancy...
			I mean contractions... I'm going
			into labor.
			You cannot. This... this is not
			a good time.
			It's not open for debate. Like
			it or not -- this baby is coming.
			If the containment field strength
			keeps dropping at this rate, we
			still have at least two hours
			before it becomes critical.
			But you're ignoring the fact that
			the power coupling is also
			damaged.
			If that coupling overheats, the
			field strength will begin to drop
			a lot faster. We could have a
			containment breach in a matter of
			minutes.
			What do you suggest?
			We should separate the saucer
			now, and put as much distance as
			possible between us and the drive
			section.
			Excuse me, sir, but that's damn
			cold-blooded. What about the
			people down there?
			There's no evidence anyone is
			still alive in the drive section.
			There's no evidence they're dead,
			either. If you were trapped down
			there, would you want us to cut
			you loose and leave?
			Of course not. But I also
			wouldn't expect the bridge crew
			to risk the safety of the ship
			and hundreds of lives in a futile
			effort to rescue me.
			You said there's no way to
			stabilize the containment field
			from the bridge. Could it be
			done from engineering?
			Yes... but my readings indicate
			there's no power down there.
			They don't even have monitors to
			tell them there's a problem.
			Could we divert energy from the
			bridge... to those monitors?
			Yes, sir.
			I'll say it again: there's no
			reason to believe anyone's alive
			in engineering. We're wasting
			time even talking about this. We
			have to separate the ship now.
			I believe there are people still
			alive down there... and I'm
			going to give them every chance.
			Assuming they are alive, they'll
			be hoping there's someone up here
			to help them. So we'll help
			them.
			Divert the necessary power to
			engineering.
			Aye, sir.
			I remind you, Counselor... that
			power coupling could overheat at
			any time. By not separating the
			ship now, you may be responsible
			for all our deaths.
			Thank you, Ensign. Proceed.
			I can't open this door.
			We'll have to climb up to the
			next deck.
			What if that one doesn't open
			either?
			Then we'll never get out.
			Quiet. That's an order.
			We're going up. Ready?
			Ready, sir.
			The lift's falling! Hang on!
			We're all right. We're going to
			keep climbing. Don't look down.
			What's wrong?
			He's scared.
			We're right here with you,
			Patterson. You're not going to
			fall.
			Everything will be all right if
			you keep moving.
			What we need -- is a climbing
			song. Marissa, what's a song you
			sing in school?
			"The Laughing Vulcan and His Dog"?
			I'm afraid I don't know that one.
			I know -- "Frere Jacques". We
			used to sing that when I was your
			age. Patterson, do you know that
			song?
			It goes like this... "Frere
			Jacques, Frere Jacques... "
			"... dormez vous, dormez vous... "
			"... sonnez les matines, sonnez
			les matines, ding din dong, ding
			din dong. Frere Jacques... "
			"... Frere Jacques, dormez vous,
			dormez vous... "
			Your contractions are now only
			twenty seconds apart.
			It feels like they're constant...
			They will continue to come closer
			together until you reach the
			bearing down phase.
			Dilation has gone to nine
			centimeters since the onset of
			labor.
			That did not take long.
			Easy for you to say...
			You are doing very well. I am
			sure the child will arrive soon.
			Worf... has the baby turned?
			Turned... ?
			So the head is down. Doctor
			Crusher told me a few days ago it
			hadn't... but she wasn't worried
			because I still had a month to
			go...
			I am not certain.
			Can't you tell?
			Worf... have you ever done this
			before? Delivered a baby?
			No. But I have taken the
			Starfleet Emergency Medical
			Course. In a computerized
			simulation, I assisted in the
			delivery of a human baby.
			Sometimes... things don't go by
			the book...
			I am sure everything will be
			fine.
			Once the air is vented, the first
			thing you'll feel is extreme
			pressure in your lungs... you'll
			have to resist the temptation to
			exhale. Next, your hands and
			feet will get cold, then numb...
			and some of the capillaries in
			exposed sections of skin may
			burst.
			Sounds like fun.
			We'll have about fifteen seconds
			of useful consciousness left.
			After that, there's about ten
			seconds of extreme
			disorientation, then we pass out.
			After the air has been evacuated,
			one of us will have to get to
			that panel and repressurize the
			bay.
			We're ready.
			The field strength is down to
			twenty percent. We can't run the
			risk of staying here any longer.
			We're not in danger until it
			drops below fifteen percent. We
			can afford to wait and see if
			anyone in engineering notices
			those monitors.
			Have you made preparations to
			separate the Saucer Section?
			Yes, sir. We're in stand-by mode
			for docking latches and --
			Ensign -- there's a thermal
			inversion in the power coupling!
			Quick... cross-connect it to the
			transfer coil.
			What happened?
			Exactly what I said might happen.
			The power coupling overheated and
			the entire containment field
			almost collapsed.
			O'Brien's fixed it temporarily,
			but it could happen again at any
			moment, and next time we might
			not be able to stop it. You
			can't let wishful thinking guide
			your decision. It's time to
			leave, Counselor.
			We will separate the ship when I
			have decided that it's time, not
			before. Is that clear, Ensign?
			Yes. Perfectly.
			Okay, try it.
			Very good, Commander. You have
			established the connection. I
			can now raise the door.
			There's no power on the entire
			deck, but somehow these monitors
			are working.
			Commander, the power reaching
			those monitors has been diverted
			from the bridge.
			But why... ?
			Unless there's something they
			want us -- something they need us
			to see...
			Data -- the containment field
			strength is down to eighteen
			percent!
			Can you stabilize it?
			I do not have access to the
			containment field. You will have
			to establish a new link.
			Locate the ODN conduit.
			Got it.
			You must now change the input
			matrix in my secondary optical
			port and then connect the ODN
			conduit.
			That is not the correct port,
			sir.
			Sorry.
			Commander, you must hurry, the
			field has dropped to sixteen
			percent.
			I'm trying. You need a bigger
			head.
			The field is still dropping --
			collapse is imminent.
			All right, try it!
			I have a connection.
			I am now stabilizing the
			containment field.
			That's using your head, Data.
			All right. Stand by to separate
			the Saucer Section --
			Sir... the field strength is
			stabilizing...
			Eighteen percent... twenty...
			twenty-five...
			I guess they got our message.
			I was wrong, Counselor.
			You could have just as easily
			been right.
			Congratulations. You are fully
			dilated to ten centimeters.
			You may now give birth.
			I thought that's what I've been
			trying to do...
			Bearing down is the next stage.
			It should start at full dilation.
			Why has it not begun?
			I don't know... I don't think
			it's up to me... it happens when
			it happens...
			My computer simulation was not
			like this. That delivery was
			very orderly.
			Well, I'm sorry...
			Did you feel an uncontrollable
			urge to push?
			Good! You are bearing down. Now
			you must push with each
			contraction and I must urge you
			gently but firmly to push harder.
			Push, Keiko. Push hard...
			Push... push...
			I am pushing --
			The baby is emerging head first.
			One more contraction...
			Okay...
			That's good -- push... harder...
			I have the baby!
			I will now smack the child to
			induce breathing --
			I believe she looks like Chief
			O'Brien.
			You were wonderful, Worf. I
			couldn't have done it without
			you.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are en route to Starbase Sixty-seven,
			to undergo repairs. Life
			aboard the Enterprise is slowly
			returning to normal.
			Just can't stay away from the big
			chair anymore, can you?
			I don't think I'm cut out to be
			captain... first officer,
			maybe... I understand there
			aren't many qualifications.
			Captain Picard to the bridge,
			please.
			There are some visitors here to
			see you, Captain.
			Hello. It's good to see you
			again. What brings you to the
			bridge?
			"In appreciation for the way you
			helped us get out of the
			turboshaft, and the way you
			helped us not be scared."
			We want to present to you this
			com-mem-mor-a-tive plaque.
			Give it to him.
			Thank you, very much.
			I made the back piece.
			And you did a wonderful job.
			Later this afternoon, we'll
			finish the tour I promised you.
			Starting with the battle bridge.
			I'll see you at fourteen hundred
			hours.
			You have the bridge, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
