			... there's a time when you want
			to call a Romulan's bluff and
			there's a time when you don't...
			Wouldn't you say?
			Yes, well, one does not always
			have the luxury...
			You've got to choose your time
			and place with them. True or
			false?
			Whenever possible.
			So, this time you were lucky.
			I suppose all's well that ends
			well but if I had been in your
			shoes...
			Well, it looks very nice,
			Mot... that should suffice...
			Hold on...
			...there.
			I must tell you, Captain, Will
			Riker was in for a trim
			yesterday... and he agreed with
			me a hundred per cent...
			Bridge to Captain Picard...
			Yes?
			Sorry to interrupt. We're
			receiving an emergency distress
			signal from the Solarion Four
			colony.
			Uh oh, right along the Cardassian
			border...
			Lay in a new course. I'm on my
			way.
			I told him we never should have
			colonized that close to the
			Cardassians...
			Report.
			The signal ended abruptly at oh
			four five five... unable to raise
			them on subspace...
			Hail them on upper and lower band
			frequencies, Mister Worf...
			I've tried, sir. No response.
			Time to the Solarion system?
			Twenty-six minutes, Captain.
			I understand you've been
			discussing alternative adversarial
			engagement strategies with Mot.
			It would be more accurate to say
			he was discussing them with me...
			He's the best barber in
			Starfleet... what can you do... ?
			Sir, receiving another signal from
			a vessel leaving orbit of Solarion
			Four... new frequency, low
			band... audio only...
			Open the channel.
			This is the Bajorans. We claim
			responsibility for the destruction
			of the Federation colony on
			Solarion Four. As long as we are
			without our homeland, no one will
			be safe in this sector.
			Captain's log, stardate 45076.3.
			We have arrived at Lya Station
			Alpha with survivors from Solarion
			Four. Admiral Kennelly has
			rendezvoused to discuss the
			Bajoran terrorist attack.
			Sorry...
			Ginger tea with honey, very hot.
			Ginger tea?
			My Aunt Rebecca's cure for the
			common cold.
			Common, hell... I picked this up
			from the Cardassian liaison last
			weekend. It's some damn virus
			they've sic'ed on me.
			Did the liaison have anything to
			say about the attack?
			It's an old story for the
			Cardassians. They've had
			terrorist problems since they
			annexed the Bajoran home world
			forty years ago.
			But in forty years, the Bajorans
			have never attacked a Federation
			target...
			A new militant splinter group has
			broken away from the Bajoran
			settlement camps. Leader's name
			is Orta. Apparently he's willing
			to do whatever he has to to get
			attention...
			And our response?
			We're going to give him attention.
			I can't tell you how good this
			feels on my throat...
			Listen, I'm the first to say that
			the Bajorans deserve attention...
			chased off their own planet by
			the Cardassians, forced to wander
			the galaxy, settling wherever they
			can find room...
			On many worlds we've been to, they
			are isolated, treated as
			pariahs...
			The Federation has great sympathy
			for their cause... but they're
			not helping themselves with an
			attack like this.
			That's what you have to
			communicate to them.
			That could be done through
			diplomatic channels, Admiral...
			what do you really want from us?
			Find this terrorist leader,
			Orta... get him back "on the
			reservation"... any way you can.
			Any way I can...
			The Federation has dozens of
			settlements in that sector. We
			can't allow the violence to
			continue.
			And what do I have to offer that
			might persuade him to cooperate?
			Amnesty.
			Admiral...
			... and a promise that we will
			immediately begin to address this
			issue with the Cardassians...
			quietly, behind the scenes, using
			every legitimate means... the
			Bajorans have to be patient...
			They have endured generations of
			sympathy and promises. I cannot
			believe this Orta will be
			satisfied with more of the same.
			It's your job to see that he is,
			Jean-Luc.
			Riker to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			Captain, have you approved the
			transfer of a new officer to the
			Enterprise?
			Negative...
			Well, I've got one waiting to
			transport aboard...
			... complete with orders. Ensign
			Ro Laren.
			Ro Laren? From the Wellington?
			The same one, sir. Should I tell
			her a mistake's been made?
			Stand by, Commander.
			I wrote the orders.
			I thought she'd be valuable to
			you.
			Admiral... respectfully...
			I would appreciate some consulting
			rights on the assignment of a new
			officer... especially someone with
			the record of Ro Laren...
			She's Bajoran.
			There are other Bajorans in
			Starfleet... assign one of them...
			I've discussed this situation with
			her. I'm convinced she's the
			right one for the job...
			After what happened at Garon Two,
			she has no business serving on
			any starship as far as I'm
			concerned... let alone the
			flagship, my ship...
			You're taking her... it's all
			arranged... you have no idea how
			difficult it was to get her out
			of prison.
			It's that important to you...
			It's that important. To the
			mission.
			Picard to Riker.
			Go ahead.
			Proceed with the transport.
			Sir... ?
			I'll fill you in later, Commander.
			Yessir.
			Admiral, I hope neither of us
			regrets this.
			You can handle her, Captain. If
			anyone can.
			I'll be on my way, then. Actually,
			you know, I think I'm feeling
			better.
			Aunt Rebecca would be pleased.
			Energize.
			Ensign Ro Laren reporting as
			ordered, Commander.
			You'll follow the Starfleet
			uniform code aboard this ship,
			Ensign.
			There will be members of the crew
			who will not want to serve with
			Ensign Laren, Captain.
			They'll have to learn to live
			with it.
			I intend to demand the highest
			standards of performance from her.
			I would expect nothing less.
			It won't be for long, Will.
			Come.
			Yes, Ensign Laren, please have
			a seat...
			Ensign Ro. Sir.
			I beg your pardon?
			The Bajoran custom has the family
			name first, the individual's
			second. I am properly addressed
			as Ensign Ro.
			I'm sorry, I didn't...
			No reason you should know. It
			is an old custom. Most Bajorans
			these days accept the distortion
			of their names in order to
			assimilate. I do not.
			I wish to be candid with you,
			Ensign.
			Please.
			I am fully aware of your Starfleet
			record, your problems on other
			ships, the incident on Garon Two
			that led to your court martial.
			I feel it only fair to inform you
			that I am personally concerned
			about your presence on this most
			critical mission...
			I don't want to be here any more
			than you want me to be here. Sir.
			Then why did you accept this
			assignment?
			If I may be equally candid...
			it's better than prison.
			Better than prison. Ensign, there
			are officers who wait years to
			serve aboard this...
			... being called back into
			Starfleet wasn't my idea...
			... Nor ours...
			... and I'm not exactly happy about
			it.
			Nevertheless...
			... we are going to be serving
			together and I think it would be
			wise for Commander Riker and me
			to clearly voice our expectations
			and...
			Captain, I know the routine. You
			don't have to worry about me.
			We're stuck with each other.
			Let's get this over with as
			quickly as possible and we'll go
			our separate ways, okay?
			Dismissed.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are approaching the Valo system
			on the outskirts of Cardassian
			territory, where many Bajorans
			have resettled.
			There are dozens of Bajoran
			camps on the three M-class
			planets. I suggest we may want
			to begin on Valo Three, where an
			ad hoc leader named Jas Holza
			lives. The Federation has had
			several dealings with him...
			I met Holza at a symposium a few
			years ago...
			What can you tell us about him,
			Doctor?
			I found him to be a very concerned
			leader and a good spokesman for
			his people...
			And a terrific dancer...
			Really... at the reception
			afterwards...
			At least this man has genuine
			experience in diplomacy...
			That is not a small advantage on
			this mission... Very well...
			Mister Data, contact Holza,
			arrange a meeting... set a course
			for Valo Three.
			Ensign Ro, you're familiar with
			this star system; take the
			conn...
			Is there some problem, Ensign?
			You're wasting your time.
			Holza is nobody. He's the token
			Bajoran that "respectable"
			people...
			... invite to symposiums and
			diplomatic soirees. But he has
			no real influence among my people.
			Whom do you suggest we talk to,
			Ensign?
			Don't you understand? These are
			desperate people. Ready to martyr
			themselves. They don't want to
			talk...
			This ship is prepared to defend
			itself if necessary.
			It will be. Don't fool yourself.
			This mission will end in
			bloodshed.
			Well. Let us hope you are
			mistaken, Ensign. Now... perhaps
			you could point us in the right
			direction as Mister Data
			suggested.
			I would go to the camp on the
			southern continent of Valo Two...
			find a man named Keeve Falor.
			He has no diplomatic experience.
			And he won't ask you to dance.
			Captain's log, supplemental. I
			read about the achievements of
			the ancient Bajoran civilization
			in my fifth grade reader... they
			were architects and artists and
			builders and philosophers... when
			humans were not yet standing
			erect.
			Now I see how history has
			rewarded them...
			This used to be me.
			Baleekam... Balleek... balleek!
			Ro Laren, it has been a long
			time. We welcome your return.
			Keeve Falor. Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard. Commander Data and
			Lieutenant Worf.
			Thank you for meeting with us,
			Mister Keeve.
			You honor me by the proper use
			of my name, Captain.
			Ensign Ro has educated me.
			Has she. Good.
			I'm pleased you still remember.
			Let me show you our camp.
			We are not a violent race,
			Captain. Just passionate about
			our cause. And that passion has
			led some to take up arms.
			Do you know where we can find
			Orta?
			I'm afraid not.
			Might you be able to help us
			locate him?
			I'm sorry. I don't wish to help
			you.
			Don't misunderstand. I for one
			believe the raid on the Federation
			outpost was poor judgment. You
			are innocent bystanders, and I
			cannot condone violence against
			those who are not our enemies.
			Then I don't understand why you
			are unwilling...
			Because you are innocent
			bystanders.
			You were innocent bystanders for
			decades as the Cardassians took
			our homes... as they violated and
			tortured our people in the most
			hideous ways imaginable... as we
			were forced to flee...
			We were saddened by those
			events... but they occurred within
			the designated borders of the
			Cardassian Empire...
			... and the Federation is pledged
			not to interfere in the internal
			affairs of others.
			How convenient it must be for you.
			To turn a deaf ear to those who
			suffer behind a line on a map.
			I'm not here to debate Federation
			policy. I am prepared to offer
			assistance...
			Simply because of one terrorist
			attack? Then perhaps I have been
			wrong. We should have attacked
			the Federation long ago. What
			do you think of that, Ro?
			I think you are a small man who
			feels a rush of power in his belly
			and enjoys it far too much,
			Keeve. Stop talking and listen.
			We have had our own problems with
			the Cardassians... now that there
			is a treaty, we are in a position
			to help. Your people have been
			forced to resettle all over the
			quadrant. We can make a
			legitimate case with the
			Cardassians that this is no longer
			an isolated problem. We will work
			diplomatically on your behalf...
			but first the terrorist attacks
			must end.
			We live in different universes,
			you and I. Yours is about
			diplomacy, politics, strategy.
			Mine is about blankets. If we
			were to exchange places for a
			night, you would better
			understand.
			Mister Data -- see to it that our
			replicators provide blankets for
			every man, woman and child here
			before nightfall.
			Yessir.
			Mister Worf, you will determine
			if these people have any other
			emergency needs and provide
			whatever we can...
			Aye, sir.
			Return to your ship. I will
			contact you when I have any
			information that might be of
			assistance. Ensign.
			You were helpful.
			The blankets were helpful...
			nothing I said mattered.
			In an age when their technology
			should be able to feed and clothe
			all of them... that they should
			have to live like this...
			I couldn't. And I wouldn't.
			That's one reason why I ran away.
			They are lost... defeated...
			I will never be.
			Captain's log, stardate 45077.8.
			Keeve Falor has kept his promise
			and directed us toward the third
			moon of Valo One... where we will
			meet tomorrow with the terrorist
			leader, Orta.
			Do you mind if we join you?
			Yes.
			... I'll tell you one thing... if
			I find myself on an away team with
			Ensign Ro... I'll never turn my
			back on her...
			The captain obviously thought
			she'd be valuable on this mission.
			This was orders. Had to be. She
			doesn't belong here. Doesn't
			belong in the uniform if you ask
			me.
			Really.
			Really.
			Sounds like someone I'd like to
			meet.
			Am I disturbing you?
			Yes.
			Good. You look like someone who
			wants to be disturbed.
			I'd rather be alone.
			No you wouldn't.
			I beg your pardon... ?
			If you wanted to be alone, you
			would've stayed in your quarters.
			Only reason to come here is to
			be around people.
			There's always the view...
			You've been looking at your drink
			all night. How's the view?
			Who are you?
			Guinan. I keep the bar. I
			listen.
			Heard anything interesting?
			Everyone's talking about you.
			Heard anything interesting?
			Uh-huh.
			It's all true.
			I've always found that truth is
			in the eye of the beholder.
			Isn't that supposed to be
			"beauty"?
			"Truth", "beauty"... works for
			a lot of things.
			They say you never told anyone
			the truth about Galon Two. You
			didn't even defend yourself at
			the court martial.
			What was to defend? I didn't
			follow orders. Eight members of
			the away team died.
			Your fault.
			My fault.
			So you sit alone in crowded rooms
			staring at your drink.
			You kind of enjoy it, don't you?
			Enjoy it... ?
			You go out of your way to torture
			yourself... You work so hard at
			it, you've gotta love it.
			Who are you?
			Guinan. I tend the bar. I
			listen.
			You're not like any bartender I
			ever met.
			You're not like any Starfleet
			officer I ever met.
			This might be the start of an
			interesting friendship.
			I never stay anywhere long enough
			to make friends.
			Too late. You just made one.
			Bridge to Ensign Ro.
			Go ahead.
			Subspace communication coming in
			for you, Ensign.
			Thank you.
			Computer, direct subspace
			transmission to monitor...
			Your report, Ensign.
			Everything's going exactly as you
			predicted, Admiral...
			Any indications of weapons or
			vessels beneath the surface?
			The composition of the moon's
			crust is blocking the sensors...
			... which is very likely why they
			chose this moon for their base
			of operations...
			We're on a timetable here.
			Where's Ro?
			Captain Picard to Ensign Ro.
			Computer, locate Ensign Ro.
			Ensign Ro is not on board the
			Enterprise.
			Check the transport log.
			She beamed down almost six hours
			ago, sir...
			Mister Collins, any activity at
			the designated site of our
			meeting...
			No, sir. They didn't show up...
			What the hell is going on...
			Prepare to transport us to the
			same location Ensign Ro beamed
			to... Mister Worf, phasers...
			The tricorder is picking up
			molecular displacement traces...
			it suggests movement through
			this area during the last ten
			hours...
			See if we can determine their
			direction... Standard search
			pattern...
			Maintain tricorder security
			link.
			Data, I'm picking up energy
			fluctuations over here...
			Troi to Picard.
			Captain, acknowledge...
			Data to Picard... Data to Worf...
			Captain Picard... I am Orta.
			Please excuse my appearance.
			Unfortunately, as a guest of the
			Cardassians some years ago, my
			face... was mutilated... my vocal
			cords cut.
			Abducting us was not necessary.
			I'm sorry. But after speaking
			with Ro Laren, I decided that it
			was.
			Then she has done us both a
			disservice. For I am committed
			to peace.
			I am not at all interested in
			peace. And I am not convinced
			you are, either.
			Captain, I did not come here to
			undermine the mission...
			Ensign, whatever your motives,
			you have already done enough
			damage to these negotiations.
			With your permission, Orta, I will
			have her transported back to my
			ship.
			I came here to convince these
			people to listen to you... I
			didn't want this to end in
			bloodshed...
			There will be no bloodshed...
			You don't know all the facts,
			Sir.
			Perhaps you could share them
			with me.
			Ro Laren is attempting to protect
			the interests of two worlds,
			Captain. She finds herself
			uncomfortably caught between them.
			If you wish her to remain, I will
			agree, but she is not helping
			matters by fostering distrust
			between us...
			I believe her concerns are
			justified.
			I can assure you....
			All is not what it seems to be,
			Captain. Perhaps someone is using
			you to get to me... perhaps you
			are a victim of this deception
			as well, I do not know.
			Deception?
			Your mission was to seek out the
			Barjoran terrorists who destroyed
			the Federation settlement on
			Solarion Four...
			Yes...
			As I have informed Ro Laren --
			it was not the Bajorans.
			... he admits responsibility for
			dozens of attacks on Cardassian
			targets. Why should we believe
			him about Solarion Four?
			He has no reason to lie.
			He fears our reprisal.
			I didn't perceive fear or
			deception from him.
			If they did not attack Solarion
			Four, who did? And why would
			anyone want to falsely implicate
			the Bajorans?
			Perhaps someone wanted to draw
			us into this conflict...
			But what would anyone have to
			gain by that... ?
			Ensign. May I see you in my ready
			room?
			Yessir.
			You do not leave this ship without
			authorization.
			Captain, I'm sorry, but...
			This is not a discussion. You're
			restricted to your quarters for
			the remainder of the mission.
			Dismissed.
			What?
			Heard you'd been grounded.
			I really don't feel like talking
			right now.
			Sure you do.
			How come every time I tell you
			something you tell me I really
			mean the exact opposite?
			You're one of those people who's
			got their poles reversed... you
			take a little unscrambling, but
			I've had a lot of practice.
			So what do you feel like talking
			about?
			Nothing you can help me with.
			Never know until you try.
			I got myself into this. I'm just
			trying to figure a way out.
			That's all.
			Without anyone getting killed this
			time.
			Seems like everybody's always just
			pulling my strings... that I've
			got no control.
			For people like you and me...
			who lose our homes... that's how
			life feels sometimes...
			You?
			My people lost their homeworld
			too.
			I'm in trouble.
			There's more going on here than
			anyone on this ship knows... it's
			more than I know how to deal with.
			And I don't know who to trust...
			Including yourself.
			Especially myself.
			I was in serious trouble once.
			More than I could handle alone.
			What kind of trouble?
			Not important now. Not yet. What
			is important is that I'd still
			be caught up in it to this day...
			if I hadn't trusted one man...
			Come.
			Ensign Ro has some things to talk
			to you about.
			Ensign Ro has been confined to
			her quarters.
			She can go right back to her
			quarters when she's done.
			Guinan, I don't know why you are
			involved in this, but...
			She's my friend.
			I have found that Guinan is very
			selective about whom she calls
			a friend.
			Sit down.
			Sir, when I'm finished telling
			you what I have to tell you...
			I'm probably gonna wind up back
			in the stockade. And if that's
			how it has to be...
			I just can't do this anymore.
			What is it you can't do anymore,
			Ensign?
			Admiral Kennelly came to me in
			prison... told me he'd arrange
			to get me out if I'd accept a
			mission...
			That part I know.
			Nossir. Not this mission. One
			for him and only him.
			You were being sent to talk, to
			negotiate... the Admiral knew that
			was hopeless... My job was to
			give Orta an incentive...
			What kind of incentive... ?
			One that you couldn't offer.
			That Starfleet couldn't offer.
			Orta was to end the terrorism
			against the Federation. Return
			with his people to the camps.
			In return he would get...
			Weapons. Ships. Things that
			could really make a difference
			against the Cardassians in the
			future.
			I find that... almost impossible
			to believe. To suggest that
			Admiral Kennelly would consider
			sending weapons to terrorists...
			If you ask him, he will deny it.
			But it's true. I didn't leave
			the ship without authorization...
			I received it last night from the
			Admiral.
			You have been in contact with
			Admiral Kennelly during this
			mission?
			Yessir. The subspace log can
			confirm that part of it at least.
			Arming these people would be a
			violation of all that the
			Federation stands for. You cannot
			be blind to that...
			Nossir. I'm not. But this was
			something... I had to do.
			When I was seven years old...
			I was given a piece of sugar candy
			and led by a Cardassian into a
			room. My father was sitting
			inside. And he looked at me with
			eyes I'd never seen... And then
			the Cardassian began to ask him
			questions... and during the next
			two hours as I was forced to
			watch, my father was tortured
			until he died. I remember feeling
			so... ashamed... as my father
			begged for mercy... I was ashamed
			of him for being so weak. I was
			ashamed of being Bajoran. Later
			I began to understand how
			misguided those feelings were.
			And yet somehow they have remained
			a part of me. I do not want to
			be ashamed of my heritage any
			longer.
			I serve the Federation. But I
			am Bajoran. A Starfleet admiral
			presented me with an opportunity
			to help my people in their fight
			against the Cardassians. I had
			to accept it.
			Have you made this offer to Orta?
			No. After he told me the Bajorans
			had not attacked Solarion Four...
			nothing made sense anymore. I
			decided to wait until I could
			figure out what was going on...
			That was a wise choice, Ensign.
			It probably saved you from another
			court martial.
			Have you briefed Admiral Kennelly
			since our return from the surface?
			Nossir. Captain, I don't know
			who to trust anymore...
			Then why did you come to me?
			That strange bartender of yours...
			She has a way of getting to you,
			you know?
			She said you were her friend.
			It seems we find ourselves with...
			something in common.
			Do you think Orta would cooperate
			with us to determine the truth
			here?
			I think I can persuade him.
			Good.
			Our orders were to find him, bring
			him back to the camps... any way
			we could... perhaps that is
			exactly what we should do.
			And then what?
			And then watch what happens.
			Captain's log, supplemental. I
			have become convinced that we are
			somehow involved in a conspiracy.
			I am hopeful the purpose behind
			it will be revealed in the next
			few hours.
			Well done, Captain.
			It was a team effort, Admiral.
			Ensign Ro proved invaluable.
			Good. What's the next step?
			The Enterprise will escort a
			Bajoran Antares-class carrier
			to the Valo Three camp at oh-five
			hundred hours... Orta and his
			people will be aboard.
			Keep us advised of your progress.
			Acknowledged.
			How's that Cardassian virus,
			Admiral?
			A little better, thanks.
			Good. We will report as soon as
			our mission is accomplished.
			Picard out.
			Ensign Ro, take us to the
			designated coordinates...
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Data...
			Yes, Captain?
			Keep an eye on the Cardassian
			border, will you?
			Aye, sir.
			The Bajoran vessel is moving up
			from the surface, Captain.
			On screen.
			Hail them, Mister Worf...
			Audio channel open... the ship
			has no visual capabilities.
			This is Captain Picard, we are
			prepared to escort you to Valo
			Three...
			Acknowledged, Captain. Be advised
			that our ship is limited to half
			impulse...
			Ensign Ro, set a course for Valo
			Three... half impulse.
			Aye, sir.
			Engage.
			I am monitoring increased activity
			inside Cardassian space... two
			ships are moving along the
			border... heading one-four-two
			mark zero-five-one...
			Mister Worf, can you identify the
			class of these ships?
			Cardassian warships... Galor
			class, type three...
			Top of the line...
			They are moving into a course
			parallel to our own, Captain.
			Yellow alert. Continue to monitor
			them...
			Ensign Ro, what's the closest we
			get to the Cardassian border on
			the current heading to Valo
			Three?
			Thirteen thousand, four hundred
			kilometers, sir.
			E-T-A?
			Eight minutes.
			That's where it will be.
			The Cardassian ships are changing
			course... they are crossing the
			border...
			They're increasing power to
			forward weapon grids...
			Red alert.
			Ensign Ro... change course to
			intercept the Cardassians... open
			channel to the Bajoran vessels...
			Open.
			This is the Enterprise. We are
			moving to intercept two Cardassian
			warships... maintain your present
			course and speed.
			Acknowledged, Enterprise.
			Cardassians are in visual range.
			On screen.
			We are being hailed by the
			Cardassians...
			Open a channel, Mister Worf.
			I am Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise...
			how can I help you?
			Gul Dolak, Cardassian Militia Four
			One. We have no argument with
			you, Captain...
			I'm pleased to hear that, Gul
			Dolak, for all of us in the
			Federation value the peaceful
			relations with our Cardassian
			neighbors.
			No more than we value the
			relations with our Federation
			neighbors.
			Good. Now that we've established
			our mutual good will... what's
			on your mind?
			We have identified the Bajoran
			ship you are escorting as a
			terrorist carrier...
			Terrorist carrier... are you
			certain?
			Most certain, Captain. It has
			committed many crimes against
			us... we know its markings
			well...
			Well, rest assured, there will
			be no terrorist attacks today.
			We are escorting these Bajoran
			settlers to the camp on Valor
			Three. You may monitor their
			course if you wish.
			We would request that you
			withdraw... and leave the matter
			to us.
			This is neutral space, Gul Dolak.
			You have no jurisdiction here.
			Nor do you.
			If we withdraw, what do you intend
			to do to the Bajoran vessel?
			We intend to destroy it.
			I see. Well, that puts me in a
			difficult position. I've promised
			to escort these people to their
			camps.
			You are protecting the enemies
			of the Cardassian people... if
			you do not withdraw, we will take
			great offense...
			I'm sorry to offend you, Gul
			Dolak. But I cannot withdraw.
			We are prepared to take any steps
			necessary.
			Is that intended as a threat?
			It is a complaint. From your
			Cardassian neighbors. You have
			one hour to withdraw. Dolak out.
			Advise Starfleet of our status,
			Mister Data.
			When Admiral Kennelly calls, I'll
			speak to him in my ready room.
			It seemed, Admiral, that they knew
			our course, our destination, our
			plan...
			I'm sure they monitor the border
			at all times for terrorist
			activity... their sensors just
			picked up Orta's ship, that's
			all...
			I'm not convinced of that...
			The important thing is, what do
			we do now?
			Any suggestions, Admiral?
			You have to protect the Cardassian
			peace, that's our top priority.
			Sir, I see no way to protect the
			Cardassian peace without
			sacrificing the Bajorans.
			If that's your call, I'll support
			it.
			No. I'm not willing to give them
			up.
			You're not looking at the big
			picture, Jean-Luc... we can't
			afford to lose the Cardassian
			treaty...
			Well, I just see a different big
			picture, Admiral... it looks
			something like this...
			I see the Cardassian liaison, with
			his Cardassian virus, coming to
			meet with you after the attack
			on Solarion Four. Now, we have
			a mutual enemy, he says. The
			Bajoran terrorists. The
			Cardassians can't find them. But
			maybe the Federation can. I am
			beginning to see that our mission
			has been, in fact, to expose
			Orta... so the Cardassians could
			move in and destroy him.
			I think you've lost your
			perspective, Captain. We'll
			discuss it further when you
			return. For now, I'm giving you
			a direct order to withdraw.
			Kennelly out.
			Ensign Ro, set a course, bearing
			one-eight-seven mark
			one-zero-two... one quarter
			impulse.
			Aye, sir.
			He ordered us to withdraw?
			The Cardassians are moving toward
			the Bajoran vessel, Captain.
			Hold present course.
			The Bajoran ship has been
			destroyed.
			Subspace transmission coming from
			Starfleet, Captain. Admiral
			Kennelly.
			On screen.
			It is on a secure channel.
			Perhaps in your ready room,
			Captain?
			No. Here. On screen.
			Report.
			The Cardassians have destroyed
			the Bajoran ship.
			All hands lost... ?
			No, sir.
			Survivors?
			No, sir. No one was on board.
			What are you talking about?
			The ship was controlled from the
			ground. Communications were
			handled through a subspace relay
			aboard the vessel.
			This was your idea, Picard?
			Actually, no... this was Ensign
			Ro's idea... but I fully endorsed
			it. I suspected that something
			like this might occur.
			They're terrorists, dammit. Why
			the hell would you want to protect
			them?
			I am more concerned with
			protecting the honor and integrity
			of Starfleet.
			Do you know how many of our people
			they killed on Solarion Four?
			The Bajorans did not attack Solarion
			Four.
			Is that what Orta told you?
			Yes.
			And you believed him?
			Admiral, Orta's ships are old and
			obsolete. They do not have warp
			capabilities. They could not have
			reached another star system...
			let alone attack one.
			But then who was responsible?
			I would suggest you ask your
			friend the Cardassian liaison,
			Admiral. The only explanation
			I can think of is that the
			Cardassians staged it.
			The Cardassians. Why?
			Perhaps they were hoping to find
			someone in Starfleet like you,
			Admiral, who would be foolish
			enough to solve their Bajoran
			problem for them.
			What will happen to him?
			I'm not sure. A hearing,
			definitely. Perhaps a court
			martial.
			If he's sent to the stockade on
			Jaros Two, tell him to request
			a room in the east wing... the
			west wing gets awfully hot in the
			afternoon.
			How soon do you intend to return
			to Lya Station Alpha, sir?
			A few weeks. We have some
			surveying to do in sector
			two-one-three-oh-five.
			Then, perhaps I should arrange
			for other transportation back.
			Ensign, you were recruited for
			one mission and if you wish to
			be relieved of further duty, I
			will approve it. But I'd like
			you to consider remaining in
			Starfleet.
			You're not serious.
			It would be a shame for Starfleet
			to lose someone with your
			potential.
			Thank you.
			But this uniform... it just
			doesn't fit, Captain... and you
			know it.
			That can change.
			I don't think so.
			I've observed a certain quality
			about you that... might be
			harnessed, molded...
			... don't count on it...
			There's still a lot you can learn
			from Starfleet, Ensign.
			I've always thought Starfleet
			could learn a lot from me,
			Captain.
			That is an attitude I have found
			to be common among the best
			officers I've served with.
			You are not one of those officers,
			Ensign, but you might be
			someday... if you decide to work
			at it.
			An interesting challenge, sir.
			And I rarely refuse an interesting
			challenge.
			There would be one condition.
			Condition... ?
			Picard to Enterprise. Two to beam
			up.
