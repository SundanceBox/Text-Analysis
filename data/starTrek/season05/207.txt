			What are you doing on Romulus?
			That was to be my question for
			you, sir.
			It is no concern of Starfleet's.
			On the contrary, Starfleet is most
			concerned. You are in a position
			to compromise the security of the
			Federation...
			You may assure your superiors that
			I am on a personal mission, of
			peace, and will advise them when
			appropriate.
			That will not be satisfactory.
			You cannot remain, Captain.
			And I cannot return without a full
			explanation.
			Ambassador, with the greatest
			respect for all you've achieved
			on behalf of the Federation, this
			sort of cowboy diplomacy is not
			easily tolerated any more...
			"Cowboy diplomacy"... ?
			If you wish to undertake a mission
			with potential repercussions to
			the Federation, it is appropriate
			to discuss it with the Federation.
			I am here as their representative.
			You will have to discuss it with
			me.
			This is precisely what I wanted
			to avoid.
			I also have the responsibility
			of bearing some unhappy news.
			Sarek is dead.
			Walk with me, Captain Picard.
			I know of your mind meld with my
			father... that enabled him to
			complete his last mission.
			It was an honor. He was a great
			man.
			He was a great representative of
			the Vulcan people and of the
			Federation.
			I was with him before coming here.
			He expressed his pride in you,
			his love...
			Emotional disarray is a symptom
			of the illness from which he
			suffered.
			No, the feelings were in his
			heart, Spock. He shared them
			with me. I know.
			Sarek would no more approve of
			my coming to Romulus than you do,
			Captain.
			For some time, I have been aware
			of a growing movement here...
			of people who seek to learn the
			ideals of the Vulcan philosophy.
			They have been declared enemies
			of the state. But there are a
			few in the Romulan hierarchy like
			Pardek who are sympathetic. He
			asked me to come now because he
			believes it may be time to take
			the first step toward
			reunification.
			Reunification... After so many
			centuries... so many fundamental
			differences that have evolved
			between your peoples...
			It would seem unlikely to succeed.
			But I cannot ignore the potential
			rewards that a union between our
			worlds would bring.
			What is this "first step" that
			Pardek suggests... ?
			There is a new Proconsul of the
			Romulan Senate. He is young and
			idealistic. He has promised many
			reforms. Pardek believes he may
			be receptive to discussing
			reunification.
			Why would you not bring something
			this important to the attention
			of your own people or the
			Federation?
			A personal decision, Captain.
			Perhaps you are aware that I
			played a small role in the first
			overture to peace with the
			Klingons...
			History is aware of the role you
			played, Ambassador.
			Not entirely. It was I who asked
			Kirk to lead that peace mission.
			And I who had to accept the
			responsibility for the
			consequences to him and his crew.
			Quite simply, I am unwilling to
			risk anyone's life but my own on
			this occasion. I would ask you
			to respect my wishes and leave.
			Ambassador, your logic escapes
			me. If I didn't know better, I
			would say your judgment had been
			influenced by emotion.
			You speak as my father would if
			he were here, Picard...
			I speak as a Starfleet officer
			and I cannot ignore the risks to
			you...
			I was involved with... "cowboy
			diplomacy", as you describe it,
			Captain, long before you were
			born.
			Nevertheless, sir, I am not
			prepared to leave until your
			affairs are completed.
			In your own way, you are as
			stubborn as another Captain of
			the Enterprise I once knew.
			Then, sir, I am in good company.
			We have more important things to
			attend to than acting as your
			nursemaids.
			Captain Picard regrets that he
			must detain you but it is
			necessary for a while longer.
			In addition, I will be requiring
			access to your ship's computer...
			Access to our computer... for what
			purpose?
			I am going to attempt to penetrate
			the Romulan Central Information
			Net...
			Don't bother. We've been trying
			for years.
			I have unique skills that may
			permit me to succeed.
			I cannot reveal classified Klingon
			entry codes to Starfleet...
			Your entry codes can be easily
			reconfigured after we depart.
			And Captain Picard has authorized
			me to share with you any
			information we obtain from the
			Romulan data banks...
			Anything else?
			We will also need to communicate
			with the Enterprise in sector
			two-thirteen.
			You do and the Romulans will
			instantly know our coordinates.
			Using conventional means, that
			would be true; however I propose
			that we piggy-back our signal on
			Romulan subspace transmissions...
			"Piggy-back"?
			A Human metaphor, pardon me. We
			would use a Romulan signal as a
			carrier for own own, thus
			disguising its origin.
			It won't work.
			I believe it will. During the
			last hour, I have conducted a
			systematic review of the entire
			Romulan subspace grid and compared
			my findings with the
			specifications of your
			transmission array. It would
			appear they are compatible.
			Thank you for your cooperation.
			Captain's notation. Recommend
			we study the potential for a
			Klingon artificial life entity.
			Allow me to brighten your table.
			Jolan True.
			The Senate has adjourned. Pardek
			will be here shortly...
			Just how widespread is this
			movement?
			There are groups in every
			populated area. I have personally
			spoken with members from four
			provinces.
			It has become a serious concern
			to the Romulan leadership.
			Serious enough for the leaders
			to suddenly embrace a Vulcan
			peace initiative? I have a
			difficult time accepting that.
			I sense you have a closed mind,
			Captain. Closed minds have kept
			these two worlds apart for
			centuries.
			In the Federation, we have learned
			from experience to view the
			Romulans with distrust. We can
			either choose to live with that
			enmity or seek an opportunity to
			change it. I choose the latter...
			I will be the first to cheer when
			the Neutral Zone is abolished,
			sir. I only wonder if this
			movement is strong enough to
			reshape the entire Romulan
			political landscape.
			One can begin to reshape the
			landscape with a single flower,
			Captain.
			Jolan True, Mister Spock... look
			what I've brought you...
			This is my friend, D'Tan... he
			is very curious about Vulcan...
			Hello, D'Tan...
			It is very old. Where did you
			get this?
			They read from it at the
			meetings... it tells the story
			of the Vulcan separation...
			You should not bring that out
			here, D'Tan. You've been told
			many times...
			I just wanted to show it to Mister
			Spock...
			Off with you... we will see you
			later tonight...
			Will you tell us more stories
			about Vulcan?
			Yes...
			Jolan True.
			Perhaps this is not such a good
			place to talk...
			So, what do you think of your
			enemy, Captain Picard?
			These people are no one's enemy,
			Senator.
			Many of my colleagues fear what
			they have to say. But I have
			learned to listen carefully.
			Children like D'Tan are our
			future. Old men like me will not
			be able to hold on to ancient
			prejudice and hostility. These
			young people won't allow it.
			Now that they've met their first
			real Vulcan, it has only inspired
			them more. I'm sure that is
			evident to you, Spock...
			I did not anticipate such a
			passionate response to my arrival.
			Romulans are a passionate people,
			Spock. The Vulcans will learn
			to appreciate that quality in us.
			If we are successful.
			We will know soon. The Proconsul
			has agreed to meet with you.
			First Officer's log, stardate
			45245.8. The Enterprise remains
			at Qualor Two as we continue to
			investigate the theft of a surplus
			Vulcan ship and materiel.
			The trail has led us to the former
			wife of a deceased smuggler.
			A new face.
			Same one I've always had.
			What would you like to hear?
			Know the blues?
			Look at me, Mister. What do you
			think?
			Seven different shades of them.
			How about some Andorian blues?
			Suck salt?
			Never cared for it.
			Good for you. Nasty habit. So
			who are you looking for?
			Who says I'm looking for anybody?
			Your face. Your uniform. In a
			place like this.
			Okay. I'm looking for you.
			You just made my day.
			I have to ask you about your
			husband.
			Well, it was nice while it lasted.
			Which husband?
			The dead one, I'm afraid.
			You must be from the Enterprise.
			You destroyed his ship.
			He fired first.
			He always did.
			He was involved in some pretty
			bad business. And he took the
			evidence with him.
			His one endearing quality -- he
			always cleaned up after himself.
			What do you want from me?
			I was hoping you might know his
			business partners.
			Why should I help you?
			To be honest, I can't think of
			a good reason.
			Well, you did kill my ex-husband.
			That's not a bad start. Why don't
			you drop a few coins in the jar.
			I'll see what I remember.
			I don't carry money.
			You don't offer much do you... ?
			Slide over.
			Huh?
			Just what I need -- another set
			of hands.
			You know this one?
			Early 20th century, from a place
			on Earth called Memphis...
			... maybe I could teach you a new
			lick or two...
			You already have.
			So, whattaya say?
			Gonna be around a few days?
			I can be.
			Sooner or later, a man named Omag
			will come by for a song. Always
			wants to hear the same thing --
			"Melor Famagal." He's an arms
			trader. A fat Ferengi.
			Enter.
			Proconsul...
			Yes... Pardek... come in...
			Ambassador Spock of Vulcan...
			Proconsul.
			Please. I've never liked titles
			since I was a lowly uhlan in the
			Romulan guard... I am Neral...
			now, how is it again, Pardek's
			tried to show me...
			I am honored.
			Good.
			Permit me to withdraw.
			Will we see you and your wife
			tommorrow at the state dinner?
			We're looking forward to it.
			It's been years since old Pardek
			was invited to an official
			function. He's far too attached
			to the "common man" for most
			peoples' comfort.
			That is their loss. I've always
			found Pardek to have a unique
			insight into many issues.
			Let me tell you something, Spock.
			We're going to start something
			here, you and I, that will redraw
			the face of the quadrant.
			You are prepared to support
			reunification?
			I believe it must eventually come.
			Our two worlds need each other.
			Forgive me. But I did not expect
			to hear a Romulan Proconsul speak
			like a member of your
			underground.
			I want you to know exactly where
			I stand.
			Do you believe you can gain the
			support of the full Senate?
			Things are not what they once were
			in the Senate. The old leaders
			have lost the respect of the
			people.
			Involvement in the Klingon War...
			endless confrontations with the
			Federation...
			They're tired of it. Times are
			changing. Leaders who refuse to
			change with them... will no
			longer be leaders.
			Spock, I am prepared to publicly
			endorse the opening of talks
			between our peoples... How do
			you think the Vulcan people will
			respond to that?
			They will be... cautious. There
			are generations of distrust to
			overcome.
			But surely with a man of your
			influence leading the way...
			Proconsul, the Senate has been
			recalled into session...
			Very well.
			Can we meet again tommorrow?
			As you wish.
			Good. Jolan True, Spock. Oh...
			Live long and prosper.
			It's everything we could have
			hoped for...
			It is more than we could have
			hoped for.
			But if Neral is ready to publicly
			endorse reunification...
			I can't imagine that one rises
			to the position of Senate
			Proconsul without the support of
			the Romulan traditionalists.
			That's true.
			Then, how can he turn his back
			on them so easily? How can he
			endorse reunification when it is
			considered subversive?
			Because he's not afraid of
			them... because he knows we will
			support him...
			Captain Picard is correct. It
			is not logical for the Proconsul
			to endorse reunification at this
			time.
			Why would Neral lie?
			Perhaps they are hoping to use
			this to expose members of your
			movement...
			No, this is our chance for
			acceptance. Finally, to be heard.
			I believe it is the Federation
			that fears an alliance between
			Romulus and Vulcan.
			That is not true...
			I came here to determine the
			potential for reunification.
			In spite of what has occurred,
			I intend to continue my efforts!
			I intend to meet with the
			Proconsul as planned.
			You let their emotions sway you...
			On the contrary, I am pursuing
			the most logical course...
			You are as skeptical as I am...
			is it logical to ignore your own
			good sense... ?
			I fear the influence of Sarek has
			colored your attitudes, Captain.
			Toward reunification. And perhaps
			toward me.
			That is the second time you have
			accused me of speaking with
			another man's voice.
			Yes, he will always be a part of
			me. His experiences. His spirit.
			But I speak with my own voice,
			Spock. Not his.
			Curious.
			That I should hear him so clearly
			now that he is dead.
			It is possible that I have brought
			my arguments with Sarek to you,
			Captain. If so, I apologize.
			Is it so important for you to win
			one last argument with him?
			No, it is not.
			Although it is true that I will
			miss... the arguments. It was,
			finally, all that we had.
			Your fight with Sarek is over.
			And you have none with me.
			I always had a different vision
			than my father... an ability to
			see beyond pure logic. He
			considered it... weak. But I
			have discovered it to be a source
			of extraordinary strength.
			Sarek would find this mission
			of reunification a fool's
			errand... But somehow I think
			it is not. Logic cannot explain
			why... but I know I must continue
			to pursue this...
			Even if it leads you into a
			Romulan trap...
			If the Romulans do have an
			ulterior motive, it would be in
			the interests of all concerned
			to determine what it is.
			So I will play the role they would
			have me play.
			Have you had any success, Mister
			Data?
			Negative, Captain. The Romulan
			Information Net employs a
			progressive encryption lock...
			I have been unable to penetrate
			their security measures.
			May I assist you, Commander? I've
			had some experience in these
			matters.
			By all means, Ambassador.
			The Romulans have incorporated
			a forty-three part cipher key into
			their entry sequence...
			Yessir, the twenty-ninth is the
			only one I cannot bypass...
			I think I'll take this opportunity
			to remove my ears...
			He intrigues me, this Picard.
			In what manner?
			He is remarkably analytical and
			dispassionate for a Human. I
			understand why my father would
			choose to mind meld with him.
			There's almost a Vulcan quality
			to the man.
			Interesting. I have never
			considered that. And Captain
			Picard has been a role model in
			my quest to be more Human.
			To be more Human?
			Yes, Ambassador.
			Fascinating.
			You have an efficient intellect,
			superior physical skills and no
			emotional impediments. There are
			Vulcans who aspire all their
			lives to achieve what you were
			given by design.
			You are half Human...
			Yes.
			And yet you have chosen a Vulcan
			way of life...
			I have.
			In effect, you have abandoned what
			I have sought all my life.
			I believe I have isolated the
			twenty-ninth cipher access code...
			I'll attempt to access the
			proconsul's files...
			Ambassador, may I ask a personal
			question?
			Please.
			As you examine your life, do you
			find you have missed your
			humanity?
			I have no regrets.
			"No regrets." That is a Human
			expression.
			Fascinating.
			Do you know any Klingon opera?
			I don't get a lot of requests for
			it.
			Surely, you must know at least
			one theme from "Aktuh and
			Maylota".
			I may be a little rusty...
			MAYLOTA... MAAAY-LOT-A...
			What is that dreadful noise? It
			sounds like a Bardakian pronghorn
			moose...
			You know what I want to hear.
			Worf to Enterprise.
			Go ahead.
			A fat Ferengi has just entered
			the establishment.
			Is that "Melor Famagal" I hear?
			It is.
			I'm on my way.
			Where is the waiter? Is there
			no waiter in this sorry place?
			Is there a problem?
			Yes. I need more napkins.
			Use your sleeve.
			What did you say?
			Or use her sleeve, I don't care.
			Who are you?
			Commander William Riker, the
			U.S.S. Enterprise.
			Am I supposed to stand up and
			salute?
			We're investigating the
			disappearance of a Vulcan ship...
			You've got the wrong Ferengi...
			I never trade in Vulcan ships...
			We know you were involved...
			Who would want a Vulcan ship...
			Vulcans are pacifists... I deal
			in warships... can somebody get
			me a napkin... ?
			Who would want a Vulcan ship?
			Hypothetically speaking?
			Hypothetically speaking.
			I never learned to speak
			hypothetical.
			Are you crazy?
			Let me explain what's going to
			happen if you don't tell me about
			that Vulcan ship. Your passage
			rights through this sector will
			be revoked. But more than that,
			I'll be very unhappy.
			I delivered it to a Barolian
			freighter...
			At what coordinates?
			I don't remember.
			Ow... watch it... you're
			stretching my neck...
			Coordinates?
			At Galorndon Core. Near the
			Neutral Zone. That's all I know.
			I swear it.
			Enjoy your dinner.
			As soon as I heard this Barolian
			ship was at Galorndon Core, I
			started to think Romulans...
			And the Romulans are suddenly very
			interested in bonding with the
			Vulcans... Spock has been meeting
			with the new Senate Proconsul
			about reunification...
			Reunification... ?
			The Proconsul says he is prepared
			to endorse peace talks...
			And Spock?
			The Ambassador is skeptical but
			he cares a great deal about
			reunification. As long as there's
			a chance of success, he will
			pursue it.
			I'm afraid I don't see where a
			stolen Vulcan ship fits into all
			this...
			Neither do I, Counselor.
			How soon can you be at Galorndon
			Core, Number One... ?
			Little over eight hours.
			It may be a wild goose chase, but
			I don't think we have a choice,
			do you?
			Agreed.
			We're losing our Romulan carrier
			wave, sir...
			We'll advise you further when you
			get there, Number One. Picard
			out.
			Ensign, set a course to Galordon
			Core, take us to warp eight.
			Captain, the Romulan subspace logs
			identify a transmission from the
			Romulan surface to a Barolian ship
			near Galorndon Core twelve hours
			ago.
			Galorndon Core is along the
			Barolian trade route... They
			trade a great deal with the
			Romulans... it's probably just
			routine...
			This would not appear to be
			routine. I have been able to
			trace the source of the
			transmission. It incorporates
			the code prefix of Romulan
			intelligence.
			Can you access it, Data?
			It appears to be a short sequence
			of numbers. One four zero zero.
			Nothing else?
			Nossir.
			I want to advise the Ambassador
			immediately... Mister Data, you
			will accompany me to the
			surface...
			Captain, maintain an emergency
			transport schedule at our beam-in
			coordinates...
			I do not take orders from you,
			Picard.
			P'tah Jol Ginquol! Katah! You
			will lock on those coordinates
			at sixty minute intervals after
			our arrival.
			That was not very Vulcan of you,
			sir.
			Mister Spock... I've been looking
			for you...
			I have been meeting with the
			Proconsul, D'Tan...
			Does he still speak of
			reunification?
			He speaks of nothing else.
			Have you ever seen any of these?
			The syllabic nucleus of the Vulcan
			language...
			They were my toys when I was
			small...
			Your parents wanted you to learn
			the Vulcan language?
			As did their parents before them.
			To prepare for the day when we
			will live again with our Vulcan
			cousins.
			Your Federation friends have
			returned. They must see you
			immediately. I've told Pardek...
			he will meet you at the cave...
			The only communication that was
			sent were the numbers one-four-
			zero-zero.
			What does it mean?
			It means that the Proconsul has
			apparently been attempting to
			deceive me.
			For what purpose I cannot say yet.
			But his conversations with me have
			obviously been part of a greater
			plan involving the stolen Vulcan
			ship.
			How do you know that, Ambassador?
			The time the Proconsul has set
			for the subspace announcement of
			our peace initiative is fourteen
			hundred hours tomorrow. One four
			zero zero.
			But why would they need a Vulcan
			ship... ?
			That will become clear very
			shortly...
			Captain Picard, welcome to
			Romulus. I trust you've enjoyed
			your visit. And this is the
			android I have come to respect
			in battle...
			Lieutenant Commander Data.
			How could they know of this
			location? Someone betrayed us...
			Yes. You did.
			Spock, we've been friends for
			eighty years...
			It is the only logical conclusion.
			You invited me to Romulus. You
			arranged the meeting with the
			Proconsul. And you knew that
			Picard and Data had returned to
			the surface with new information.
			The great Spock. Very well.
			Senator Pardek, your service to
			the Romulan people is noted and
			appreciated.
			Jolan True, Spock.
			Do not be distressed. Your dream
			of reunification is not dead.
			It will only take a slightly
			different form... the Romulan
			conquest of Vulcan.
			Any signs of life, Mister La
			Forge?
			Negative, Commander.
			The Romulans could have a cloaked
			base on the surface...
			Or anywhere else along the Neutral
			Zone.
			Sir, a coded subspace signal from
			Romulus... it's the Captain...
			What...
			"Maintain position at Galorndon
			Core. Diplomatic initiative
			appears to be succeeding. Will
			advise soon."
			The message did employ the proper
			code sequence, Commander.
			Yeah. I'm sure it did.
			Come in, gentlemen. Take a seat,
			please.
			Excuse me, I'm just finishing up
			a speech. For you, Mister Spock.
			I rather enjoy writing. I don't
			get to do it often in this job...
			Perhaps you would be happier in
			another job.
			Please feel free to change any
			words that you wish... I've tried
			to make it sound Vulcan, a lot
			of unnecessarily long words...
			In a few hours, you will deliver
			this statement alongside our
			Senate Proconsul... It will
			announce to the Vulcan people that
			a peace envoy is on its way from
			Romulus... we will transmit it
			on all Federation subspace
			frequencies...
			A "peace" envoy in a stolen Vulcan
			ship...
			Actually, three Vulcan ships,
			Captain... The Enterprise is only
			aware of the one we stole from
			Qualor Two. We've been following
			their investigation. It has
			forced us to make some minor
			changes. Including a message that
			was sent in your name, ordering
			them to stay where they are.
			The moment those Vulcan ships
			appear in the Neutral Zone, the
			Enterprise will move to
			intercept...
			In that event, the Enterprise
			will be given more important
			matters to attend to. In the
			meantime, Ambassador Spock will
			be telling his people to welcome
			the peace envoy. And when they do,
			our forces will seize control
			before anyone realizes what has
			happened.
			Can you possibly believe that
			the Federation will not
			immediately intervene?
			Of course it will. And we're
			fully prepared for it. But we'll
			be there. Entrenched. And it
			will be very difficult to get us
			out once we are. A new Vulcan
			government will be formed that
			will embrace their Romulan
			cousins. Reunification will
			become a fact of life.
			I will not read this or any other
			statement.
			If you do not, you will die; all
			of you will die.
			It is logical to conclude that
			you will kill us in any event.
			Therefore, I choose not to
			cooperate.
			I hate Vulcans. I hate the logic.
			I hate the arrogance. Very
			well...
			Computer, holographic program
			Spock One...
			By taking advantage of holographic
			sampling during the last several
			days, we have created a
			programmable Spock...
			Run program!
			This is Ambassador Spock of
			Vulcan. By now, Federation
			sensors are tracking three Vulcan
			ships crossing the Neutral Zone.
			These ships carry the future of
			the Vulcan and Romulan people.
			Our long conflict is finally
			over...
			Freeze.
			We would have preferred an
			interactive Spock who could have
			responded to questions, but this
			will have to suffice...
			This will hardly convince anyone.
			I don't need to convince them.
			Just to confuse them long enough
			for us to reach Vulcan.
			End program.
			If you will excuse me, it is time
			to send the ships on their
			journey...
			Suggestions?
			Commander Data, are they still
			unaware that we have access to
			their computers?
			I believe so, sir.
			Then perhaps you and I can find
			a way to create a diversion...
			Commander, sensors are picking
			up three vessels crossing the
			neutral zone... Vulcan ships...
			Vulcan...
			What's their heading, Mister
			Worf... ?
			One-four-three mark zero one
			two...
			That would put them on a course
			to Vulcan... they don't seem to
			be in any hurry... they're only
			moving at warp one, Commander...
			Worf, signal them on subspace...
			request their status... Geordi,
			see if you can tell if one of them
			is the ship we've been looking
			for.
			They say they're escorting a peace
			envoy from Romulus to Vulcan,
			sir... They request that we
			monitor Federation subspace
			channels. Ambassador Spock will
			be making an announcement
			shortly...
			Perhaps his reunification talks
			were successful...
			Geordi?
			None of the transponder
			signatures match up to the
			missing ship, Commander. They
			might have been altered... I'll
			keep checking...
			Set a course to intercept...
			Sir, the captain's orders were
			to maintain...
			I know the captain's orders,
			Lieutenant. Engage.
			Impossible... there's no way they
			could have gotten out of this
			room...
			That's far enough...
			Hold it right there. Drop your
			weapons.
			How did you get in here?
			Drop your weapons.
			Drop your weapons.
			Cease fire.
			Holograms...
			I'm afraid I don't know too much
			about Romulan disruptor
			settings...
			"Cowboy diplomacy".
			Well done, Mister Data...
			although I believe you parted
			Commander Riker's hair on the
			wrong side.
			I will be more observant in the
			future, sir.
			It doesn't matter what you do now.
			Spock's announcement will be made
			in minutes. Our forces will be
			on Vulcan before you can alert
			anyone...
			We've just received a priority
			one distress call from the colony
			on Dulisian Four... a massive
			failure of the environmental
			support system. They're going
			to require evacuation.
			Worf, other ships in the vicinity
			of Dulisian Four...
			One, sir... a Rutian
			archaeological vessel...
			I'm sure it's not equipped to
			handle something of this scale,
			Will...
			Geordi, anything more on the
			Vulcan ships... ?
			I've checked every sensor display
			backwards and forwards... if the
			Romulans altered them, they didn't
			leave any fingerprints... I can't
			tie any of them to the surplus
			yard.
			The Vulcan ships have entered
			Federation space... maintaining
			low warp, sir...
			Lay in a new course for Dulisian
			Four...
			Incoming Message from Romulus...
			on all subspace channels.
			On screen.
			This is Ambassador Spock of
			Vulcan. By now, Federation
			sensors are tracking three Vulcan
			ships crossing the Neutral Zone.
			These ships carry a Romulan
			invasion force and must be
			stopped. I repeat these ships.
			Doctor, contact Dulisian Four...
			and confirm that distress call.
			I have a feeling it may prove
			to be a false alarm.
			How long will it take to intercept
			those Vulcan ships, Mister Worf?
			Fourteen minutes, sir...
			Communication lines have been
			terminated at the transmitter...
			I am quite certain the message
			was sent prior to the
			interruption...
			Well done, Mister Data...
			You'll never get out of this
			building.
			I disagree, Commander. After
			studying the design of this
			structure, I have determined that
			our best route of escape would
			be the underground exit to the
			east of this wing... I have
			disconnected certain security
			scanners to assist us.
			I am afraid we cannot permit you
			to warn your guards.
			Impressive.
			Vulcan defense vessels are also
			responding... the Romulan force
			is retreating toward the Neutral
			Zone...
			Uh Uh. They're not taking those
			Vulcan ships home with them...
			Visual range, Commander...
			On screen.
			A Romulan warbird. Decloaking
			alongside the Vulcan ships.
			Red alert...
			Advise the warbird to withdraw
			from Federation space and leave
			the Vulcan ships where they are...
			The warbird is powering up its
			forward disruptor array...
			Ready phasers.
			There were over two thousand
			Romulan troops on those ships.
			They destroyed their own invasion
			force.
			Rather than let them be taken
			prisoner.
			Stand down red alert. Mister
			Worf, advise the Klingon ship to
			signal us as soon as Captain
			Picard and Data are safely aboard.
			Aye, sir...
			This way... Pardek never saw these
			caves... It's safe, they won't
			find us here...
			What will you do now... ?
			What we've always done. Continue
			to teach. Pass on the ideals to
			a new generation. Work for the
			day when new thoughts may be
			spoken aloud.
			The Federation will welcome that
			day.
			Captain, we will need to reach
			our transport site in fourteen
			minutes.
			I will not be coming with you.
			Ambassador...
			The reason for my coming here has
			never been more clear, Captain.
			The union of the Romulan and
			Vulcan peoples will not be
			achieved by politics. Or by
			diplomacy. But it will be
			achieved. The answer has been
			here in front of us all the time.
			An inexorable evolution toward
			a Vulcan philosophy has already
			begun: Like the first Vulcans,
			these people are struggling to
			find a new enlightenment. It may
			take decades, centuries for them
			to reach it... but they will...
			and I must help...
			I have learned it is useless to
			argue with you once your mind is
			set.
			Not at all, Captain. I have in
			fact found our arguments quite
			useful. Almost as useful as those
			I had with my father.
			Would you be surprised to learn
			that he found them equally
			valuable?
			Ironically, Captain, you may have
			known Sarek better than his own
			son did... my father and I never
			chose to meld.
			Then, I would offer you the chance
			to touch what he shared with
			me...
