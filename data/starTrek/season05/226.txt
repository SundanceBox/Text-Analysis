			Captain's log, stardate 45959.1.
			The Enterprise has been recalled
			to sector zero zero one on a
			priority mission.
			All we've been told is that
			evidence has been discovered
			indicating the presence of
			extraterrestrials on Earth...
			five centuries ago.
			Work crews were down here
			installing seismic regulators when
			they found some remarkable
			artifacts...
			And it's been determined that they
			date back to the late nineteenth
			century... ?
			The biofocal vision aide is
			typical of the era... the weapon
			is a forty-five caliber single
			action cavalry pistol invented
			by Colt Firearms in 1873.
			Look inside the watch.
			What makes you think
			extraterrestrials are related to
			this discovery...
			The crew was having a problem with
			the regulators... something in
			the cavern was interfering with
			the phase conditioners... it
			turned out to be the cavern
			itself... do you have a tricorder,
			Commander?
			The composition of the exposed
			rockface has been altered by
			exposure to triolic waves...
			Which you're not going to find
			on Earth... in either the
			nineteenth or twenty-fourth
			century...
			Triolic waves?
			The byproduct of an energy
			source employed by very few
			species because of its deleterious
			effects on living tissue...
			We've confirmed that no one has
			been in or out of this cavern in
			centuries... so we're left with
			a five-hundred-year-old mystery.
			I'm curious, Doctor. There are
			far greater experts on Earth who
			could investigate your mystery.
			Why bring the Enterprise all the
			way home?
			As we continued our excavation,
			we found one other thing I haven't
			shown you yet...
			We've tried to leave everything
			as we found it...
			Captain's log, stardate 45960.2.
			We have transported the materials
			discovered in the cavern back to
			the ship for analysis. I wish I
			could be as dispassionate about
			the implications as my second
			officer...
			Interesting... there has been a
			twelve percent decomposition of
			the bitanium in the neural pathway
			links... it suggests the alloys
			are vulnerable to...
			Data...
			Yessir... ?
			How can you look inside that...
			and analyze the decomposition...
			without... without...
			Emotion, sir?
			... without, I don't know...
			I am simply trying to make an
			objective assessment.
			Is it... yours, Data?
			I am quite certain that it is,
			Captain.
			Could it be Lore?
			My brother's positronic brain had
			a type L phase-discriminating
			amplifier... mine is type R.
			Type R?
			Yessir.
			Can you determine how long it has
			been in the cavern?
			As I was going to say, the
			decomposition strongly indicates
			that life was terminated
			approximately five hundred years
			ago. That would be consistent
			with the other artifacts recovered.
			Your head is not an artifact.
			In relative terms, perhaps not.
			Nevertheless, it seems clear that
			my life is to end in the late
			nineteenth century.
			Not if we can help it.
			There is nothing anyone can do
			to prevent it, sir.
			At some future date, I will be
			transported back to nineteenth
			century Earth... where I will die.
			It has occurred. It will occur.
			I can't tell you exactly who the
			aliens were... but I have found
			out a few things...
			The triolicized rock face tells
			us we're probably dealing with
			a species with microcentrum cell
			membranes. Triolic waves
			wouldn't harm them. Also might
			mean they're shape shifters of
			some kind...
			So they could have appeared as
			Humans on Earth...
			I don't think it's anyone we've
			run into before... nothing we
			found matches up with any known
			lifeform...
			What does match up... is a
			cellular fossil that might have
			just come along for the ride...
			Cellular fossil... ?
			A microscopic ciliated
			lifeform... not that different
			from a thousand other single cell
			lifeforms that you'd find on any
			planet surface... except this
			particular one is
			L-B-one-zero-four-four-five...
			and L-B-one-zero-four-four-five
			is only known to exist on one
			planet... Devidia Two in the
			Marrab sector...
			Number One, lay in a course...
			Aye, sir...
			So?
			I have no reference point by which
			your question can be answered.
			So... do you feel like talking
			about it?
			Are you referring to the
			foreknowledge of my death?
			Yeah.
			I have no particular desire to
			discuss the matter.
			Do you feel like talking about
			it?
			Yeah.
			Why?
			Data... it's gotta bother you
			a little...
			On the contrary, I find it
			rather... comforting.
			Comforting...
			I have often wondered about my
			own mortality as I have seen
			others age around me... Until now,
			it has been theoretically possible
			that I would live an unlimited
			period of time. And although
			some might find this attractive,
			to me it only reinforces the fact
			that I am... artificial.
			I never realized... how tough all
			this must be for you...
			"Tough"?
			Knowing that you would outlive
			all your friends.
			I expected to make new friends.
			True.
			And then outlive them as well.
			Now that you know you might not...
			... it provides a sense of
			completion to my future. In a
			way, I am not so different from
			anyone else. I can now look
			forward to death.
			I never thought of it that way.
			One might even conclude that it
			brings me one step closer to being
			Human. I am mortal.
			Picard to bridge officers...
			we're approaching the Devidia
			system... report to your
			stations...
			See you later... let's get
			together for a game of chess or
			something, okay?
			Looked like quite an intense
			discussion.
			Yeah... talking about life, death,
			the future...
			Somebody getting married?
			Naw. Somebody's gonna die.
			Die?
			They found Data's head a mile
			below San Francisco... been down
			there for five centuries...
			That's why the Enterprise was sent
			back to Earth... I didn't
			realize...
			Yeah, something, isn't it?
			He seems fine about it... better
			than I am...
			I better get to engineering...
			Full circle.
			I heard about Data.
			Yeah.
			It's having an unusually traumatic
			effect on everyone.
			Yeah.
			If you don't want to talk about
			it, it's okay.
			I'm fine. I'm just...
			...angry.
			No not angry.
			Yeah, angry. Why should I be
			angry?
			Maybe it reminds us all of our
			own mortality.
			I just don't want to believe it.
			Have you ever heard Data define
			friendship?
			No...
			How did he put it... something
			like...
			"As I experience certain sensory
			input patterns my mental pathways
			become accustomed to them. The
			inputs eventually are anticipated
			and even 'missed' when absent."
			You do that very well. So what's
			the point?
			He's "used" to us... and we're
			"used" to him... it's like finding
			out someone you love has a terminal
			illness and...
			Data...
			Counselor. Commander.
			Would either of you mind if I made
			a personal inquiry?
			Personal inquiry? No, go right
			ahead.
			I am perceiving an apparent change
			in the way that others act toward
			me. For example, people abruptly
			end their conversations when I
			appear... as you did when the
			turbolift doors opened. Is this
			an accurate observation?
			Yes.
			You're right, Data. And it's not
			a very nice thing to do.
			It's just that our mental pathways
			have... become accustomed to your...
			sensory input patterns...
			I understand. I am fond of you
			too, Commander.
			We're in orbit.
			Any sign of life?
			Negative.
			Sir, sensors are picking up
			unusual temporal disturbances on
			a small area of the planet's
			surface... forty-two degrees,
			seven minutes north by eighty-eight
			degrees declination east.
			Temporal disturbances...
			Take us into a standard orbit
			above those coordinates...
			Spectral analysis shows a high
			level of triolic waves emanating
			from the same location.
			Do they correlate with your
			readings from Earth, Data?
			Affirmative, sir... the magnetic
			signature is identical to the one
			found in the cavern.
			Would these triolic waves be
			dangerous to humanoids?
			Only with longterm exposure.
			There is no immediate threat.
			Take an away team.
			Worf...
			Riker to La Forge. Meet the away
			team in transporter room three...
			Aye, sir...
			Commander...
			Mister Data, I'll need you on the
			bridge to monitor the sensor
			readings during this
			investigation...
			Captain, may I speak to you alone?
			Sir, it is established procedure
			that the second officer
			accompanies the away...
			Yes, yes I am aware of that...
			Then I must assume that this
			decision is related to the
			discovery on Earth of...
			I see no reason why we shouldn't
			take reasonable precautions...
			Captain, no disrespect intended,
			but there is no rational
			justification for such a course...
			Then, I shall be irrational.
			It is possible, sir, that the
			events leading to my death may
			not begin for years... even
			centuries.
			I hope that's true, Data.
			Nevertheless, this investigation
			began with your death... I am
			simply trying to see that it
			doesn't end the same way.
			While I appreciate your concern,
			sir, if I may employ an
			aphorism, one cannot cheat fate.
			Cheat fate... ? Perhaps we can't,
			Mister Data. But, to be honest,
			I don't think I could forgive
			myself... if we didn't at least
			give it a try.
			The concentration of triolic waves
			falls off about here...
			It increases exponentially the
			closer in we go...
			What's the source? Is there
			something underground?
			Negative, Commander.
			Then what's the explanation?
			Don't have one yet.
			LaForge to Enterprise.
			Go ahead.
			Run a spectral field correlation
			for me... see if these triolic
			readings are directly related to
			the temporal distortions...
			Acknowledged.
			Deanna...
			There is life here... a child...
			an old woman... dozens more...
			dozens... hundreds... terrified...
			Terrified... ?
			My God... they're Human.
			Troi's convinced they're human...
			they may be trapped somehow...
			we're not sure...
			Captain, the results of my
			temporal analysis may be
			pertinent...
			It indicates a synchronic
			distortion in the areas emanating
			triolic waves...
			That explains a few things. How
			much, Data?
			A positive displacement of point
			zero-zero-four percent.
			Whatever or whoever's there...
			is out of phase with us... But
			we're only talking about a
			fraction of a second...
			A fraction of a second would make
			them invisible?
			A millisecond, a year... it
			wouldn't make any difference...
			If what we're reading is accurate,
			we're occupying the same space...
			but in a different time...
			How do we compensate?
			Commander, we might be able to
			manipulate the synchronic
			distortion...
			Maybe. If we created a contained
			subspace forcefield. But to get a
			point zero-zero-four variance,
			we'd need an incredibly sensitive
			phase discriminator, Data... I
			don't think we've got one that
			would come close...
			Yes, we do. It is built into my
			positronic decompiler.
			It would be necessary for me to
			join the away team, Captain.
			Proceed.
			Mister Data...
			Sir.
			Let me give you a hand here,
			Data...
			Once I have adjusted the
			forcefield, I will no longer be
			visible, Commander... however,
			I have taken steps to ensure that
			you will still be able to hear
			me. If you would assist me in
			a test of the com system...
			My voice will be transmitted on
			a delay correlated to the phase
			adjustment... it should allow me
			to maintain verbal contact...
			Will we be able to talk to you?
			Nossir, that will not be possible.
			You're ready to go...
			Subspace field is established...
			Adjusting for synchronic
			distortion... point zero-zero-one...
			Point zero-zero-two... point
			zero-zero-three... point zero-zero
			four...
			I have made visual contact...
			There are lifeforms here...
			They are either unaware of me or
			choosing to ignore me... I am
			moving approximately ten meters
			north of my starting position
			to observe more closely...
			They range from two to three
			meters in height... silver-gray
			in color... they have four
			limbs... no eyes or ears
			are noticeable...
			... there is a single orifice where
			a humanoid forehead would
			ordinarily be. They are reclined
			against the rockface... surrounding
			an apparatus of some sort...
			approximately one-point-five meters
			in height...
			An apparatus?
			It is releasing what appear to
			be energy fragments... which
			are then ingested by the entities
			through their orifice... perhaps
			some sort of nourishment...
			The upper portion of the
			apparatus seems to be a holding
			facility for the energy
			segments... there are hundreds,
			perhaps thousands of these
			fragments inside.
			I have resumed a northern
			direction... There is no evidence
			yet of Humans...
			Okay, enough, Data... come on
			back now...
			I have encountered another
			lifeform... an ophidian...
			it seems to be restricted
			by a forcefield...
			Two of the silver-gray entities
			are approaching it... they have
			released the forcefield...
			...temporal... massive... the
			ophidian is capable of...
			...Caught... attempting to...
			Data!
			Commander Riker, report!
			We've lost him.
			Pardon me. I am searching for
			two individuals with an ophidian.
			I beg your pardon -- a snake.
			Frenchman.
			Could you help out a Forty-Niner?
			I fell down a shaft...
			And got blown up in a tunnel...
			That is unfortunate.
			Most unfortunate. I require large
			quantites of whiskey as a
			linament.
			I am sorry but I have no whiskey
			to give you.
			I'll take a dime.
			I am sorry. But I have no form
			of legal tender.
			We're both in the same boat, eh?
			This is my corner. Go find your
			own.
			I would be happy to do so.
			However, I am presently in need
			of information.
			The stockbrokers are cheap as hell
			-- don't even ask 'em. Best
			handout is a young man with his
			lady. You give him a chance to
			impress her by bein' generous.
			But stay clear of the sailors --
			likely as not, you'll get a fist
			across the jaw for your trouble.
			Thank you for the advice, but I
			am trying to find two individuals
			with a snake.
			A snake? You're an odd fellow,
			aren't you? Best not be too
			particular about who you're
			requesting funds from --
			You require medical attention.
			I will find a doctor --
			No.
			It's too late for that...
			Help a Forty-Niner...
			Put it on Gentleman Jim. K.O.
			in the fifth.
			I require temporary lodging.
			Looks like the missus booted you
			out in the middle of the night.
			I understand the source of your
			misperception.
			But this is not sleepware. And
			I have no... missus.
			I am a Frenchman.
			Everybody's from somewhere. That
			doesn't matter at this hotel.
			It's six bits a day or four
			dollars a week.
			I have no money.
			Now that matters...
			I am capable of performing a
			significant range of tasks -- both
			mental and physical. Perhaps your
			hotel could offer me... a job.
			Well, I don't know. We got a maid
			we're pretty happy with. The
			cook's decent. The dishwasher's
			drunk all day but at least he
			shows up on time. And then
			there's me -- I do everything
			else.
			Sorry.
			Lady Luck not with ya, tonight,
			Mister Lane?
			Hasn't filled a straight in five
			weeks.
			Poker?
			Fold.
			Go to Blazes!
			A poker face carved in marble.
			What'd ya have?
			Mind you, sir. It's a gentleman's
			prerogative to divulge a bluff.
			Our friend wishes to remain
			cryptic. I believe it proper to
			respect that wish...
			The devil take you all...
			What in hell do you want?
			I would like to join your game.
			Pale... face.
			Don't like Easterners, personally.
			I am a Frenchman.
			Ah. Mes parents sont originaires
			de Bourgogne. Je suis ne a la
			New Orleans.
			Alors nous sommes presque freres.
			Je suis heureux de vous connaitre.
			Please, sir.
			The game is poker. The deal is
			yours. The ante is four bits.
			Family heirloom?
			In a manner of speaking. It is
			a crystalline composite of
			silicon, beryllium...
			Carbon-seventy, and --
			Gold.
			Gold.
			I'll give you three bucks for it.
			I accept.
			Did you see the looks on their
			faces? I did everything I could
			not to laugh.
			To whom are you referring?
			Frederick La Rouque and Joe
			Falling Hawk. Those two are card
			sharks. Oh sure, they play it
			easy at first so they don't scare
			off the marks, but give 'em enough
			time and they'll bleed a man dry
			-- especially an out-of-towner.
			What was the source of your
			jocular reaction?
			What was it you found humorous?
			Don't you see? They had you
			pegged for a sap.
			Those clothes you got on, the way
			you talk -- it's like you were
			born yesterday. You sure had them
			fooled.
			It was not my intention to
			deceive.
			Have it your way.
			This is the place. Breakfast is
			from six to eight. Checkout's
			at noon when you're ready to
			leave.
			Thank you.
			It has been a pleasure.
			It would be advisable to monitor
			that cough. I have read that
			there is currently an epidemic
			of cholera in San Francisco...
			Never felt better.
			Of course. The gratuity.
			Thank you for your assistance.
			A dollar!
			You are welcome.
			If there's anything you need --
			it can get lonely in San
			Francisco. You might want some
			company. I can introduce you to
			Lillian.
			I have no need for companionship.
			However, I do require some...
			supplies.
			Anything you need, I can get it
			for you wholesale... I can get
			it for you less than wholesale
			if you don't ask me where it came
			from...
			What do you need all this stuff
			for?
			I am an inventor...
			No kidding... well this is gonna
			take a while. I'll hafta go clear
			cross town.
			And it's not gonna be cheap.
			You may retain the surplus for
			yourself.
			Keep the change?
			Exactly.
			Done.
			Help out a Forty-Niner...
			Fell down shaft... Forty-Niner...
			Help me... Help me out...
			No...
			No...
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Close-range sensor analysis has
			yielded no further trace of
			Commander Data. Despite the
			emotional repercussions among my
			crew, I must move this mission
			forward.
			I'm not willing to accept that
			he's dead and leave it at that...
			Mister Data cannot be our
			priority...
			What's more important than Data?
			Look at what we have so far...
			evidence that these aliens have
			been travelling back in time to
			Earth...
			What if they're trying to
			undermine our history for some
			reason... ?
			Some kind of guerilla war...
			We have to operate on the
			assumption that there is a
			threat... if not to us then to
			19th-century Earth. Our first
			order of business is to determine
			what that threat may be.
			In order to do that, Mister La
			Forge, we must find a way to
			communicate with these
			life-forms...
			It's not going to be easy to
			reproduce what Data did. We can
			create a contained subspace
			field... but we'd need an
			extraordinarily sensitive phase
			discriminator to get that point
			zero-zero-four variance.
			Can you build one?
			It won't be as good as Data's...
			Will it be good enough?
			I don't know. I can try... it's
			going to take a while...
			I don't want anyone else going
			in alone.
			I should be able to create a
			subspace field large enough to
			encompass everyone. Adjusting
			the phase inside the field will
			be the hard part.
			Make it so.
			There's one thing we have to
			assume, Captain.
			That wherever he is, Data's doing
			the same thing we are... trying
			to get to the bottom of this...
			he may know a lot more about
			what's going on than we do. It
			might be in the best interests
			of this mission to find him...
			Perhaps in the course of our
			investigation we will. I hope
			so.
			If we do find Commander Data, it
			may be our fate to die with him...
			in the past. If our remains are
			in that cavern... they would have
			turned to dust long ago.
			I'm afraid to interrupt.
			Captain. You didn't have to come
			to me. I would've been happy to
			go to you.
			And let me miss all this? I
			haven't seen such a complex
			operation since the Academy lab
			final in exochemistry.
			It's a Tzartak aperitif. Very,
			very touchy.
			The trick is to change the
			evaporation point of the main
			ingredient. You want the
			temperature where the liquid goes
			to vapor to be half a degree below
			the body temperature of your
			customer.
			That way, the moment the liquid
			touches the tongue, it evaporates.
			The flavor is carried entirely
			by the vapor.
			But it's a highly delicate affair.
			A few molecules off and the vapor
			point crashes. Poof. It's gone.
			All of it.
			What did you want to see me about?
			I hear you're sending an away team
			down to the surface.
			Yes.
			Are you going along?
			This is rather unusual... for you
			to be curious about an away
			mission...
			Maybe it's an unusual away
			mission.
			Guinan, if you have something to
			tell me, I'm listening.
			Starfleet captains usually don't
			accompany away teams...
			That's general policy...
			This time you have to...
			Why?
			You just... do.
			You remember when we first met?
			Of course.
			Don't be so sure.
			What do you mean?
			I mean... if you don't go on this
			mission...
			... we didn't.
			Sorry it took so long, Mister
			Data.
			An apology is not required.
			You alright?
			I appear to have overexerted
			myself...
			I'll say.
			You got it working.
			Yes.
			Whatever it is.
			This is for your trouble.
			What are you gonna do with the
			anvil?
			I require a low intensity,
			magnetic field core. The
			iron mass of the anvil will
			provide that.
			What's it gonna be when it's
			finished?
			What do you think it is... "gonna
			be"... ?
			If I were to guess... maybe a new
			kind of motor for one of those
			horseless carriages...
			That is a good guess.
			No kiddin'. Damn. You really
			think there's money in those
			things?
			Perhaps.
			Isn't that what makes America
			great?
			To what are you referring?
			Man rides into town in his
			pajamas... wins a grub stake at
			a poker table and turns it into
			a horseless carriage and makes
			a million bucks. That's America.
			Perhaps I have given you an
			erroneous impression...
			Some day my ship's gonna come
			in...
			You have a ship?
			Oh sure... and it's fulla gold...
			I'm just biding my time til it
			gets here... raising a stake any
			way I can... I've been a newsie,
			cut fish at a cannery, I've even
			been an oyster pirate...
			That is a considerable spectrum
			of occupations.
			Can't stay in one place too
			long... I'm always looking for
			the angle, you know... say, maybe
			you and I could go into business
			selling your horseless
			carriage... you invent 'em, I
			sell 'em... I can sell anybody
			anything, whattaya say?
			I believe your plan is a bit
			premature.
			Keep it in mind though. Well,
			I better get back...
			I forgot! I got you something
			at the bakery on Third.
			Thank you, Jack.
			It's on me... partner.
			The eminent scientist, Alfred
			Russell Wallace, has revived the
			theory that Earth is at the center
			of the stellar universe.
			This distinguished natural
			philosopher has reaffirmed our
			planet as the only habitable globe
			in the Heavens. A world
			constructed, furthermore, for the
			sole benefit of man.
			He's gotten a lot of folks excited
			about the notion.
			Mister Clemens, why do I suspect
			you're not one of them?
			Your suspicions, Madam Guinan,
			are undoubtedly based upon your
			keen observational skills. Now
			if you'll permit me, I'll continue
			my character assassination
			unimpeded.
			Please do.
			According to our best geologic
			estimate, the earth is
			approximately one hundred million
			years of age. Perhaps it is less,
			perhaps more.
			Perhaps a great deal more.
			Indeed. But regardless, it is
			ancient in the extreme. Now,
			geology also tells us that Man
			himself has existed for but a
			microscopic fraction of those
			years.
			Curious, isn't it, that the world
			got by for such a great long while
			with no Humans around to take up
			space?
			I suppose Mister Wallace and his
			supporters would say the world
			needed all that time to prepare
			everything for our illustrious
			arrival.
			The oyster alone probably required
			fifteen million years to come out
			just right...
			And if the Earth isn't alone...
			If there are millions of
			inhabited planets in the
			Heavens...
			Quite my point. Man becomes a
			trivial creation, does he not?
			Lost in the vastness of the cosmic
			prairie, adrift on the deep ocean
			of time. A single one among
			countless others.
			Then again, someone might say a
			diamond is still a diamond -- even
			if it is one among millions. It
			still shines as brightly.
			Indeed, someone might say that,
			Dear Lady. If someone thought
			the Human race were akin to a
			precious jewel.
			But this increasingly hypothetical
			someone would not be me.
			Good afternoon, sir.
			Good afternoon. I would like to
			speak to Guinan.
			And you are... ?
			Data.
			Mister Data... Could it be under
			another name?
			I do not know...
			I... can't seem to find you on
			our guest list, sir.
			I am a personal friend.
			Madam Guinan has discovered many
			personal friends since the
			newspaper announcement. But if
			you're not on the guest list,
			there's nothing I can do.
			It is urgent that I see her...
			-- Sir, if you don't leave this
			house immediately, I will send
			for the police.
			That is an excellent idea. I will
			wait for them inside.
			Sir! Please!
			Guinan, I must speak with you
			immediately.
			Forgive me, madam... He's stronger
			than he looks.
			I am sorry about the disruption,
			but he did not believe me when
			I told him we were friends.
			"We?" Meaning you and me? Have
			we met, Mister...
			Data.
			Yes. We... were on a ship
			together.
			I've certainly done my share of
			travelling. What ship?
			The Enterprise.
			Is that a clipper ship?
			It is a starship.
			A starship? What registry would
			that be?
			Mister Data. Of course.
			Excuse us, but we have so much
			to catch up on...
			Let me guess. My father sent you.
			Well, you tell him I've still got
			a lot more listening to do --
			-- I was not sent by your father.
			Circumstances demand that I take
			you into my confidence. I require
			your assistance.
			I am from the future.
			Is this some kind of a joke?
			No, you don't look like the joking
			type.
			That is correct. I am from the
			twenty-fourth century, where you
			and I serve together on the same
			starship.
			Why do you need my help?
			Our ship encountered a species
			who appear to be threatening 19th-
			century Earth. I investigated,
			and was inadvertently pulled into
			their temporal vortex.
			When I saw your photograph in the
			newspaper, I assumed you had
			joined me from the future. I know
			your species is long-lived --
			but I did not realize you had
			visited Earth so long ago.
			Eavesdropping is by no means a
			proper activity for a gentleman.
			Nonetheless, the deed is done...
			Here...
			The triolic waves end... right...
			here...
			That's fine, Counselor...
			How soon will you be ready?
			I think we are, Captain...
			The subspace field is established.
			I'd feel more comfortable if you'd
			monitor us from the ship, captain.
			I have reason to believe my
			presence on this mission is
			imperative.
			Imperative?
			Yes.
			Mister Worf, you will report to
			the bridge.
			Sir... as security officer, my
			place is by your side.
			The security of the Enterprise
			is of paramount importance,
			Lieutenant.
			Yes, sir.
			Worf to Enterprise.
			Go ahead.
			Beam me up.
			Stand by.
			Proceed, Mister La Forge.
			I've modified this tricorder to
			interface with the subspace
			generator... It should allow me
			to control the phase
			discrimination... assuming it's
			going to work at all...
			I'll need everyone within the
			field...
			Adjusting for synchronic
			distortion... point-zero-zero-one...
			...point-zero-zero-two...
			point-zero-zero-three...
			Why can we see them when they
			can't see us?
			The phase displacement might not
			bring us far enough into their
			perceptual range.
			These strands appear to be
			biomagnetic... variable flux...
			they must be organic in origin...
			A life-form... ?
			No. There is no life here...
			what I have sensed is only an
			imprint, an echo from the last
			moment of life... Human life...
			they all died in terror...
			My God... they're delivering more
			of them... for the others to...
			ingest...
			Will, look at what he's
			carrying...
