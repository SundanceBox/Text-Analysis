			Captain's log, stardate 45944.1.
			We're en route to Starbase
			Two-eighteen after a magnetic wave
			survey of the Parvenium Sector.
			We will give our report directly
			to Fleet Admiral Gustafson.
			The last time I encountered
			Admiral Gustafson... I ended up
			spending nine straight hours at
			the opera.
			Nine hours... ?
			The entire "Ring" cycle at one
			sitting...
			That's a little too much Wagner
			for me.
			And for me... but not, apparently,
			for Admiral Gustafson. She went
			back the next day and sat through
			it all again. I warned her that
			this time --
			Sir, sensors detect an
			unidentified object... twenty-two
			thousand kilometers off the port
			quarter.
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Mister Data?
			It appears to be a probe of some
			kind... but there is no Starfleet
			record of this shape or design.
			Is it scanning us?
			No sir... but it has assumed a
			relative position and is holding
			course with us.
			The probe is composed of...
			paricium and talgonite... a
			ceramic alloy.
			Not a very sophisticated
			technology...
			Sir, I'm detecting a low-level
			nucleonic beam coming from the
			probe.
			Shields up; stand by phasers.
			The beam is scanning the shield's
			perimeter.
			The probe is emitting an unusual
			particle stream --
			Captain, the beam is penetrating
			our shields --
			Increase power to --
			Captain?...
			Captain, I've got you; it's
			all...
			Well.. finally.
			How are you feeling?
			Kamin... can you answer me?
			Where is this... ?
			You're still feverish...
			Computer, freeze program.
			End program.
			Picard to Enterprise --
			Kamin, please don't try to get
			up yet... you're still not well.
			I asked you... what is this place?
			This... is your home, of course.
			Where is my uniform? My
			communicator?
			I'd better call the doctor
			again...
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. I would like to speak
			with whoever is in charge here.
			If you'll just lie down, I'll brew
			you some nice warm kenomay...
			Just tell me this -- am I a
			prisoner here?
			Please, dear... you've had a high
			fever for three days... you
			mustn't push yourself too
			quickly...
			You shouldn't go outside...
			Kamin... please come back
			inside...
			This sapling is planted as an
			affirmation of life... in defiance
			of the drought and with
			expectations of long life.
			Whatever comes -- we will keep
			it alive, as a symbol of our
			survival.
			Kamin! You're back on your feet!
			How do you feel, my friend?
			Are you in charge here?
			In charge... ?
			I want to be returned to my ship
			immediately.
			What... ship is that?
			Please... if you could tell me...
			what is this place? Where am I?
			The fever... it's taken your
			memory.
			That must be it. Perhaps you
			could help me...
			Anything, my friend.
			My name is Kamin... and you are
			-- ?
			Batai...
			Council leader.
			Ah. And you say I've been ill...
			For over a week. Eline should've
			put you in the hospital, but she
			insisted on caring for you
			herself.
			Eline.
			Your wife. If you don't remember
			that, maybe it's safer not to go
			home.
			And... what is this place?
			Perhaps you should see the
			doctor...
			Please -- I'm sure it will come
			back to me...
			This... is the community of
			Ressik. Northern province.
			What planet?
			Come... let me take you back home.
			I'm really quite all right. If
			you'll just answer...
			This is the planet Kataan.
			Kataan... not a Federation
			planet.
			I think I'll take a walk...
			You've been ill for a week...
			Exercise will do me good. I'd
			like to -- re-acquaint myself with
			the surroundings.
			Thank goodness...
			I've had people out trying to find
			you everywhere. Why did you
			worry us like that?
			Are you hungry?
			Hungry, thirsty... weary... I
			suppose that proves this isn't
			a dream, doesn't it?
			You think this... your life...
			is a dream?
			It's not my life... I know that
			much.
			I've kept something hot for you.
			Where did you go?
			I walked. For hours.
			And you just out of bed...
			This is delicious...
			You always say that...
			Would you -- answer some questions
			for me? No matter how strange
			they might seem to you?
			Of course...
			Are there other planets in this
			star system? Do you visit any
			other systems... ?
			All right. Is there any kind of
			communication system here? How
			do you send messages to... to
			other communities? Other places?
			The usual way... by
			voice-transit conductors. Do
			you want to send a message?
			Yes. When can that be arranged?
			Tomorrow.
			Don't you want to ask about...
			us?
			Of course. Anything you can tell
			me would be helpful. We are...
			married?
			Three years ago... the happiest
			day of my life was the day we got
			married.
			You're probably tired of hearing
			it... but I've loved you since
			I was seven years old. That's
			when I decided I was going to be
			your wife, and no one was going
			to change my mind.
			I'm glad I was so stubborn...
			What is it that I do... here in
			Ressik?
			You're the best iron weaver in
			the community. At least I think
			so. You prefer playing the flute,
			of course.
			The flute?
			And when did I learn to play it?
			I'm afraid you've never learned,
			dear. You do keep trying.
			I see what you mean.
			Thank you for the soup. And for
			your help. Tomorrow will you help
			me send a message?
			Of course. Will you come to bed
			now?
			I'll sleep here...
			Oh, no... please come with me...
			I've been sick... I may be tossing
			and turning... it wouldn't be fair
			to you.
			Let me be the judge of that.
			Where did you get this?
			It's... the first gift you ever
			gave me.
			... I've got you; it's all right...
			Riker to sickbay. The captain's
			been hurt.
			The nucleonic beam is no longer
			scanning, Commander. There is
			a narrow reciprocating band
			focused directly on Captain
			Picard.
			Mister Data, find out how that
			beam is getting through the
			shields and what we can do to cut
			it off.
			Yes, Commander.
			Geordi, start scanning the probe
			for any identifying marks,
			anything that might tell us where
			it came from.
			Understood.
			Pulse and blood pressure
			normal... I'm getting hyperactive
			fibrogenic activity... this is
			odd...
			What is it?
			There's no evidence of injury or
			trauma... vital signs are normal,
			but his neurotransmitter
			production is off the scale.
			What's going on?
			That probe is doing something to
			him... Data, any progress?
			No, sir. The particle emission
			is most unusual. I am unable to
			block it.
			Destroy the probe. Phasers are
			armed and ready.
			I don't think that's wise. Not
			until we know exactly what it's
			doing to him...
			Agreed. Stand down phasers,
			Mister Worf.
			In the meantime, let's see if we
			can move out of range. Ensign,
			thrusters only... one hundred
			kph... nice and easy...
			Mister Data?
			The probe is moving with us,
			sir -- holding relative position.
			It's connected itself to him...
			like a tether.
			You've been dreaming of that
			starship again, haven't you?
			I'm just charting the sun's
			movements. It might give some
			clues to the cause of this
			drought.
			I think you're still trying to
			figure out where you are... where
			that ship of yours is... what you
			can do to get back to that life...
			The memory's five years old now,
			but it's still inside me.
			My other existence may be gone,
			but I still wonder about it.
			Was it so much better than this
			one?
			So much more gratifying... so much
			more fulfilling... that you cling
			to it with such stubbornness?
			Eline...
			It must have been extraordinary...
			but never once, in all the stories
			you've told me... have you
			mentioned anyone who loved you
			as I do.
			It was real... as real as this
			is. You can't expect me to forget
			the lifetime I spent there...
			Yes, I can.
			I've been patient, Kamin. For
			five years I have shared you with
			that other life.
			I have listened, I have tried to
			understand... and I have waited.
			When do I get you back?
			I know this has been hard for
			you...
			It's not as though it hasn't been
			interesting... all this talk about
			starships and distant planets...
			I have never been bored.
			But I have been lonely. Knowing
			that your heart is really...
			somewhere else.
			You have been amazingly tolerant.
			When are you going to let go?
			When are you going to start living
			this life?
			When are we going to start a
			family?
			Kamin, Eline!
			Good morning!
			Good morning, Batai...
			Are you ready? The administrator
			has already arrived.
			Yes...
			Will you come along?
			No, thank you...
			... You do very well on your own.
			She always was strong-minded.
			Even when she was a child.
			It isn't her fault. These last
			few years have been difficult for
			her.
			And for you, I think.
			There you are, Batai. Perhaps
			you can explain to me... when
			crops are dying all over, how this
			tree is flourishing?
			This tree is our symbol... our
			affirmation of life. Everyone
			in this town gives a part of their
			water rations to keep it alive.
			We have learned, Administrator,
			that hope is a powerful weapon
			against anything... even drought.
			A good point. Perhaps I will
			recommend a symbolic tree in each
			of my communities...
			Now. What business do we have
			today?
			We need help if we're to increase
			the water supply. We think there
			are ways to reclaim some of our
			water...
			Batai, you're being a bit of an
			alarmist. True, we're in a
			drought... but water rationing
			has produced a sizeable savings.
			If the weather pattern doesn't
			change, rationing won't be enough.
			We will run out of water.
			Who's this?
			Kamin, sir.
			Kamin... do I know you?
			No. I haven't spoken to you
			before.
			Well, Kamin -- I'm open to all
			the people of this town. I'm
			delighted to hear what you have
			to say. Did you have a specific
			proposal?
			I suggest we build atmospheric
			condensers which could extract
			water from the air.
			Well. Very ambitious. Kamin,
			was it? And your occupation is
			-- ?
			Iron weaving.
			And playing the flute.
			I don't mean to quash your very
			creative idea... but building
			atmospheric condensers would be
			a monumental undertaking. We
			could not hope to sustain such
			a project.
			Each community would be
			responsible for its own. These
			condensers could mean the
			difference between watering our
			crops... or watching them die.
			Well -- I'll be glad to pass
			along your suggestion. You'll
			see that this kind of
			participatory government works
			for everyone.
			Be well, Batai. I shall see you
			next month.
			Good to meet you, Kanin.
			Go carefully, Administrator...
			That went very well. I think he
			was impressed with you.
			We'll never see an atmospheric
			condenser...
			These things take time. It will
			happen, I'm sure of it.
			Come to dinner tonight, my friend.
			I'll make a vegetable stew. We'll
			talk about building our own
			condenser.
			Kamin --
			Hearing you talk to the
			Administrator... I realized that
			for the first time in years, you
			were speaking as though you were
			truly a member of the community.
			It was good to hear that again.
			You've been brooding behind that
			flute all evening.
			I'm not brooding. I'm immersed
			in my music.
			Music...
			I've found it helps me think.
			The real surprise is that I enjoy
			it so much.
			The real surprise is that you may
			actually be improving.
			Batai?
			Yes, ma'am.
			Go home.
			Yes, ma'am.
			Goodnight, Kamin.
			Goodnight, my friend.
			Go carefully, Batai.
			Don't forget these. I won't put
			them away for you again.
			Yes, ma'am.
			I've done nothing but nag today.
			I'm sorry.
			I'm the one who's sorry.
			Everything you said this morning
			was absolutely right.
			I've given you so little... and
			you have given me so much...
			tenderness, patience... and a good
			talking to when I needed it.
			You've been more than I could ever
			have hoped for. More than I
			deserve.
			You're a good man, a wonderful
			husband... I didn't mean to imply
			--
			Not such a wonderful husband.
			I spend my spare time charting
			the stars... I disappear for days
			at a time exploring the
			countryside... and I never put
			away my shoes. I lead my life
			very much as I did -- before.
			Old habits.
			You're gentle and kind... you've
			never raised your voice to me...
			I'd like to ask your permission
			to build something.
			Kamin, you've built your
			telescope, your laboratory -- you
			don't need my permission to build
			anything...
			In this case, I think I do.
			What is it?
			A nursery.
			Really? Really?
			Unless you'd rather have a porch.
			It'd certainly be easier to
			build...
			He's showing heightened activity
			in the cerebral cortex...
			Pulse and blood pressure are
			slightly elevated...
			Systemic activity?
			Increasing. And I'm getting
			heightened tactile responses.
			Set up a galvanic scan.
			Geordi, any progress identifying
			the probe?
			Maybe. I've picked up some
			residue on the probe's shell.
			I think it's from the propulsion
			system. Looks like it used a
			solid propellant as fuel.
			Solid propellant?
			Sensors read this stuff as
			crystalline emiristol. It
			produces a radioactive trail that
			ought to be traceable.
			Then we can send out a probe of
			our own. Trace it back to the
			point of origin.
			I'll get on it.
			Commander, I have been analyzing
			the nucleonic beam. I believe
			it would be possible to reflect
			the particles back toward the
			probe in a way that would
			disrupt the signal.
			Doctor... ?
			I don't know what it's doing to
			him, or what'll happen if we stop
			it...
			He could be dying by inches...
			His vital signs are stable.
			There's no indication he's in a
			life-threatening situation --
			I'm not willing to let that thing
			keep drilling into him --
			I simply don't know the risk of
			shutting down the beam. If
			someone gets stabbed, you don't
			necessarily pull the knife out
			right away -- that might do more
			harm than leaving it there.
			The captain is under attack. We
			must act.
			I'm inclined to agree. Doctor,
			monitor him closely. Mister Data,
			prepare to disrupt the beam.
			We're going to try to cut this
			cord.
			Meribor, this is your brother's
			ceremony; now don't fidget.
			We name this child for a dear
			friend who died last year... but
			who will now live on through his
			namesake.
			We name you -- Batai. In his
			honor.
			He's starting life in the warmth
			of friends. Thank you.
			Please, help yourselves to
			something to eat.
			It seems like just yesterday that
			we had Meribor's naming ceremony.
			I remember. I was so nervous I
			thought I might drop her.
			Now look at her... a little
			lady...
			She's no lady... tromping through
			the hills with you all day,
			digging those soil samples you
			insist on collecting... she's
			her father's daughter.
			What is it?
			I'd always thought I didn't need
			children to make my life
			complete... now, I can't imagine
			life without them.
			Kamin!
			Get the doctor -- hurry!
			I'm losing him!
			I'm getting massive somatophysical
			failure...
			Two cc's delactovine...
			Data, get that beam back.
			There are severe fluctuations in
			the isocortex... synaptic
			responses are failing...
			Begin full cardiac induction...
			Blood pressure is dropping
			rapidly... seventy over twenty
			--
			Data, you have to reestablish
			that beam.
			I am attempting to do so, Doctor.
			Losing response in the isocortex
			--
			Cortical stimulator...
			Start at ten percent...
			Doctor, the beam is fully
			restored.
			Blood pressure up to ninety over
			forty...
			... and rising...
			Isocortical functions are
			stabilizing... vital signs
			approaching normal levels...
			Meribor... ?
			Happy day, father...
			That's my hobby; find your own.
			You're the one who taught me.
			Don't complain if you turned me
			into a scientist.
			And what has the scientist been
			up to today?
			Analyzing soil samples.
			There's not even any anerobic
			bacteria. The soil is dead.
			This isn't just a long drought,
			is it?
			I have entries in my log that go
			back ten years. You have data
			that precedes that by fifteen
			years. You've reached the same
			conclusion, I know you have.
			I haven't reached any conclusion.
			A good scientist doesn't function
			by conjecture.
			A good scientist functions by
			hypothesizing and then proving
			or disproving that hypothesis.
			That's what I've done.
			Tell me... why don't you spend
			more time with that young fellow
			Dannick?
			You're changing the subject.
			I'm not; I'm hypothesizing that
			he's in love with you.
			You've taught me to pursue the
			truth -- no matter how painful
			it might be. It's too late to
			back off from that.
			I've analyzed the rings in old
			trees. I've examined rock strata
			to correlate evidence of climactic
			changes over the centuries.
			Father -- this planet is dying.
			Perhaps I should have filled your
			head with trivial concerns...
			games and toys and clothes...
			I don't think you mean that.
			No... but it saddens me to see
			you bear the burden of knowing
			things... things you can't change.
			It's no more a burden than you
			bear.
			But I'm not sixteen. With my life
			ahead of me.
			Father? I think I should marry
			Dannick sooner rather than
			later... don't you?
			I can only say...
			... Live now, Meribor. Always make
			"now" the most precious time.
			"Now" will not come again.
			I love you, father.
			Vital signs are holding... he's
			been stable ever since the beam
			was restored.
			I don't know what more to do for
			him.
			Commander, we're starting to
			receive telemetry from the probe
			we launched.
			Go ahead.
			We've charted the alien probe's
			radiation trail for just over
			one light year.
			Can you extrapolate a point of
			origin?
			Our best guess would be a star
			system in the Silarian sector...
			Kataan.
			Kataan... I've never heard of it.
			Data... ?
			It is an unmapped system of six
			planets.
			Any of them inhabited?
			Not any longer, sir. The star
			went nova. All life in the
			system was destroyed
			approximately one thousand years
			ago.
			I put your shoes away for you
			again.
			Ah. Thank you, dear.
			I've been looking through this
			thing off and on for almost thirty
			years... and I still can't see
			what you and Meribor find so
			fascinating.
			Fine. Then maybe you'll sit down
			and rest the way you're supposed
			to.
			You treat me like some frail
			flower. People have surgery all
			the time.
			He loves playing. And he's very
			good at it, you know.
			He loves doing a lot of things
			-- too many. One week he wants
			to be a botanist, the next week
			a sculptor. I wish he could find
			some focus in his life.
			I think he has.
			Maybe you should talk to him.
			Batai?
			Father... ?
			I get the feeling from your mother
			that you have something to tell
			me.
			Yes. I was waiting for the right
			moment... but that won't ever
			come.
			I'm leaving school.
			Leaving school -- ? No, you're
			not --
			I want to concentrate on my music.
			It's what I care about.
			Last year, all you cared about
			was mathematics. A year before
			that it was botany. Now --
			But through it all there was my
			music. I think you know that,
			father...
			This is the life I want.
			We'll... we'll discuss it.
			Thank you, father.
			Even after all these years... you
			have the ability to surprise me.
			If music is what he wants... why
			should I stand in his way?
			Who knows how much time he'll
			have to follow any dream.
			Are you still planning to talk
			to the Administrator tomorrow?
			Yes.
			It's possible he'll dismiss me
			from the Council.
			Unless, of course, you keep quiet.
			The evidence is too pronounced.
			I can't stay silent.
			What a surprise.
			Kamin, what do you hope to
			accomplish? Spreading rumors that
			the planet is doomed... there
			could be chaos.
			The facts are here. At least show
			them to someone who will recognize
			what they mean.
			I won't be a party to your making
			trouble --
			If you won't take them, I most
			certainly will.
			Your observations... your
			findings... our scientists reached
			those same conclusions two years
			ago.
			Well, what did you expect us to
			do? Make it public? Can you
			imagine the effect... ?
			Surely the technology exists to
			save something of this world...
			perhaps some people could be
			evacuated...
			Evacuated to where? Our
			technology is limited. We're just
			beginning to launch small
			missiles...
			A collection of genetic samples,
			then -- something, anything --
			you can't just let this
			civilization die --
			Enough!
			There is a plan in the works. I
			can't tell you more than that.
			Father!
			What is it -- ?
			It's mother. Hurry.
			Doctor -- ?
			You see... I'll go to any
			lengths... to get your attention.
			You always had a flair for the
			dramatic...
			Doctor... Batai... leave us alone
			for a moment. I want to talk to
			my husband.
			Did the Administrator look at your
			evidence?
			He didn't have to. They already
			know.
			So he didn't throw you off the
			Council...
			No...
			Remember -- put your shoes away.
			I will.
			Doctor...
			What is it?
			I'm not sure. He's showing
			physiological alterations... His
			systemic readings are changing...
			So are his respiratory functions.
			Is he in danger?
			I don't know... I don't understand
			what's happening. The changes
			are subtle, but...
			... If I didn't know better, I'd
			say these are the metabolic rates
			of an eighty-year-old man.
			Some children are certainly making
			a lot of noise in here.
			You shouldn't be out there for
			so long. It's damaging, you know
			that.
			I'm wearing plenty of your skin
			protector.
			Mmnph.
			Do you wear your skin protector
			outdoors, young man?
			Happy day, everybody! It's time
			to go see the launching.
			What "launching"? What's he
			talking about?
			They're sending up a missile,
			father. We're going to watch it.
			Are we, indeed. I'm not going
			anywhere to watch anything.
			Come on, Kamie; let's go see the
			launching.
			Breaks my heart to look at him...
			Who?
			My grandson. Breaks my heart...
			he deserves a full rich life, and
			he's not going to get one.
			He's my child, and I tell you he
			is getting one. I wish it could
			be longer, but it's as full and
			rich as we can possibly make
			it.
			Please come, father.
			Why didn't I hear anything about
			a launching?
			Did everyone know about this
			except me?
			I can see all right from here.
			You go on with the others. Go
			hold onto my grandson, and watch
			the damned thing go up... for all
			the good it'll do. What is it
			they're launching?
			You know about it, father.
			You've already seen it.
			Seen it? What are you talking
			about? I haven't seen any
			missile.
			Yes, you have, old friend...
			Don't you remember?
			Batai?
			You saw it... just before you came
			here.
			We hoped our probe would encounter
			someone in the future -- someone
			who could be a teacher... who
			could tell others about us.
			A probe... that encounters
			someone...
			... someone in the future...
			... it's me, isn't it? I'm the
			someone...
			I'm the one it finds... that's
			what this launching is -- a probe
			that finds me... in the future...
			Yes, my love...
			Eline...
			The rest of us have been gone for
			a thousand years...
			If you remember what we were, and
			how we lived... then we'll have
			found life again.
			Eline...
			Now we live. In you. Tell them
			of us... my darling...
			Something's happening...
			The nucleonic beam has ceased,
			Commander. The probe has shut
			down.
			His cerebral functions are
			stabilizing.
			Mister Worf, put a tractor beam
			on the probe. I want it in
			shuttlebay two for examination.
			Yes, Commander.
			What...
			Please, Captain... don't get up
			too quickly...
			How long? How long have I been...
			like this?
			At least twenty, maybe twenty-five
			minutes.
			Twenty-five minutes?
			Captain, I need you in sickbay
			now. I want to run a full
			diagnostic.
			Very well, Doctor. But as soon
			as you're done... I have a great
			deal to tell you.
			Come.
			Hello, sir. Feeling better?
			Yes, thank you... but I find I'm
			having to remind myself that this
			--
			-- is really my home.
			We were able to open the probe
			and examine it. Whatever it was
			that locked onto you must have
			been self-terminating. It isn't
			functional any longer.
			We found this inside.
