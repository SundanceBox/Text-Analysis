			Captain's log, stardate 45703.9.
			We are en route to Earth, where
			it will be my pleasant duty to
			deliver this year's commencement
			address at Starfleet Academy.
			I'm also looking forward to seeing
			Wesley Crusher again. His flight
			team will perform a demonstration
			near Saturn that will be
			transmitted to the graduation
			ceremonies.
			Captain, Starfleet Academy is
			requesting an update on our
			estimated arrival.
			Mister Data?
			We should arrive at Earth in ten
			hours, sixteen minutes, sir.
			Please inform the Academy and send
			my regards to Superintendant
			Brand.
			Aye, sir.
			Do you know Admiral Brand?
			We've met a few times. She's
			a... formidable woman.
			If she's anything like my
			superintendent...
			When I was at the Academy, we
			had a Vulcan superintendent who
			memorized the personnel file of
			every single cadet. He knew
			everything. It was like having
			your parents there with you. All
			the time.
			My superintendent was a Betazoid
			-- a full telepath. When he
			called you into his office, he
			didn't have to ask what you'd
			done.
			You got called into the
			superintendent's office? That
			sounds like a story I'd like to
			hear.
			Captain, we are being hailed by
			the Academy again. It is Admiral
			Brand.
			On-screen.
			Sir, she is requesting a private
			channel.
			In my ready room.
			Admiral Brand... what can I do
			for you?
			Hello, Captain.
			I know you're a close friend of
			the Crusher family.
			Yes... ?
			I wanted to inform you
			personally... There's been an
			accident.
			... he had second degree burns on
			his chest and a multiple fracture
			of his right arm. But he's going
			to be fine.
			Have they completed the
			regeneration series?
			I'm... not certain.
			Wesley's allergic to metorapan
			treatments... they'll have to use
			a bicaridine substitute.
			Beverly...
			I should send his complete records
			to the Academy infirmary... They
			probably have them already, but
			it never hurts to be sure. I'll
			also send them some information
			on a new rybotherapy I've been
			working on.
			Beverly...
			He's fine.
			I know he's fine... I know he's
			fine. Let's talk about something
			else.
			How did it happen?
			Apparently, Wesley's squadron was
			practicing on the Academy flight
			range near Saturn... they were
			in close formation when there
			was a collision... all five ships
			were destroyed.
			Four of the cadets managed to
			transport out... one did not.
			Do you know who it was?
			His name was Joshua Albert.
			Wesley talked about him... They
			were friends...
			Wesley was so excited about making
			the flight team... it made me a
			little nervous, but I was proud
			of him...
			... even though I knew there was
			always the chance that...
			something might...
			Beverly. Wesley is alive and
			well.
			Admiral Brand will be holding a
			full briefing after we arrive.
			I'll let you know as soon as we're
			in orbit.
			Thank you.
			There was very little left to
			salvage from the wreckage. We
			did recover one of the ships' data
			recorders, but it was badly
			damaged. We're attempting to
			restore the information, but it's
			going to take some time.
			Standard procedure calls for an
			immediate investigation by two
			command-level officers. Captain
			Satelk and I will begin taking
			depositions from Nova Squadron
			at fifteen-hundred hours today.
			Commander Albert... I'm sure that
			everyone in this room joins me
			in conveying my deepest sympathies
			to you on the tragic loss of your
			son.
			Was there any indication of a
			problem before the crash? What
			exactly were they doing out there?
			Did they file a flight plan?
			Commander... I'm sorry... right
			now, we don't have those answers.
			But I assure you we will
			investigate this matter
			thoroughly.
			There will be a memorial service
			for Cadet Albert this evening in
			the west garden.
			It has been suggested that we
			should cancel the graduation
			ceremonies in light of what's
			happened.
			Commander Albert and I have
			discussed this and we've agreed
			that commencement should go
			forward as planned. The cadets
			should know that even after a
			tragedy like this, there are still
			duties to perform... and that life
			continues. Thank you all for
			coming.
			It's good to see you again,
			Captain. I wish it were under
			better circumstances.
			It's an unhappy way to begin
			commencement. If you require any
			assistance, Admiral, the
			Enterprise is at your disposal.
			I'm sure we can handle the
			investigation... but thank you
			for the offer.
			Commander Albert?
			Yes?
			Hello, I'm Beverly Crusher. I
			just wanted to say... I'm sorry
			about your son.
			You're Wesley's mother...
			Yes.
			Josh once told me that Wesley was
			the only reason he made it through
			astrophysics.
			If there's anything I can do...
			Wes.
			Hi.
			How are you feeling, Wesley?
			Not too bad... the arm's still
			a little sore.
			We were so sorry to hear about
			Joshua.
			Would you like to talk about
			it... ?
			No. I don't think so. Thank you.
			I know you're trying to help,
			sir... but it seems like I
			haven't talked about anything
			else for the past two days. I
			don't want to go over it all
			again.
			I understand. But I want you to
			know I'm available if you should
			change your mind.
			All your friends on the Enterprise
			wanted you to know they're
			thinking about you... Commander
			Riker, Data, Robin Lefler...
			everybody.
			That's nice.
			Come in.
			Captain, sir.
			At ease, Cadet.
			This is my squadron leader,
			Nicholas Locarno... This is
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise... my mother, Doctor
			Beverly Crusher.
			Hello, Doctor... Captain Picard.
			Mister Locarno.
			I came by to see if Wes had healed
			up all right...
			How are you doing, Nicholas?
			I'm OK.
			I... just never lost anyone under
			my command before.
			I'm afraid it doesn't get any
			easier.
			Excuse me, Mom, Captain... but
			Nick and I have some things to
			talk about.
			Of course.
			If you need anything at all...
			I know.
			We'll see you at the inquiry.
			Good to meet you, Mister Locarno.
			You too, sir.
			The inquiry is scheduled for
			fifteen-hundred hours. Are you
			ready?
			I think so.
			Don't worry about it, Wes.
			Everything's going to be all right
			-- as long as we stick together.
			Boothby?
			Jean-Luc Picard... class of
			twenty-seven.
			I know that. What happened to
			your hair?
			How are you?
			I'm pretty damned cranky, thank
			you. I've already replanted this
			bed four times this week.
			Let me give you a hand...
			You?
			I've acquired an interest over
			the years.
			Well, careful you don't plant 'em
			too deep... the leaves...
			-- will rot...
			Something wrong, Cadet?
			Nossir, Captain.
			Captain Picard... of the
			Enterprise, no less... giving the
			commencement address...
			You sound... surprised...
			Surprised? Uh uh. Nothing you
			ever did surprised me, son.
			Nothing. Except that time you
			caught that Ligonian with a
			reverse body lift and pinned
			him in the first fourteen seconds
			of the match... didn't think you
			had it in you...
			Was all in the legs... from all
			the running I used to do...
			Boothby...
			Hmmm?
			I don't know that I've ever really
			told you... how much... I
			appreciate...
			... there's nothing to tell...
			Yes, there is... I just wanted
			to... while I was here...
			You know as well as I do I would
			never have made it to graduation
			if you hadn't...
			You made a mistake. There isn't
			a man among us who hasn't been
			young enough to make one...
			Nevertheless, you...
			You knew what you had to do...
			I just made sure you listened to
			yourself...
			At the time I thought you were
			a mean-spirited, vicious old man.
			I was. By the way, I was about
			the same age you are now.
			I didn't speak to you for months.
			You needed to find your bearings.
			I knew that. Important thing is
			what you did with your life
			afterwards... seems you did
			okay... that's all the thanks I
			need...
			Did you know the boy from Nova
			Squadron who was killed?
			Josh Albert? Yeah.
			Crusher. Hajar. Sito.
			Locarno. I know them all.
			Nervous?
			No.
			Yes.
			That's okay... so am I.
			But we're going to be all right.
			We have some tough times ahead...
			but we've always come through for
			each other.
			Whatever happens... I want you
			all to know... that leading this
			team has been the high point of
			my years at the Academy. No one
			could have asked for a better
			team... or better friends.
			Let's go.
			... at this point we accelerated
			and executed a starboard turn of
			twenty-seven degrees. We came out
			of the turn on course for Titan.
			And you were still in the lead
			position?
			Yes, sir.
			Continue.
			As we entered Titan's
			gravitational sphere, I gave the
			signal to tighten up and move into
			a diamond slot formation.
			Remaining in the diamond
			formation, we executed a low
			apogee turn around Titan... then
			began a z plus twenty-five degree
			climb in preparation for a Yeager
			loop.
			Approximately nine seconds later,
			Cadet Albert's ship collided with
			Cadet Hajar's.
			We had less than two seconds to
			activate our emergency
			transporters and beam to the evac
			station on Mimas. Everyone made
			it... except Josh.
			Thank you, Mister Locarno.
			Cadet Hajar...
			As Team Navigator, you filed a
			flight plan with the Academy Range
			Officer before the exercise,
			correct?
			Yes, sir.
			Did Nova Squadron deviate from
			that flight plan after you entered
			the Saturn range?
			No, sir.
			How do you explain the fact that
			the low apogee turn around Titan
			was at least two thousand
			kilometers closer to the moon than
			indicated in your plan?
			We were still within flight safety
			parameters, sir.
			That wasn't my question, Cadet.
			We had discussed changing the
			approach after I filed the flight
			plan. The final decision was made
			en route to Saturn. I didn't
			consider it significant enough
			to mention here.
			I apologize for the confusion,
			sir. I should have been more
			precise.
			Did you see Mister Albert's ship
			break formation before it collided
			with your ship?
			No, sir. My first indication of
			trouble was when my proximity
			alarm went off.
			Did any of you see the collision
			take place?
			No, sir...
			Ms. Sito, you were in the tail
			position; therefore, you should
			have been able to see any sign
			of trouble from Cadet Albert...
			and yet you saw nothing?
			That is correct, sir.
			Did your attention falter?
			No, sir. I was... flying on
			sensor readings at the time...
			I did not have visual contact with
			Cadet Albert's ship when he broke
			formation.
			What's wrong?
			It's unusual to fly on sensors
			alone in that type of maneuver.
			A pilot relies on the visual cues
			from the other ships to maintain
			formation.
			If you were flying on sensors
			alone, perhaps you could tell us
			the orientation of his ship just
			before the collision.
			I... don't know, sir.
			You were flying in a ship
			traveling eighty thousand k.p.h.,
			with Cadet Albert's ship less than
			ten meters away... and you don't
			know what his orientation was?
			I... don't remember, sir.
			Sir, if I may?
			Admiral...
			Josh was a good pilot... but
			lately he'd been having...
			difficulties. He would get
			nervous during close flybys and
			pull away in the final seconds...
			his formation flying was a little
			erratic.
			And you didn't report any of this?
			No sir, I didn't. We'd flown
			together a long time... I thought
			he could handle it if I gave
			him a chance. I was wrong.
			Then you're saying that the
			accident was Cadet Albert's fault?
			I think Josh got frightened and
			tried to pull out of the turn
			prematurely... and then crashed
			into Cadet Hajar.
			Josh was our friend... we didn't
			want him to be remembered as
			someone who panicked.
			Please be seated.
			I am... disturbed by what I've
			heard here today. By your own
			admission, you allowed your
			teammate to fly when you knew he
			was having difficulties
			maintaining formation. That
			demonstrates a serious lack of
			judgment.
			I am also disturbed by the fact
			that you did not come forward with
			this information immediately.
			We should have the first data
			from Mister Crusher's flight
			recorder tonight. We will
			reconvene at thirteen hundred
			hours tomorrow.
			Everything's fine. Trust me.
			Captain, the Academy has one of
			the best reconstructive analysis
			labs in Starfleet. I'm not sure
			we'll have much to contribute to
			the investigation.
			That may well be the case.
			However...
			Wesley is one of our own.
			Understood, sir. We'll get right
			on it.
			Good. I've spoken with Admiral
			Brand and she has agreed to allow
			us access to all of the physical
			evidence and testimony.
			Thank you, gentlemen.
			Computer, initiate a link between
			this station and the Starfleet
			Academy Database.
			You shouldn't have said it, Nick.
			Josh wasn't responsible for what
			happened.
			I had to do something...
			You said we wouldn't have to lie
			to them. We all agreed not to
			lie to them.
			I didn't lie. Everything I said
			was true.
			The accident was not Josh's fault.
			Look... he was my friend, too.
			I worked to get him on this team.
			But the truth is... he panicked.
			We don't know that...
			Of course we do... none of us has
			wanted to say it out loud... but
			we've all had the same thought.
			Haven't we?
			He must have pulled away too soon.
			I think he got scared.
			Sito?
			Wes... I know you want to protect
			his memory... we all do. But --
			we have to look out for
			ourselves now.
			What do you want us to do, walk in
			and tell them everything that
			happened?
			We might as well turn in our
			uniforms and start packing our
			bags.
			Are we ready for that?
			We'll take this one step at a
			time.
			This is the preliminary report
			on your flight recorder.
			It was so badly damaged in the
			crash, the lab was only able to
			retrieve a third of the total
			telemetry on the recorder... and
			all of it is from before the
			collision.
			There is no problem here.
			Nick... I don't think I can do
			this.
			You don't have to lie... just
			don't volunteer any new
			information.
			The first night I met you, Wes...
			I knew I wanted you on this squad.
			I knew what you'd bring to it...
			you, more than any of the others,
			would understand what it means
			to be able to count on someone.
			You've been out there, putting
			yourself on the line... you know
			you've got to be able to trust
			the people on your team...
			because your life is in their
			hands.
			And their lives are in yours.
			We made a promise, right in the
			beginning, that we'd stick
			together. We were Nova Squadron
			-- nobody else could say that.
			And even after we graduated we'd
			try to get posted to the same
			duty... we were going to be a
			team -- for a long time.
			Josh can't be a part of those
			plans anymore. But I think he'd
			still want us to be a team.
			What do you think?
			Mister Crusher?
			Sir.
			At ease.
			Am I interrupting?
			No, sir. I was just going over
			my deposition for tomorrow.
			They told me... I could find you
			here.
			I... found this in Josh's room...
			I... I think it belongs to you.
			The ski trip...
			We went to Calgary last month...
			Josh forgot his sweater... so he
			borrowed one of mine.
			He told me you... helped him with
			his classes.
			A little... he only needed help
			with statistical mechanics.
			If Josh had one weakness, it was
			mathematics...
			He could do it...
			He just didn't like to.
			His mother and I thought he'd
			never make it out of calculus.
			Then he found out what the Academy
			entrance requirements were like...
			that turned him around. He stayed
			after class, got a tutor... he
			worked really hard.
			He never gave up on anything...
			I... I know that... he had a lot
			of respect for you, and everyone
			on the team. I realize this was
			his fault... and that... you
			could've all been killed. I...
			I wanted to... to say...
			I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
			I'm sorry he let you down.
			Are you ready, Mister Crusher?
			Yes, sir.
			This is the beginning of our run
			toward Titan. I'm on the right
			wing.
			Where was Mister Albert at this
			point?
			He was on my port quarter, about
			fifty meters away.
			We just received the signal to
			begin the diamond slot formation.
			That's Cadet Locarno coming into
			view.
			We're in a twenty degree turn,
			coming around Titan...
			We should be coming out of Titan's
			gravity well about now...
			That is the extent of the data
			we were able to recover from the
			flight recorder. Mister Crusher,
			will you describe what happened
			after you left orbit of Titan?
			Once we'd cleared the moon...
			Mister Locarno led us into a
			Yeager loop... about nine seconds
			later, everything seemed to happen
			at once: the proximity alarm went
			off, I tried to veer away, but
			it was too late... I was hit...
			I lost control of the ship and
			a power coupling exploded in the
			cockpit... I don't know how, but
			I managed to activate my escape
			transporter... the next thing
			I remember was finding myself in
			the emergency evac station on
			Mimas with the rest of the
			squadron... except Josh.
			Do you have anything to add to
			your testimony?
			No, sir.
			Mister Crusher, will you describe
			a Yeager loop?
			The ships begin in a diamond slot
			formation. They climb and loop
			backwards at a steep angle... at
			the peak of the loop, all five
			ships flip over and accelerate
			in a new direction.
			Mister Crusher, did your team
			remain in formation throughout
			the loop?
			Yes, sir.
			I want you to be absolutely clear
			on this point, Mister Crusher.
			Before the collision, was Nova
			Squadron in a diamond slot
			formation?
			Yes, sir.
			Computer, display Saturn NavCon
			file six dash three seven nine.
			These images were obtained by a
			navigational control satellite
			in orbit around Saturn during a
			standard sensor sweep.
			Computer, freeze image.
			Magnify sector gamma three and
			enhance.
			This image was recorded when your
			ships moved briefly into the
			satellite's sensor range.
			According to the time index,
			what you see on the monitor took
			place seven seconds after Nova
			Squadron completed the Yeager loop.
			Mister Crusher, are these ships
			in a diamond slot formation?
			No, sir.
			What is your explanation, Mister
			Crusher?
			I have none.
			Everything's going to be okay,
			Wes. There's got to be an
			explanation for all this.
			Data and Geordi are already
			analyzing the flight recorder and
			the satellite transmission.
			Why?
			There must be something wrong
			with the satellite data... it
			might have been tampered with...
			Mom... that doesn't make any
			sense...
			Well there has to be some
			explanation... I know you're
			telling the truth... but that
			satellite data made it look like
			you were lying.
			I've spoken with the other
			parents...
			I'm going to go to Admiral Brand
			and ask that she delay the inquiry
			for at least--
			Mom. No.
			You can't do that.
			I'm not going to let them destroy
			your career, Wes... you haven't
			done anything wrong.
			Don't try to protect me, Mom...
			Please just... stay out of it.
			Look at this... weeds keep
			popping up in the primrose
			beds... poor flowers never have
			a chance to grow...
			You could use a good herbicide
			instead of crawling about on your
			hands and knees pulling weeds.
			And you could explore space on
			a holodeck instead of a
			starship.
			Boothby... tell me more about
			Nova Squadron.
			Not going well is it?
			No.
			Remember the parrises squares
			tournament in 'twenty four?
			That final game against Minsk...
			It took me three weeks to repair
			the grounds after the celebration.
			We had a lot to celebrate. Our
			team wasn't supposed to win.
			We were proud of them...
			Well... the cadets today are just
			as proud of Nova Squadron. The
			celebration they held after Nova
			won the Rigel Cup made 'twenty-four
			look like a dinner party.
			To the other cadets, the members
			of that team are gods... and
			that's a hard image to live up
			to. But Nick Locarno... he
			watches out for them... he keeps
			them together.
			Nick is what makes that team
			special... he's their coach,
			surrogate father, and best friend
			all in one... a natural leader.
			The members of that team love
			him... if he asks them to do
			something, they do it... even
			if it means going right over a
			cliff.
			He all but admitted to me that
			he was lying.
			What exactly did he say?
			He just asked me not to help
			him... but it was the way he said
			it ... the look on his face...
			Jean-Luc, I know my son, and he's
			in trouble.
			Report.
			Nothing conclusive.
			We do know the collision occurred
			about four seconds after the
			satellite images were recorded.
			But we still don't know how the
			ships got into the new formation
			or how the crash occurred.
			We have unsuccessfully tried over
			fifty different computational
			models in an effort to simulate
			the movements of Nova Squadron
			just prior to the crash.
			There're just too many variables
			to take into consideration...
			speed, attitude, course...
			Did Wesley's flight recorder
			indicate there was anything...
			unusual about the ship or the way
			it was operating?
			Well, the starboard power flow
			was fluctuating.
			However, it was well within
			operational limits.
			The fluidic pressure in the
			landing struts was low, but I
			don't know what difference that
			would make.
			We did find that Wesley had
			opened his coolant interlock just
			before beginning the maneuver
			around Titan.
			Which is a little unusual. The
			interlock is normally closed
			unless you're performing a check
			on the engine coolant levels.
			But there's no evidence Wesley
			was running that kind of check.
			Filling the primary coolant tanks
			requires an open interlock...
			but that can only be done in a
			maintenance bay. What other
			reasons are there to open that
			valve?
			It's the first step in purging
			the plasma exhaust.
			That procedure would be extremely
			hazardous while the ship was in
			flight.
			Yeah, the engine would probably
			ignite the plasma.
			Ignite the plasma... that's
			exactly what they were trying to
			do.
			Come.
			Captain.
			Can you tell me what maneuver this
			is?
			It's the Kolvoord Starburst.
			Five ships crossing within ten
			meters of each other and then
			igniting their plasma trails.
			One of the most difficult and
			spectacular demonstrations of
			precision flying. It hasn't been
			performed by an Academy team in
			over a century. Do you know why?
			It was banned by the Academy
			following a training accident.
			An accident in which all five
			cadets lost their lives.
			Nicholas Locarno wanted to end
			his Academy career in a blaze of
			glory... so he convinced the four
			of you to learn the Kolvoord
			Starburst for the commencement
			demonstration. If it worked,
			you'd thrill the assembled
			guests... and Locarno would
			graduate as a living legend.
			Except it didn't work... and
			Joshua Albert paid the price.
			Am I correct?
			I asked you a question, Cadet.
			I... choose not to answer, sir.
			You choose not to answer... and
			yet you've already given an answer
			to the inquiry... and that answer
			was a lie.
			I said the accident occurred after
			the loop, and it did.
			But you neglected to mention the
			fact that following the loop your
			team executed a dangerous maneuver
			which was the direct cause of the
			crash.
			Yes, you told the truth... but
			only to a point. And a lie of
			omission is still a lie.
			Do you remember the day you first
			came aboard this ship? Your
			mother brought you to the
			bridge...
			Yes.
			You even sat in my chair. It
			annoyed me at first... a
			presumptuous child playing on my
			ship. But I never forgot the way
			you knew every control and
			display before you ever set foot
			on the bridge. You acted like
			you belonged there.
			I remember.
			Later... when I decided to make
			you an acting ensign, I was
			convinced you would be an
			outstanding officer. I've never
			questioned that conviction...
			until now.
			The first duty of every Starfleet
			officer is to the truth... be it
			scientific truth, historical
			truth, or personal truth. It is
			the guiding principle upon which
			Starfleet is based. If you cannot
			find it within yourself to stand
			up and tell the truth about what
			happened... you do not deserve
			to wear that uniform.
			Mister Crusher... I'll make this
			simple for you. Either you come
			forward and tell Admiral Brand
			what really took place... or I
			will.
			Captain...
			Dismissed.
			Your message said it was urgent...
			They know, Nick. They know what
			we did.
			Calm down... now tell me exactly
			what happened.
			Captain Picard called me to the
			Enterprise... when I got there
			he said he'd figured it out...
			the Kolvoord manuever, the
			cover-up, everything. He said
			that if I didn't come forward now
			and tell the truth... he would.
			You said he'd "figured it out"...
			did he have any evidence?
			No... but he still knew exactly
			what happened.
			Captain Picard doesn't know
			anything... he has a theory. Let
			him tell the inquiry what he
			thinks happened... they'll ask
			us, "Is it true?" and we'll say,
			"No, sir". There's no evidence,
			so there's no case... and we'll
			get off with a reprimand.
			You're asking me to call Captain
			Picard a liar.
			Wesley... we just have to hold
			on a little longer... then this
			will all be over.
			It's wrong...
			Wesley...
			No. I'm going to tell them what
			happened.
			You're going to tell them what
			happened. You. Alone. Are going
			to decide what happens to me...
			to Sito... to Jean. You're going
			to decide that.
			I'm not going to lie to them
			again, Nick... I can't live with
			it.
			You can't lie to them... you can't
			live with it... you have to tell
			them what happened. Who the hell
			are you?
			Nick...
			You're going to turn us in?
			Hey, wait a minute...
			No, you wait a minute...
			He got to you, didn't he? Picard
			gave you a big speech about duty
			and honor...
			It must've been a pretty good
			speech to make you want to turn
			your back on your friends.
			We're Starfleet cadets, we have
			a duty to the truth.
			What about your duty to your
			friends?
			I got you on this team... I gave
			you a chance when there were
			upperclassmen waiting in line.
			I said, "He won't let us down.
			He was on the Enterprise. He
			knows what it's like to trust
			somebody with his life." I guess
			I was wrong...
			Nick, if we all come forward
			together... tell Admiral Brand---
			We don't want to come forward...
			Sito and Jean and me... we don't
			have a problem with this.
			But if you do... then resign your
			appointment to the Academy and
			walk away. Don't make us pay for
			your guilty conscience.
			You'd let me do it, wouldn't you?
			You'd let me throw my career away
			just to save your neck.
			To save the team. That's more
			important than you and it's more
			important than me.
			And if I was in your place... I'd
			do it. Without hesitation.
			But that's me.
			Captain Satelk and I have gone
			over your testimony and the
			physical evidence from the crash.
			Your statements cannot be
			reconciled with the data collected
			from the NavCon satellite.
			Your unwillingness to offer any
			explanation for this contradiction
			is disappointing, and it raises
			suspicion. We cannot escape the
			conclusion that either the data
			is faulty in some way... or you
			have lied to us.
			However... suspicion is not
			proof... and I have no proof that
			you have lied to this inquiry.
			Therefore... unless further
			evidence is presented, I have no
			choice but to close this
			investigation.
			For filing an inaccurate flight
			plan, and for allowing Cadet
			Albert to fly despite the fact
			that you knew he had been having
			difficulties, I am ordering a
			formal reprimand placed on each
			of your permanent records. I am
			also revoking your flight
			privileges.
			This inquiry is closed.
			Sir... I would like to add
			something to my testimony.
			Proceed, Mister Crusher.
			Yesterday, I testified that the
			crash occurred following a Yeager
			loop. That's not entirely true.
			We did perform the loop. But
			after that, we broke formation...
			and attempted a Kolvoord
			Starburst.
			We knew it was prohibited and that
			it would be dangerous, but we
			wanted to do something spectacular
			for the commencement
			demonstration... So we pushed
			Josh... and he wasn't ready.
			We thought we could do it... we
			thought we could do anything.
			We were wrong... and Josh died.
			Josh didn't let us down, sir.
			It wasn't his fault.
			Cadet Sito, is this true?
			Yes, sir.
			Cadet Hajar?
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Locarno, you're the leader
			of Nova Squadron... do you have
			anything to say?
			Mister Locarno?
			No, sir.
			Mister Locarno has been expelled.
			They should've expelled all of
			us.
			They almost did. But... Mister
			Locarno made an impassioned plea
			for the rest of you. He said he
			used his influence as squadron
			leader to convince you all to
			try the Kolvoord maneuver and
			then to cover up the truth.
			He asked to take full
			responsibility.
			He did exactly what he said he
			would -- he protected the team.
			I feel awful... I've let everybody
			down... my friends, Mom, you.
			You should feel bad... and you
			will pay for what you did.
			Admiral Brand has decided that,
			in addition to a formal reprimand,
			your academic credits for the past
			year will be cancelled and you will
			not advance with your class.
			I understand.
			It won't be easy... staying here
			on campus with everyone knowing
			what you did... I think you have
			some rough times ahead.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain... thank you.
			You knew what you had to do...
			I just made sure you listened
			to yourself.
			Good-bye, Cadet.
			Good-bye, Captain.
