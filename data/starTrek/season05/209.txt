			Captain's log, stardate 45333.3.
			The Enterprise is on its way to
			Penthara Four where a type C
			asteroid has struck an unpopulated
			continent.
			The resulting dust cloud could
			very well create a phenomenon not
			unlike the nuclear winters of
			twenty-first-century Earth.
			Commander La Forge has begun work
			on a plan that would counteract
			the devastation.
			I'm afraid the numbers coming in
			are already indicating climatic
			changes, sir.
			What kind of drop can we expect?
			If the Pentharan spheral forecasts
			are correct, ten to twelve degrees
			Celsius within the first ten days.
			If it continues like that, their
			entire ecosystem will be shot
			to hell.
			And I doubt they're prepared to
			cope with the kind of cold that's
			coming.
			Commander Riker.
			Yes, Captain.
			Would you join me on the bridge,
			please.
			On my way.
			Let me know if those forecast
			numbers change.
			Are you certain, Worf?
			There was a space/time
			distortion, sir. And there is
			something back there. We passed
			within three hundred kilometers
			of it.
			A bit close for coincidence.
			Mister La Forge?
			Yes, sir.
			Would a delay of an hour affect
			your plans?
			Not unless another asteroid
			decides to pay a call on Penthara,
			sir.
			The odds of that occurring,
			Captain, are extremely unlikely,
			given the time frame.
			Thank you, Mister Data.
			Prepare to come about, Ensign.
			Let's take a look at Mister Worf's
			distortion.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf's what?
			The Lieutenant's sensors detected
			a temporal distortion, Number One,
			almost directly on our current
			course. There seems to be a small
			object back there that wasn't
			there a few moments ago.
			The object is fifty kilometers
			ahead, sir.
			Full stop, Ensign.
			Aye, sir.
			On screen.
			Dimensions, Worf?
			Approximately five meters in
			length, sir.
			Lifesigns?
			No signs of any kind, sir.
			Sensors are not penetrating its
			hull.
			Try hailing it.
			That's odd.
			What's odd?
			We've received a response, sir,
			but...
			Yes, Mister Worf?
			They want you to... "Move over,"
			sir.
			Reply that the Enterprise isn't
			going anywhere, Lieutenant.
			Not the Enterprise, Captain. You.
			What are you trying to...
			Excuse me, Captain, but you were
			standing right where I needed to
			be.
			Who are you?
			Rasmussen's the name, sir.
			Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.
			Ah... this is wonderful.
			Actually, quite a bit larger than
			I thought.
			Really?
			Where I come from, every historian
			knows the bridge of old 1701-D.
			And where exactly is it you come
			from?
			Why Earth... late twenty-sixth
			century Earth, to be exact. You
			see, I've traveled back nearly
			three hundred years just to find
			you.
			Exactly what kind of historian
			are you?
			My focus is on the twenty-second 
			through the twenty-fourth centuries,
			early interstellar history.
			You know, it was always believed
			this was on your desk, not here...
			Fascinating.
			Now don't move it on my account.
			You can't expect me to believe
			that the layout of my ready room
			is of interest to future
			historians...
			No less so than your legendary
			modesty, Captain. I wish I could
			describe to you what a thrill it
			is to be here...
			This is the original, isn't it?
			You flatter me Professor, but I
			can't help but wonder what could
			possibly have caused you to select
			me as the subject of your study.
			Even in this decade, there are
			far wiser and more experienced
			Humans both in and out of
			Starfleet.
			I'd love to tell you, Picard.
			I really would. But try and
			imagine what a young Caesar might
			have done differently if someone
			had given him a hint of what lay
			ahead. Or, if Lincoln had been
			coerced into changing his theater
			plans. I truly wish I could be
			more specific on why you were
			selected, but I'm afraid the
			exchange of information will have
			to flow in one direction only.
			...four... five... six... seven
			meters. HA! I was right!
			Why now?
			Right. If you came back to study
			us, to study the captain, why did
			you pick today? Why not a year
			ago... or a year from now?
			Oh, I picked the right day
			alright. Just wait, you'll see.
			Do you always sit there, on that
			side of the table?
			Usually. Why?
			It's not important.
			Tell me, Professor, at what point
			does time travel become a tool
			for historians?
			Now, now, Commander. You know
			better than that. I've studied
			a great deal about your century.
			Including the fact that you're
			all quite aware of the dangers
			of anyone altering the past. And
			that's exactly what I'd be doing
			if I were to divulge information
			like that.
			Telurian plague!
			I beg your pardon?
			Telurian plague... was it cured?
			I mean, has it been cured by your
			century? There can't be any harm
			in asking that.
			I realize it will be difficult,
			but we must all keep our questions
			regarding the future to ourselves.
			Professor...
			I'll be preparing questionnaires
			for each of you. Please complete
			them at your convenience. If
			you're concerned about a possible
			breach of security, I'm sure your
			captain can make a
			determination... And, thank you
			in advance for curbing your
			curiosity.
			If I hand my assignment in on
			time, do I get a little glimpse
			into next week's poker game?
			Mister Data, please show the
			Professor to his quarters.
			This way, sir.
			What did he mean he picked the
			right day?
			You know everything I do, Will.
			Deanna?
			It's hard to tell. But he is
			holding something back.
			Of course he is. Think of all
			the things he could tell us...
			all the things he'd like to tell
			us...
			That might be it, I don't know.
			How can we be sure he's not an
			imposter? God knows we've run
			into enough of them.
			He is Human. Our medical scans
			have proved that. Haven't they,
			Doctor?
			He's Human, alright.
			And there was a temporal
			distortion back there, correct
			Mister Worf?
			Yes, sir.
			And no one can deny that ship of
			his is unlike anything we've ever
			seen before.
			The hull is composed of some kind
			of plasticized tritanium mesh.
			Nothing we have on record... at
			least not 'til the present.
			I appreciate your caution, Mister
			Worf. I share it. Have his
			vessel brought into a shuttlebay.
			Place it under guard.
			Yes, sir.
			I realize this isn't going to
			be an easy visit for some of you.
			Nevertheless, I've reviewed the
			Professor's credentials, and
			they're in order. So, I'd like
			you all to extend him every
			courtesy.
			Including questionnaires?
			Including questionnaires.
			Dismissed.
			This is really a thrill, Data.
			Like running across a Redstone
			missile or a Guttenberg bible.
			To think... the Model T of
			androids.
			If you're referring to the first
			production model automobile of
			the twentieth century, perhaps the
			subsequent Model A might be a more
			apt analogy since I am Noonian
			Soong's revised prototype.
			I stand corrected.
			Is there a problem, sir?
			I suppose it will have to do, for
			now. I'll get you a list of
			things I'll be needing. You're
			dismissed.
			Would I be correct, Professor,
			in assuming that you know whether
			or not I am still... alive in
			the twenty-sixth century?
			Since you seemed to know so much
			about Captain Picard and the
			ship... I assumed that you
			would...
			It would be best if you kept your
			assumptions to yourself, wouldn't
			it?
			Yes, sir. I am sorry, sir.
			Captain's log, stardate 45334.5.
			We have arrived at Penthara
			Four...
			... and can see for ourselves the
			atmospheric devastation caused
			by the asteroid impact.
			We've located three underground
			pockets of carbon dioxide...
			here, here and here. Our drilling
			phasers can release enough of the
			gas to form an envelope which
			would temporarily hold in the heat
			from the sun.
			We spend years, decades trying
			to avoid anything that would lead
			to a greenhouse effect and here
			we are about to create one on
			purpose.
			Less than twenty percent of your
			normal sunlight is getting through
			that dust, Doctor. If we can hold
			enough heat in with the CO2, it
			should give the planet time to
			mend itself.
			Doctor Moseley.
			What now?
			New Seattle is reporting a cloud
			depth of twelve kilometers. Two
			rivers, tropical rivers, are
			beginning to freeze.
			We better get started before
			there's nothing left to mend.
			Look who's here.
			I hate questionnaires.
			Professor, please come join us.
			I hope I'm not intruding.
			Not at all. You're probably the
			topic of conversation at every
			table in the room.
			As I promised, here are your
			assignments. I'm sure they'll
			be painless. Please try to
			complete them by tomorrow.
			Tomorrow!
			No problem, Professor.
			You're all very calm.
			Do we have reason not to be?
			History always records where
			people were, what they were doing,
			when important events took place.
			But it rarely remembers their
			activities -- say, a week before...
			or a day... or even an hour.
			Are you suggesting an important
			event is imminent?
			I didn't say that, did I?
			Please... go on doing what you
			were doing, pretend I'm not here.
			How come there's no record of
			other future historians traveling
			back to witness "important
			events?"
			We're obviously very careful.
			Matter of fact, a colleague and
			I recently paid a call on a
			twenty-second century vessel.
			They hadn't even perfected
			quarantine fields by then. You
			must have seen surgical masks and
			gloves.
			Isn't it fascinating how everyone
			has different interests when it
			comes to history... different
			perspectives on progress.
			Mind if I ask what that is?
			Just checking the time... No
			problem.
			Is something supposed to be
			happening here?
			No, no, nothing.
			What about you, Commander? What
			do you see as the most important
			example of progress over the
			last two hundred years?
			I suppose the warp coil. Before
			we had warp drive, Humans were
			confined to a single sector of
			the galaxy.
			Spoken like the consummate
			explorer.
			What's going on? You waiting for
			someone?
			Phasers!
			Where?!
			Beg your pardon?
			There were no phasers in the 22nd
			century.
			Ah, you see Doctor? Our Klingon
			friend is a perfect example of
			what I was trying to tell you.
			He views history through the eyes
			of a hunter, a warrior. His
			passion lies in the perfection
			of the tools of violence. How
			delightfully primitive.
			As soon as we input this
			atmospheric data from Moseley,
			the computer should tell us
			how many holes we'll have to
			punch.
			Ah, Data. Good.
			What have you learned about the
			tectonic stability around the
			drilling sites?
			Couldn't be better. Our scans
			were all clear and Moseley says
			there hasn't been so much as a
			quiver in over a century.
			Ah, just the two I'm looking for.
			I've brought the forms I'd like
			you to complete.
			It shouldn't take more than a
			couple of hours.
			We're kind of busy here,
			Professor. Tomorrow might be
			better.
			We've got about twenty-three
			thousand thermal simulations.
			You think you could check them
			through for anomalies?
			Certainly.
			Is that as fast as he can go?
			Not fast enough for you,
			Professor?
			There's very little known about
			Data's efficiency... almost
			nothing about his part in this
			mission. It's a topic of great
			conjecture.
			Two hundred nine anomalies all
			within acceptable parameters.
			Thanks, Data.
			You've come to witness this
			mission... that's it, isn't it?
			It would be best if you just
			thought of me as a fly on the
			wall, and went about your
			business.
			I will return the answered
			questions to you as soon as
			possible, sir.
			Data... at Penthara Four!
			If you'll excuse me.
			Your prosthesis...
			What do you call it?
			A VISOR.
			VISOR, right. I have a picture
			of you in my office wearing that.
			How do you like it?
			It allows me to see... I like it
			fine.
			You know, Homer was blind... and
			Milton. Bach, Monet, Wonder...
			A fly on the wall, eh?
			A fly on the wall.
			The computer has configured the
			drilling pattern and specified
			depths.
			Captain, we've got what we need.
			I'm ready to transport to the
			surface.
			We'll notify Doctor Moseley. Good
			luck, Geordi.
			Gentlemen.
			Who said these moments were any
			less exciting when you know the
			outcome?
			I know of no one who said that,
			Professor.
			The Enterprise will monitor the
			CO2 concentrations at six
			different altitudes. If all goes
			well, it won't take more than
			twenty bore sites.
			Let's hope all goes well.
			La Forge to Commander Riker. How
			are you doing?
			We're ready when you are, Geordi.
			All we need's an open channel
			with Data.
			Open the channel, Mister Worf,
			and prepare to fire at target one.
			The computer has locked in phaser
			depth calculations.
			Mister Data?
			Ready, sir.
			Fire.
			Target one is emitting two
			thousand cubic meters per second.
			Target two, one thousand six
			hundred.
			Surface wind patterns over targets
			are stable.
			You picking up anything at
			altitude, Data?
			CO2 concentrations remain
			unchanged at upper elevations.
			Have I missed much?
			Target fourteen complete, sir.
			Data?
			No change, Commander.
			Winds, Geordi?
			Holding steady, sir.
			The computer has stopped the
			drilling.
			You should be getting something,
			Data.
			Elevated CO2 levels at twenty
			kilometers.
			Now you're talking. And we've
			got some new temperatures coming in.
			All thermal monitoring stations
			are reporting no further
			temperature drops.
			Correction, Doctor. Two
			equatorial stations are showing
			slight increases.
			Thank you.
			Thank you all. You've given us
			what we need... time.
			Glad we could help, Doctor. The
			Enterprise will remain in orbit
			and continue to monitor your
			progress. Picard out.
			"You've given us what we need...
			Time."
			Mister Worf, return to a
			synchronous orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			Very clever, Picard. And, well
			done. We've always known how you
			did it, but to experience the
			moment, to witness the nuances...
			it's indescribable.
			He's after more than a history
			lesson. I can tell you that.
			What is it? What are you getting
			from him?
			I don't know. But it's like he's
			trying to confuse us... misdirect
			us somehow.
			Well that certainly was exciting,
			wasn't it?
			Professor. Is everything alright?
			Are you well?
			Couldn't be better, thank you.
			I just thought we might chat about
			your questionnaire.
			Buck up, crewman, you're a credit
			to that uniform.
			I've got some things to take care
			of.
			No, please Counselor. I would
			very much appreciate your
			remaining.
			Doctor, in response to my sixth
			question, you spoke of a neural
			stimulator. May I see one?
			I don't see why not.
			Give me a minute.
			You don't like me very much, do
			you?
			I don't dislike you, Professor.
			Keep your eyes wide, soldier.
			You'll be telling your
			grandchildren how you were there
			at Penthara Four.
			But you don't trust me. You
			should, you know.
			Should I?
			"Picard's empath won't trust you."
			That's what they all said.
			Picard's empath?
			We're not that unalike, you and
			I. You possess a sense that is
			foreign to the others. My
			knowledge of the future is
			similar. You know, some of my
			best friends are empaths... they
			trust me.
			Why would you care whether I trust
			you or not?
			We're birds of a feather...
			colleagues. We could learn a lot
			from each other.
			You're right... I don't trust you.
			I knew you'd say that.
			I'm sure you did.
			Well, it's nice to see you two
			are finally getting along.
			I really must be going.
			Why don't you try a Berylite scan?
			I'd be interested to see where
			his micro-levels are.
			So... what else can I show you?
			You're a very curious woman.
			No, no. I don't mean curious like
			that. I mean you're curious...
			curious about things. About
			Berylite levels... about the
			future.
			Curiosity is why most of us are
			out here, professor.
			I understand. But you're
			different. More... vibrant.
			More...
			More vibrant. That's nice, I like
			that.
			You know, whenever I... travel
			back, I meet very interesting
			people... men and women. But
			never anyone who gave me thoughts
			about not going home.
			You're not supposed to be
			influencing the past, remember?
			And I'm beginning to feel a
			little... influenced. Anyway,
			I'm old enough to be your great,
			great, great, great, grandmother!
			What kind of questions did he have
			for you, Number One?
			All he wanted to know about was
			previous starships. What I
			thought was innovative on the
			last Enterprise or the one before
			that. He said he wanted to see
			how well we "grasped the
			fundamentals."
			His queries to me primarily
			focused on Doctor Soong's...
			Captain, I am detecting a massive
			earthquake on the surface.
			Two earthquakes, sir.
			Location?
			Both epicenters are beneath the
			two southernmost drill sites,
			Captain.
			Is La Forge still down there?
			Yes, sir.
			Find him.
			We've also got some volcanic
			activity... pretty severe.
			Magnify.
			La Forge here, Captain. Moseley
			and I are on our way back to his
			lab.
			Are you alright?
			We're okay, but those were pretty
			big, sir. If this was Earth, I'd
			say around an eight or an eight
			five on the Richter Scale. We're
			starting to see some volcanic
			plumes, Captain.
			Two more eruptions, sir.
			It is most likely that we
			overestimated the geologic
			stability around the CO2 pockets.
			We're in the lab, sir.
			We're fairly well quake-proofed
			down here, Picard. It's the
			volcanic dust I'm worried about.
			What about the dust?
			The ash the volcanos are throwing
			into the atmosphere is going to
			compound the existing problem.
			In a matter of days, there'll be
			no sunlight getting through those
			clouds.
			And no amount of CO2 is going to
			help us then.
			Captain, look at this.
			These are the coordinates of the
			eruptions, and these...
			... are the phaser drilling sites.
			The mantle is collapsing where
			the pressure was released.
			Captain, Doctor Moseley and I have
			a couple of ideas, but they're
			going to take some time to sort
			out.
			Sort them out, Commander.
			Aye, sir.
			We came here to help these people.
			And look what we've done.
			What in God's name is that?!
			Music, Professor.
			Music?
			Yes, sir. Mozart's "Jupiter
			symphony in G minor"; Bach's "Third
			Brandenberg Concerto"; Beethoven's
			"Symphony Number Nine, Second
			Movement 'Molto Vivace'"; and "La
			Donna e Mobile", from Verdi's
			"Rigoletto".
			Could you thin it out a bit?
			Computer, eliminate Program One.
			Computer, eliminate Program Two.
			Computer, eliminate Program Three.
			Computer, half volume.
			How the hell can you listen to
			four pieces of music at the same
			time?
			Actually, I am capable of
			distinguishing over one hundred
			fifty simultaneous compositions.
			But in order to analyze the
			aesthetics, I try to limit myself
			to ten or less.
			Only four today?
			I am assisting Commander La Forge
			in the analysis of an extremely
			complex calculation. It demands
			a great deal of my concentration.
			I came to thank you for answering
			my questions, though I probably
			should have asked you to limit
			yourself to fifty thousand words.
			You did ask me to be thorough.
			I realize it's hard to believe,
			Data, but very few records of
			Doctor Soong's work survived to
			the twenty-sixth century. It
			would be invaluable to myself and
			other historians if you could
			provide us with some schematics.
			Certainly, as soon as my work here
			is completed.
			Just as long as it's before
			oh-nine-hundred tomorrow. That's
			when I'll be... heading back.
			Bridge to Commander Data.
			Yes, Worf.
			Commander La Forge is hailing you
			from the surface, sir.
			Patch it through, please.
			Have you rerun the phase reversal
			figures, Data?
			There were no errors, Geordi.
			The variance must be no more than
			point zero six terawatts.
			I don't see any other choice.
			We'll keep running the numbers
			down here. You better inform the
			captain... of the good news and
			the bad news. La Forge out.
			Which do you suppose he's going
			to want to hear first?
			The good news.
			The motion of the dust has created
			a great deal of electrostatic
			energy in the upper atmosphere.
			With a modified phaser blast, we
			could create a shock-front that
			would encircle the planet and
			ionize the particles.
			That would be like striking a
			spark in a room filled with gas.
			With one exception, sir. The
			particles would be converted
			into a high-energy plasma which
			our shields could absorb and
			redirect harmlessly into space.
			Turn the Enterprise into a
			lightning rod.
			Precisely, sir.
			And what about the bad news, Data?
			If our phaser discharge is off
			by as little as point-zero-six
			terawatts, it would cause a
			cascading exothermal inversion.
			Meaning?
			We would completely burn off the
			planet's atmosphere.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			While Doctor Moseley takes La
			Forge's plan to the leaders of
			the colony, I find myself weighing
			the potential consequences of a
			more philosophical issue.
			Come.
			I would imagine you know why I've
			asked you here.
			I have a fairly good idea.
			I'm faced with a dilemma. There's
			a planet beneath us that is slowly
			turning to ice. If we don't do
			something about it, I'm told that
			within weeks, thousands, perhaps
			tens of thousands, will die.
			That would be a shame.
			Yes, it would. It would be quite
			a shame.
			So what's your dilemma?
			Mister La Forge has a possible
			solution. The margin of error
			is extremely critical, but if it's
			successful, there's no more
			threat.
			And if it's not successful?
			Every living thing on the planet
			will perish.
			So... do nothing and thousands
			will die. Do something and
			millions could die. Tough choice.
			Not if you were to help me.
			You're not suggesting I tell you
			the outcome of your efforts?
			No, I'm not. Everything Starfleet
			stands for, everything I've ever
			believed in, tells me I can't
			ask you that.
			But at the same time, there are
			twenty million lives down there,
			and you know what happened to
			them... what will happen to them.
			So, it seems you have another
			dilemma. One that questions your
			convictions.
			I have never been afraid to
			reevaluate my convictions,
			Professor. Right now, I have
			twenty million reasons to do so.
			And why did you ask to see me?
			Your presence potentially gives
			me access to a kind of information
			that was never available to me
			before. An additional tool, a
			new weapon in my armory... you,
			Professor. If I'm going to
			reexamine my beliefs, I must
			take advantage of every possible
			asset. It would be irresponsible
			of me not to have you here.
			However you come to terms with
			your beliefs, Captain, I must
			tell you I'm quite comfortable 
			with mine.
			How can you be? How can you be
			"comfortable" watching people die?
			Let me put it this way. If I were
			to tell you that none of those
			people died, you'd easily conclude
			that you tried your "solution"
			and it succeeded. So, you'd
			confidently try again. No harm
			in that. But what if I were to
			tell you they all died? What
			then? Obviously, you'd decide not
			to make the same mistake twice.
			Now, what if one of those...
			I know, Professor, "What if one
			of those lives I save down there
			is a child who grows up to be the
			next Adolf Hitler or Khan Singh?"
			First year philosophy students
			have been asked that question ever
			since the earliest wormholes were
			discovered. But this is not a
			class in temporal logic... It's
			not hypothetical, it's real.
			Can't you see that?
			I see it all too well. But you
			must see that if I were to
			influence you, everything in this
			sector, in this quadrant of the
			galaxy could change. History, my
			history, would unfold in a way
			other than it already has. Now
			what possible incentive could
			anyone offer me to allow that to
			happen?
			I have two choices. Either way,
			one version or another of history
			will wend its way forward. The
			history you know or another one.
			Who's to say which is better?
			All I know here, today, is that
			one way, millions of lives could
			be saved. Isn't that incentive
			enough?
			Everyone dies, Captain. It's just
			a question of when. All of those
			people down there died years
			before I was born. All of you
			up here, as well. So you see,
			I can't get quite as worked up
			as you over the fate of some
			colonists who, for me, have been
			dead a long time.
			We have a Prime Directive,
			Professor, which tells us we have
			no right to interfere with the
			natural evolution of alien worlds.
			But even though I am sworn to
			uphold it, I have disregarded that
			directive on more than one
			occasion... When I knew it was
			the right thing to do. If you
			are holding true to some
			"temporal" equivalent of that
			directive, isn't there a
			possibility that this is an
			occasion for you to make an
			exception, to help me choose...
			because it's the right thing to
			do?
			Are we just talking about a
			choice? It sounds to me like
			you're trying to manipulate the
			future.
			Every choice we make allows us
			to manipulate the future. Do I
			ask Marie or Suzanne to the spring
			dance? Do I take my holiday on
			Tahiti or on Risa? A man's life,
			his future, hinges on each of a
			thousand choices. Living is
			making choices.
			Now you ask me to believe that
			if I make a choice other than the
			one found in your history books,
			it could irreparably alter your
			past! Well, perhaps I don't give
			a damn about your past, Professor
			Rasmussen. Because your past is
			my future and as far as I'm
			concerned, it hasn't been written
			yet.
			Captain, the electrostatic
			conditions are about as good as
			they're going to get. If we're
			going to try this, now's the time.
			Please don't ask me, Captain.
			I can't help you. I'm sorry.
			How long will it take them to
			program the phasers, Number One?
			We just need to tie in Geordi's
			atmospheric sensors.
			So you've made your choice after
			all... and without my help.
			Quite the contrary, Professor.
			You've been quite helpful.
			How's that?
			By your refusing to assist me,
			I'm left with the same choice I
			began with; to try or not to
			try... to run the risk or to play
			it safe. But your arguments have
			reminded me how precious the right
			to choose can be... that right
			or wrong, the choice is mine.
			And since I've never been much
			for playing it safe... I choose
			to try.
			Program the firing sequence,
			Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain's log, stardate 45335.0.
			Doctor Moseley has met with the
			colony leaders, who all agree
			they are willing to take the
			risk.
			Warp power is being rerouted to
			the main deflector dish,
			Commander.
			Keep the phasers on active surge
			control, Worf. We're only going
			to have one shot at this.
			Well, this is it!
			You have the sequence locked in,
			Data?
			Yes, sir. After an eight point
			three second burst from the dish,
			we will discharge all EPS taps
			through the phasers.
			Geordi, it's time you return to
			the ship.
			Mister O'Brien, prepare to
			transport...
			Excuse me, sir, but I can be a
			lot more help down here. We've
			got to compensate for the density
			variations right up to the last
			second.
			Doctor Moseley's computers can
			accomplish the same task, sir.
			But Commander La Forge would be
			better able to anticipate
			unexpected variances.
			Geordi, you know better than
			anyone that there's no guarantee
			this is going to work. And if
			it fails...
			There's no guarantee it's going
			to fail, Captain. I'd like your
			permission to remain on the
			surface.
			Permission granted.
			La Forge remained below.
			Good luck, Commander.
			Thank you, sir.
			The deflector dish has been
			reconfigured, Captain.
			Proceed, Mister Data.
			Stand by for auto-phaser interlock.
			Activating deflector beam.
			EPS taps are on-line.
			Phasers firing.
			Activating shield invertors...
			now!
			Mister La Forge?
			La Forge here. Still breathing,
			Captain.
			Particulate levels are right where
			they're supposed to be... and the
			sun is shining!
			You see, sir, I told you there
			was nothing to worry about.
			Report back to the ship when
			you're ready, Commander.
			Doctor, we'll stay in orbit to
			analyze the remaining volcanic
			disturbances.
			I think the best advice might be
			to let them cool down on their
			own.
			I'm getting in the habit of
			thanking you, Picard.
			Well, I'd love to see more, but
			it's nearly time for me to go.
			I'm tickled pink to have had the
			opportunity of witnessing this,
			Picard.
			And you did it all without any
			help.
			I must run. I've got some packing
			to do.
			You know, you're taller in person.
			Would you look at this. Who would
			have suspected a teary farewell?
			I'm afraid we're going to have
			to take a look in your vessel,
			Professor.
			Curious till the end, eh, Captain?
			You can't be serious, Picard.
			We've been through this more than
			once and I...
			A number of objects have turned
			up missing in the last few days.
			If they are in your possession,
			I would like them returned.
			I'm not here in search of relics.
			I'm sure they'll turn up.
			If you will not open the vessel,
			I will... with explosives, if
			necessary.
			I doubt you have the means.
			If we don't get in that thing,
			I guarantee you won't either.
			Considering the sensitive nature
			of my equipment, I think you'll
			understand if I request that only
			Mister Data be allowed to see it.
			Why Data?
			Because if I order Data never to
			divulge what he sees in there,
			he won't.
			With the exception of anything
			that might belong to us.
			Understood, sir.
			Back in a minute.
			I do not believe any of these
			items belong to you, Professor.
			Nor does this!
			This phaser is set at the highest
			stun setting. If I'm correct,
			that is sufficient to immobilize
			even you.
			Do you plan to put these objects
			into a museum?
			They're far too valuable for that.
			You see, in the century I come
			from, they haven't even been
			invented yet.
			But this vessel... ? And the
			temporal distortion that coincided
			with your arrival?
			Oh, this is a time-pod. And it
			is from the twenty-sixth
			century... at least that's what
			the poor fellow said. You see,
			he decided to travel back to the
			twenty-second century... that's
			my time, and he had the misfortune
			of meeting me... His clothes
			fit quite well, don't you think?
			Took me weeks to figure out how
			to work this thing.
			You are not an historian?
			More of an inventor. Up till a
			few weeks ago, a dismally
			unsuccessful one.
			What are your intentions, now?
			Well, thanks to your captain, it
			seems my intentions have changed
			slightly.
			I was quite content with the
			notion of returning with those
			trinkets. I'd "invent" about one
			a year. But now, look what
			fortune has graced me with...
			You will take a little longer to
			figure out than a tricorder, but
			it should be well worth the
			effort.
			If the auto-timer is programmed
			the way I think it is...
			in about two minutes we'll be on
			our way back to a place called
			New Jersey... I'm afraid you
			won't be awake for the ride.
			I assume your hand print will open
			the door whether you are conscious
			or not.
			That weapon was working yesterday.
			You were correct to suspect him,
			sir. But he is from the past,
			not the future.
			Trying to make my history unfold
			in a way other than it already
			has, Professor?
			This was all a misunderstanding,
			Picard. Just let me back in there
			and we'll forget the whole thing.
			Now what possible incentive could
			anyone offer me to allow that?
			I believe you will find all the
			missing items in the vessel, sir.
			Doctor...
			A very nice performance.
			Not all of it. Some of it was
			real.
			Captain...
			He claims to be a twenty-second
			century inventor, sir.
			Well, it's too bad you weren't
			a bit more inventive. If fewer
			things had disappeared, we might
			not have suspected you. As it
			was, our only stumbling block was
			your vessel. Our sensors couldn't
			penetrate it.
			But as soon as the door opened,
			our computer was able to detect
			and deactivate everything you'd
			stolen...
			... including this.
			I'd love to hear more, Picard,
			but I really must get back in that
			pod.
			Take him to a detention cell,
			Mister Worf. And notify Starfleet
			that we'll be dropping him off
			at Starbase Two-one-four.
			You can't do this... I've got
			to get back... I don't belong
			here.
			No!
			I'm sure there are more than a
			few legitimate historians at
			Starfleet who will be quite eager
			to meet a Human from your era.
			Oh, and Professor...
			Welcome to the twenty-fourth
			century.
