			Captain's log, stardate 45429.3.
			While on a mapping survey of
			sector two-two-one-three-nine, we
			are conveying a delegation of
			Ullians to Kaldra Four. These
			telepathic historians conduct their
			research by retrieving long-forgotten
			memories.
			It's a chipped cup, off-white...
			with a crack in it... I can see
			it... but I can't remember
			anything else about it...
			When you see it... do you hear
			any sounds?
			No... I don't think so... wait,
			yes...
			Humming...
			Someone's humming...
			A woman.
			Yes... but I don't know who it
			is...
			Try to touch the cup.
			It has a sharp edge where it's
			chipped.
			Is there anything inside the cup?
			A liquid... dark...
			Like tea...
			It's not hot...
			Bitter...
			There's something else in the
			cup...
			Yes... with a wooden handle...
			A spoon...
			No... It's more delicate than
			that.
			Reach for it.
			It's a brush! An ink brush.
			I hear that humming again.
			Keep listening to it, and hold
			out the brush. See if someone
			takes it from you.
			It's Obachan! My grandmother.
			She's doing brush writing. I
			remember it now!
			She used that cup for cleaning
			the brush, and it was my job to
			fill it with water and bring it
			to the table.
			I'd sit beside her and watch the
			most beautiful characters come
			from that brush. And the whole
			time, she'd be humming to herself.
			It's like it was yesterday.
			You remember such vivid details...
			it's remarkable.
			For years I've seen that old cup
			in my memory... but I could never
			recall what it was or why it was
			important.
			Thank you.
			You're very welcome, young lady.
			Perhaps someone else would care
			to try?
			You, madam... you're thinking of
			that first childhood kiss.
			Wouldn't you like to remember
			more about it?
			Father, you know you're not
			supposed to probe someone's
			memories unless they've given you
			permission.
			You're right... but sometimes with
			a beautiful woman -- I can't help
			myself.
			What about you, Commander? Any
			memories you feel like digging
			up?
			None that I'd want to share with
			an audience.
			I'd better be going... it's
			getting late.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Reports of the Ullians' remarkable
			feats have piqued my interest.
			I have invited the senior staff
			to a Captain's Dinner in honor
			of our guests.
			It is perplexing to me that the
			Ullians' ability to retrieve
			memory is so sought after. If
			an event is important enough to
			be recovered... why would it have
			been forgotten?
			It's not quite the same for us
			as it is for you, Data. You
			record every second of every event
			in your life...
			That is correct.
			And if you want to recall any one
			of those seconds, you just access
			the proper memory circuit.
			My understanding of the Human
			brain suggests that the process
			is the same for you.
			Each memory is encoded in chains
			of molecules, and when you want
			to retrieve it, you simply access
			the proper RNA sequence.
			Well, yeah, that's true...
			Then in what way is it different?
			Sometimes... There are memories
			we just can't tap into. For
			instance... I have no recollection
			of what I did on my last birthday.
			Birthdays are important
			occasions... you'd think I'd
			remember how I spent the day.
			But I can't even remember where
			I was.
			Deck two. On the other hand --
			I remember everything about the
			time I got my first pet... a
			Circassian cat. I was eight. I
			remember how funny he looked...
			how excited I was... it's as if
			it happened last week.
			Perhaps you remember the pleasant
			memories and forget the unpleasant
			ones?
			Well, not really. Sometimes the
			bad memories are the most intense
			of all.
			It would seem there is no
			predictable pattern to Human
			memory.
			It would seem.
			This "library" of ours has been
			in the planning stages for years
			-- a collection of the retrieved
			memories of races from many
			different star systems --
			What my son means to say is --
			we think of ourselves as
			"archaeologists of the mind." We
			believe that the history of a
			world is contained in the personal
			experiences of its people.
			Rather like the ancient oral
			historians of Earth.
			Exactly. The library we propose
			will be a vast storehouse of these
			individual memories.
			Sounds like quite a project...
			how long will it take to finish
			your studies on Kaldra?
			Many months. We have been working
			for years, and have surveyed only
			eleven planets in eight star
			systems.
			But it's our way of life. We
			wouldn't want to do anything else.
			Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us
			a demonstration of his abilities
			this afternoon. It's fascinating.
			Perhaps you'd like to resurrect
			some memories...
			I'd be happy to probe your
			recollections, Captain. Most
			people find it an enjoyable
			experience.
			I'm sure. However, I don't think
			I'm a particularly good candidate
			--
			I'm sure you'd be ideal. And you
			must have some intriguing
			memories...
			We won't be on your ship for long.
			This might be your last
			opportunity...
			Yes, well...
			Tarmin, you mustn't influence
			people. They must come to you
			willingly.
			I have found... over the years...
			that there are many who want the
			experience of memory retrieval...
			but who need some encouragement
			in order to come forward.
			You, Mister Worf? I would love
			to explore Klingon memories.
			Klingons do not allow themselves
			to be "probed."
			There is nothing to fear...
			Father...
			I am not fearful.
			Commander La Forge... you?
			I don't think so. Thanks anyway.
			I have rarely encountered such
			squeamish people! Doctor
			Crusher... Commander Riker... ?
			Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians
			able to read memories?
			No, my dear. The technique
			requires special training. It
			is a serious commitment.
			It takes years of study. Tarmin
			is the most proficient of our
			group.
			Once Jev spent two days with a
			contingent of elderly Gentons.
			He couldn't get a thing from them.
			I worked with them for one hour
			and recovered a missing fragment
			of the Gentonian trade wars.
			Excuse me.
			Exactly how long will it be before
			we reach Kaldra, Captain?
			Mister Data?
			Four days, eleven hours, sir.
			Jev...
			I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
			No, not at all...
			My father finds it amusing to
			demean me in public. I reach the
			point where I don't want to hear
			any more.
			It's not easy having an
			overbearing parent. Believe me,
			I know how you feel.
			Oh, yes... I was told you were
			an empath.
			I can't read Ullians. But, I
			do know a certain Betazoid mother
			who is a great deal like your
			father.
			Deck eight. I've learned to
			remind myself that my mother and
			I are two separate individuals.
			Deck sixteen. And have you had
			much success with this approach,
			Counselor?
			No... but I keep reminding myself.
			Good night.
			Good night, Counselor. And thank
			you.
			Have you stopped thinking about
			us?
			Hot chocolate.
			Have you stopped thinking about
			us?
			Will...
			We have to talk about this...
			Imzadi... we can't... not when
			we're serving on the same ship...
			Have you stopped thinking about
			us? Just answer that...
			I can't stop thinking about you...
			No... don't...
			Have you stopped thinking about
			us?
			Will... we mustn't do this...
			No, Will --
			Imzadi...
			No, don't...
			I can't stop thinking about
			you...
			Imzadi...
			Don't do this... !
			Have you stopped thinking about
			us?
			No... no... no...
			Captain's log, stardate 45430.9.
			Counselor Troi has fallen into
			a deep coma. After a thorough
			examination, Doctor Crusher has
			been unable to find any sign of
			illness or infection.
			Any change, Doctor?
			No. I'm still getting unusual
			neurotransmitter readings in the
			diencephalon... but they might
			be a result of the coma...
			Can you bring her out of it?
			I've tried standard revival
			techniques... she doesn't
			respond. Until I know what caused
			this, I don't want to try anything
			more extreme.
			Do we know what she was doing when
			this happened?
			No. She was found in her quarters
			this morning when she didn't show
			up for an appointment.
			She was dressed for bed... but
			the bed wasn't slept in.
			Who was the last person to speak
			with her?
			She left the dinner last night
			with one of the Ullians.
			I'll talk to him.
			I'll check the biofilter readings
			from the Ullians' transporter logs.
			It's possible they could still be
			carrying some harmful organism.
			Commander, ask if they would
			consent to examinations -- just
			to be certain.
			May I join you?
			Commander... of course...
			Something's wrong...
			Counselor Troi is ill.
			I'm sorry to hear it...
			More than ill... she's in a coma.
			Doctor Crusher doesn't know what's
			causing it or how to treat her.
			When did it happen?
			Apparently some time last night.
			That's why I wanted to talk to
			you... you may have been the last
			person to see her. Did you go
			with her into her quarters?
			Are you suggesting I behaved
			improperly, Commander?
			Not at all... I'm just trying to
			trace her steps.
			We talked briefly -- in a
			turbolift. She got off at deck
			eight. I did not go with her.
			Jev -- I'm not accusing you of
			anything.
			Did she mention feeling ill?
			No. She seemed fine.
			She has a wonderful sense of
			humor.
			If you have no objection, Doctor
			Crusher would like to examine you
			and your group...
			To what end?
			She'd like to eliminate the
			possibility that one of you might
			be carrying some organism that
			was harmful to Deanna.
			I'm not implying that you've done
			anything intentional. I am just
			trying to get to the bottom of
			a mystery...
			We have nothing to hide. If you
			wish to spend time examining us...
			Fine. Thank you.
			Deanna... I don't know if you can
			hear me.
			I've heard doctors say that even
			when someone's in a coma, they
			may be able to hear when people
			talk to them... that it might
			even help stimulate the brain
			and speed the healing...
			In fact, I think you did that for
			me once, when I was in pretty
			bad shape...
			So I just thought... maybe it
			would help to hear a friendly
			voice...
			... even if you don't know you're
			hearing it.
			We've been busy mapping the
			sector... it's pretty routine.
			So far the most unusual thing
			we've seen is a binary star
			system... I finished that
			personnel review we were working
			on... you can check it over when
			you...
			... wake up.
			I miss you. So don't stay away
			too long, okay?
			Will... ?
			Will... I promise I'll let you
			know the minute she regains
			consciousness.
			I know...
			There's nothing you can do here.
			You're going to wear yourself
			out...
			Right...
			It's late... go to bed.
			That's an order.
			Keller is still in there!
			Out, out, out! Let's go!
			Antimatter injection breach.
			Evacuate immediately.
			Ensign Keller, can you hear me?
			Yes, sir...
			Come on, move it!
			Commander, I need to bring that
			door down!
			Keller, can you get to a Jeffries
			Tube?
			Ensign Keller, answer me.
			You killed her.
			Keller is still in there!
			Commander, radiation levels are
			critical -- we've gotta seal it
			off.
			She was right behind me!
			Bring down the door!
			Out, out out! Let's go!
			Keller is still in there.
			Keller is still in there.
			Riker to transporter room three.
			Prepare to beam Ensign Keller out
			of the engine room.
			I can't lock onto her signal,
			Commander.
			Keller is still in there.
			Keller is still in there.
			You killed her.
			Ensign Keller, answer me.
			You killed her.
			I've gotta get the isolation door
			down!
			Keller is still in there.
			Bring down the door!
			You killed her.
			You killed her.
			You killed her.
			I need that door down!
			Keller is still in there.
			You killed her.
			Bridge to Commander Riker...
			Commander, do you read me?
			Picard to Commander Riker, answer
			please.
			Computer, locate Commander Riker.
			Commander Riker is in his
			quarters.
			On my way, sir.
			Medical log, stardate 45431.7.
			Commander Riker is the second
			officer who has fallen into an
			unexplained coma. I have examined
			the Ullians and ruled out the
			possibility that they carry a
			harmful organism.
			I compared Deanna's brain scan
			to one I took during her last
			physical. There is a
			difference... this time there's
			a trace of electropathic activity.
			And Commander Riker?
			I found the same pattern. If I
			didn't know better, I'd think they
			had Iresine Syndrome. It's the
			only medical condition that would
			produce that pattern.
			What is Iresine Syndrome?
			A very rare neurological disorder
			first diagnosed in the
			twenty-third century. It's
			characterized by an identical
			electropathic residue.
			Then why discount the possibility
			that it's responsible for their
			comas?
			Iresine is always accompanied by
			a severely decreased histamine
			count. Both Will and Deanna show
			normal levels.
			I've asked Commander La Forge to
			conduct a shipwide diagnostic
			for any other agents which could
			produce that electropathic
			pattern.
			Counselor Troi and Commander Riker
			were in perfect health -- until
			the Ullians got here.
			It would be wise to quarantine
			the aliens.
			I believe it's premature to take
			that kind of action. We have no
			real evidence linking these comas
			to the Ullians.
			That's true. But there is
			something curious...
			The electropathic residue I
			discovered is located in the
			thalamus. That's the area of the
			cerebral cortex which involves
			memory function.
			I've been accused of putting
			people to sleep with one too many
			stories, Captain... but this is
			the first time it's been suggested
			that I might be responsible for
			someone's coma.
			I mean no disrespect, sir. But
			we are faced with an alarming
			situation...
			Why do you suspect us, Captain?
			Suspect is perhaps too strong a
			word. I am simply trying to
			determine what has caused two of
			my officers to fall into comas.
			You've already examined us...
			we aren't carrying anything
			harmful...
			But in further study of the
			victims, I noticed some abnormal
			patterns in the area of the brain
			which involves memory.
			In light of your particular
			telepathic abilities, it does
			raise the question...
			Captain... it's not our wish to
			obstruct you. What would you
			like?
			If I could do further examinations
			tomorrow... perhaps monitor you
			during a memory probe...
			Scrutiny does not frighten us.
			We will be happy to cooperate,
			Doctor.
			Thank you. I'll contact you
			tomorrow morning.
			You're the only person on board
			who's undergone a memory probe
			by the Ullians. I'd like to do
			a neurological work-up... see
			if I can detect any residual
			effect.
			I'm happy to help...
			Doctor Martin will monitor your
			vital signs while I do the scan.
			Have you had any unusual symptoms
			since the probe? Headaches?
			Dizziness?
			No, nothing like that. It was
			a wonderful experience...
			Electrical activity is normal...
			CPK levels are normal... the
			hippocampus is stable... and the
			thalamus...
			... the thalamus is normal.
			There's no indication at all of
			the electropathic residue.
			Is that good?
			You're fine, Keiko. But we're
			no closer to solving this mystery.
			Computer, locate the electropathic
			pattern described in medical
			database four-delta-one.
			Electropathic pattern located.
			Okay, we're gonna track down any
			possible cause of that brain
			pattern. First, what are the
			medical conditions that might
			account for it?
			Iresine Syndrome is a cause of
			the electropathic pattern.
			Right. And Doctor Crusher's
			already eliminated that. How many
			nonmedical forces or substances
			might cause the pattern?
			There are twenty-two nonmedical
			agents.
			Okay. And how many of those are
			present on the Enterprise?
			None is present on the Enterprise.
			Are the ship's sensors calibrated
			to detect all those agents?
			All agents are scanned by the
			sensors.
			Okay. Let's start with the
			chemical substances. Name them.
			Ferrazene, hylanatine, dardilion,
			chrysimite, and manzene.
			Ferrazene has a complex molecular
			structure... it breaks down into
			bilenium and tarrisite. Do the
			sensors scan for those?
			Ship's sensors scan for both
			compounds.
			And are they present on the
			Enterprise?
			Bilenium and tarrisite are not
			present.
			Do any of the substances break
			down into by-products that are
			not scanned for?
			Dardilion contains the byproduct
			nilizene. Sensors do not
			routinely scan for that substance.
			Well, this isn't a routine
			situation. Scan for nilizene.
			There is no nilizene on the
			Enterprise.
			Why did I know you were going to
			say that?
			Okay. Let's move on to
			nonchemical agents.
			Anything more I can do for you?
			No, thanks. I was just doing some
			reading on Iresine Syndrome. If
			a new strain has developed, that
			might explain the normal histamine
			count.
			Any luck?
			Not so far.
			Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
			You shouldn't remember him like
			this.
			You don't have to do this...
			It's important to me. I have to
			see him.
			It's good of you to come with me.
			It's the least I can do...
			You shouldn't remember him like
			this.
			I have to face the fact that he's
			gone.
			I have to see him.
			You shouldn't remember him like
			this...
			It's good of you to come with me.
			It's the least I can do...
			You don't have to do this...
			It's important to me.
			You shouldn't remember him like
			this...
			It's the least I can do...
			I've spent two hours having a cozy
			chat with the computer. I've
			checked everything I can think
			of -- any possible agent that
			might cause that electropathic
			pattern.
			I would assume from the tone of
			your voice that you were
			unsuccessful.
			Didn't find a thing.
			And the Doctor's not gonna like
			hearing that --
			Emergency medical team to Doctor
			Crusher's office immediately.
			Doctor Crusher had me working on
			a shipwide diagnostic. I'd gone
			to give her the results when I
			found her.
			Did your scans provide any
			insights into these comas?
			None. I checked and
			cross-checked... they were just
			dead ends.
			We seem to have eliminated all
			known factors that could have
			caused the comas -- except for
			the Ullians.
			Mister Data, I want you to
			investigate those eleven planets
			the Ullians have visited. See
			if there have been any reports
			of unexplained comas.
			Yes, Captain.
			In the meantime, we must consider
			restricting them to their
			quarters. As a precautionary
			measure...
			If one of them is behind this...
			will keeping telepaths in their
			quarters prevent it from happening
			again?
			What else can we do? Station a
			guard? Set up a force field?
			I don't know if those would be
			any more effective...
			Sickbay to Captain Picard.
			Picard here...
			Sir... Counselor Troi has regained
			consciousness.
			I'm on my way.
			It's like waking up from a
			nightmare... but not remembering
			what it was about.
			What's the last thing you do
			remember?
			My hair... I was brushing my hair.
			And then... ?
			I don't know... just... waking
			up here...
			Why do I feel so frightened? What
			happened to me?
			We were hoping you could tell us.
			How long have I been here?
			Three days.
			Three days... ?
			You were the first. The next day
			Commander Riker fell into a
			similar coma... and last night
			-- Doctor Crusher.
			What is going on here... ?
			We aren't certain.
			It may be... that there is some
			unusual effect produced by the
			Ullians' telepathic activity.
			I'm going to talk to them. In
			the meantime, you're to stay here
			and recuperate. And if you
			remember anything about what
			happened to you... let me know
			immediately.
			What are you suggesting, Captain?
			That you voluntarily confine
			yourself to quarters. At least
			until we unravel this mystery.
			We're to be prisoners?
			Father...
			Please don't think of it that way.
			We have done everything we can
			think of to explain these comas.
			We've performed physical
			examinations and neurological
			scans... we have conducted a
			shipwide diagnostic, looking for
			viruses and parasites and
			infestations...
			We have investigated every
			possible cause we can imagine.
			And we have found nothing --
			nothing -- to explain the comas.
			The only variable we cannot
			eliminate... is your presence
			on this ship.
			In light of these efforts, I ask
			you to understand my request.
			And to honor it.
			Captain... our history indicates
			that we do not adversely affect
			the people we contact.
			I know that.
			Then... are you implying an
			intentional assault?
			I am simply trying to consider
			all possibilities.
			Surely you would give us the
			chance to prove that we are
			innocent?
			If that is possible, of course.
			Then... I would propose doing a
			memory probe of Counselor Troi.
			You've said she doesn't remember
			what happened to her before she
			lapsed into unconsciousness. I
			could retrieve that memory...
			There's a possibility it could
			explain the coma -- and prove us
			innocent.
			I'm sorry. But I cannot subject
			the Counselor to a potentially
			dangerous procedure.
			And I will not be a party to any
			of these proceedings.
			Jev is making a reasonable
			request, Captain. If we're to
			be accused, surely we're entitled
			to a defense.
			Tarmin did a memory probe on
			another of your crew... Has she
			suffered any ill effects?
			No...
			And neither will Counselor Troi.
			Please... have as many people
			present as you like to guarantee
			her safety... but give us this
			chance to vindicate ourselves.
			I will discuss the matter with
			the Counselor.
			Well, that's it for Melina Two.
			No unexplained comas during the
			time the Ullians were working
			there. We're striking out
			everywhere.
			We have yet to receive
			transmissions from the two planets
			of the Nel system. Perhaps they
			will show different results.
			Maybe...
			Or maybe... we're not checking
			for the right thing.
			Please clarify.
			We didn't look into the comas
			that were explained.
			Why would we do that?
			Remember what Doctor Crusher said
			right after Counselor Troi became
			unconscious? That it looked
			exactly like Iresine syndrome
			except for the histamine count?
			Yes.
			Maybe not every medical facility
			is as careful as Doctor Crusher.
			Maybe it's easier to give a quick
			diagnosis to something than to
			keep hunting for the real cause.
			You are checking for instances
			of Iresine Syndrome...
			Right... and correlating them with
			visits by the Ullians --
			-- and there we are.
			Two cases of Iresine Syndrome on
			Hurada Three -- right at the time
			Tarmin and his group was there.
			Let's try the other planets. I
			think we may have something.
			Counselor, I want to reiterate...
			if you have any doubts about this
			procedure, you don't have to
			go through with it.
			I want to do it, Captain.
			Something awful happened to me...
			and I can't even remember what
			it was.
			Very well.
			Counselor... what's the last thing
			you remember that night?
			Brushing my hair...
			Would you get your hairbrush?
			Tell me about brushing your
			hair... do you do it every night?
			Yes... when I'm ready for bed...
			What is it?
			Someone... touching my hair...
			Someone's with you in the room?
			No... I'm alone. No one's there.
			I get some hot chocolate...
			Something's happening...
			I'm alone in my quarters... and
			I'm remembering something from
			a few years ago...
			Go back... into that memory...
			you said someone was touching
			your hair... ?
			Yes... and...
			It's Will Riker... that's right...
			I was thinking of him...
			Remembering a time when you were
			with him...
			Yes... after a poker game...
			It's a pleasant memory... stay
			with it...
			... but now he's hurting me...
			no...
			You're frightened...
			I want him to stop...
			It's not Will... somebody's taken
			his place...
			Someone else is there? Who is
			it?
			No... no... he shouldn't be
			there... why is he there? No...
			no... he's hurting me...
			Can you see his face... ?
			Yes...
			Imzadi...
			No... stop... you're hurting me...
			Who is it? Who's doing this to
			you?
			It's Tarmin... it's your father!
			Captain's log, stardate 45433.2.
			We have set a course for Starbase
			Four-forty, where the Ullians will
			disembark and return to their home
			planet.
			Inad and I have contacted our home
			planet. If you want to prosecute
			my father, the authorities there
			will support you.
			I'm not sure we have any legal
			basis for prosecution... memory
			invasion simply isn't a crime
			we've ever had to contend with.
			According to what I've just
			learned... it was a practice that
			was abolished on our world
			centuries ago.
			What would motivate someone like
			your father to commit such an act?
			I don't know. A perverse source
			of pleasure... a way to exercise
			control over another... ?
			Your father claims -- quite
			strenuously -- that he is
			innocent.
			My father has never been one to
			admit that he's wrong.
			But it's hard to believe he would
			be capable of this.
			This must be very hard for you.
			I am told... that the punishment
			for this crime is quite severe.
			We are monitoring his telepathic
			activity. You have my assurance
			that he won't assault anyone
			else.
			I am sorry for this, Captain.
			Picard to Data.
			Yes, Captain.
			How's your search coming?
			We have uncovered several cases,
			sir, but we have not yet completed
			our search.
			We'll want to inform the medical
			personnel on those planets that
			we have discovered the true nature
			of the comas. I'm sure they would
			appreciate knowing what really
			happened.
			We will keep searching, sir.
			We just got the transmission from
			the Nel system. No mention of
			Iresine Syndrome... but there are
			two unexplained comas on one
			planet... none on the other.
			And were the Ullians present?
			Checking their mission logs...
			That's funny...
			What is it?
			On stardates 45321 and 45323, when
			the comas occurred... Tarmin was
			on his home planet.
			He wasn't anywhere near the Nel
			system.
			Come in.
			Hello, Jev.
			We'll be reaching the starbase
			soon. I wanted to say good-bye...
			and to apologize again for my
			father.
			There's no need... you're not
			responsible for what he did.
			Before all this happened... I had
			hoped we might become friends.
			We still can...
			After what he's put you through?
			Maybe you can forget... I'm not
			sure I can.
			You are so lovely...
			I have to go. Good-bye.
			Jev... you're upset. Would you
			like to talk?
			No...
			You'd feel better if you did...
			Why do you have to be so nice...
			So lovely...
			What... what's happening... ?
			It's happening again...
			You are so beautiful... so
			fragile...
			It was you... it was always you...
			Have you stopped thinking about
			us?
			No...
			Imzadi...
			Imzadi...
			No -- no --
			No -- I won't let you!
			Let go of her!
			Counselor, are you hurt?
			No... why... why did you come
			here? How did you know?
			We discovered two instances of
			unexplained comas on Nel Three
			while the Ullians were there...
			but Tarmin was not part of the
			group. A closer examination
			revealed that only one Ullian was
			present at all incidents of coma
			-- Jev.
			Captain's log, stardate 45435.8.
			Doctor Crusher and Commander Riker
			regained consciousness while we
			were en route to the Ullian home
			world. The slow process of their
			recovery has begun.
			I have asked that the finest
			physicians on my world meet with
			you all upon our return... to help
			you in your healing process.
			They have been in contact with
			us already. Thank you...
			It has been three centuries since
			anyone was treated for this...
			this form of rape. But there are
			medical records from that era...
			It was a time of great violence
			among my people... a time we
			thought we had left far behind.
			That this could happen now...
			is unimaginable.
			Earth was once a violent planet,
			too. At times, the chaos seemed
			to threaten the very fabric of
			life.
			Like you, we have evolved. We've
			learned to find better ways to
			handle our conflicts.
			But no one would deny that a seed
			of violence remains in every one
			of us. The potential for it is
			always there. We must learn to
			recognize it... because that
			violence is capable of consuming
			each of us. Just as it consumed
			your son.
