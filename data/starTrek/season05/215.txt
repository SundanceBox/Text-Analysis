			Captain's log, stardate 45571.2.
			We are going into orbit around
			an unexplored M-class moon of
			Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was
			reported to be uninhabited, we
			have picked up a weak distress
			call.
			The intense electromagnetic
			whirlwinds on the moon's surface
			make it virtually impossible to
			locate the source of the signal,
			sir...
			Any indications of life, Mister
			Worf?
			Scanners read negative, sir. But
			they may be affected by the
			interference.
			Have you ever heard anything like
			that, Data?
			I believe so, Commander... at
			Starfleet Academy...
			The Academy?
			Yes, sir, let me verify it...
			As I thought, sir... it is a
			Starfleet subspace distress
			signal... standard to Daedalus
			class starships...
			There hasn't been a Daedalus class
			in service for... what... ?
			One hundred seventy-two years,
			Commander...
			Any record of missing ships in
			this vicinity, Data?
			The U.S.S. Essex under the command
			of Captain Bryce Shumar
			disappeared in this sector over
			two centuries ago...
			Daedalus class...
			Yes, Captain... I have accessed
			the subspace transponder signature
			of the Essex... it is identical
			to the signal coming from the moon's
			surface...
			We've arrived a little late...
			Mute it, Data.
			With the storm activity down
			there, I don't think it's worth
			the risk to check on a ghost ship,
			Number One... advise Starfleet
			we've solved the mystery of
			Captain Shumar and the Essex...
			I'm not sure we have...
			Someone's down there... alive...
			First officer's log, supplemental.
			The electromagnetic interference
			on the surface was judged too
			dangerous for anyone to transport
			down. So we have taken a
			shuttle to investigate.
			Shields are holding...
			Wind shear is incredible, Data...
			keep an eye on the stabilizers...
			If it's anything like this on the
			ground, I don't see how anyone
			could survive on this moon for
			long.
			Maybe they've been living
			underground.
			Question is where? I still can't
			locate the source of the damn
			signal... it's bouncing around
			more than we are...
			Sir, forward thrusters have
			failed. We are losing power.
			Enterprise... ?
			Go ahead.
			We've lost our thrusters...
			attempting to compensate with
			secondary boosters...
			Sir? The shuttle's impulse
			generators have shut down...
			Commander? Can you hear me?
			Enterprise to shuttle, please
			respond.
			Hold on! We're going down...
			Initiating emergency landing
			procedures...
			Maintain the approach attitude
			Data... I'm taking her in...
			The shuttle has crashed on the
			surface...
			Do you have their position?
			I am picking up the shuttle's
			trace signature... but the surface
			interference is distorting its
			position...
			Can you locate them...
			I think I can... I followed their
			entry almost all the way in...
			we can calculate the coordinates
			from their angle of descent...
			Enterprise?
			It is unlikely, sir, that we will
			be able to establish communication
			with the ship, given the severe
			electromagnetic interference...
			Then we'll stay put right here
			until the Enterprise finds us...
			Data, run an inventory of what's
			still usable inside the shuttle.
			Yes sir.
			Your arm...
			Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's
			broken...
			The surface is composed of
			nonporous rock... makes me
			think it's even more unlikely
			anyone could live here...
			There are no instruments left of
			practical value that have not been
			damaged by the impact of our
			landing.
			What is that?
			Doesn't look like any storm front
			I've ever seen...
			The tricorder is picking up high
			levels of E-M bursts across the
			spectrum.
			Are you picking up anything else,
			Data... like signs of life... ?
			Other than our own, sir...
			negative.
			There is someone alive here...
			I'm more certain of it now than
			ever...
			Well, I hope they can find us...
			because we don't have a way to
			find them...
			They're coming... they're coming
			with the storm...
			We can't get a pattern lock on
			the communicators because of the
			E-M bursts, Captain. There's
			no way to beam them out of
			there... not under these
			conditions...
			The same conditions won't permit
			a shuttle to land safely, Mister
			LaForge... any suggestions... ?
			Sir, let me beam down with a
			pattern enhancer...
			Chief, there's no guarantee you
			won't rematerialize in a million
			pieces if your signal gets caught
			up in that electromagnetic
			whirlwind...
			I can boost the confinement
			beam. One person might be able
			to make it...
			Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to
			beam down to the surface with a
			pattern enhancer...
			His chances of getting down there
			safely are no better than fifty-
			fifty in my judgement...
			Captain, a major storm front is
			moving in on the away team's
			coordinates...
			Mister O'Brien... you are aware
			of the risks?
			Yessir. I think I can make it.
			Prepare to transport.
			Aye, sir.
			Glad you could join us.
			Great spot for a picnic, sir.
			We need to distribute the enhancer
			rods at seven meter legs... that
			ought to do it...
			Storm front going to affect the
			transport, Chief... ?
			I'd really like to get us out of
			here before it hits, Commander...
			see, I'm supposed to be feeding
			the baby lunch... Molly gets in
			a terribly foul mood if I'm
			late...
			I'm with you...
			Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do
			it!
			Easy, Deanna...
			W-where... ?
			You're back on the Enterprise...
			Everything's okay now.
			But my skin... It's tingling.
			You are experiencing some
			afterimages from the
			electromagnetic discharge. The
			sensation will pass. Try to
			relax...
			They're all fine, too. Now take
			your time, Counselor, okay?
			Doctor's orders.
			Injury report, Doctor?
			Mostly minor abrasions. But
			Commander Riker took the worst
			of it with a broken arm... The
			biofilter scans showed their
			nervous systems were generating
			unusally high levels of synaptic
			energy. I don't think it's
			anything to worry about...
			Good work, Mister O'Brien.
			Thank you, sir.
			Ready for duty, Captain.
			Are you sure, Number One?
			It's not the first bone I've
			broken.
			And how are you, Counselor?
			Very glad to be here.
			What happened down there?
			It was just one hell of a storm...
			moved in on our position faster
			than anything I've ever seen.
			Did you find any evidence of
			life?
			No, but if Troi was right, we
			weren't far away from it...
			Bridge.
			How do you suggest we proceed?
			We're gonna have to find a way
			to modify the scanners to
			penetrate those storms. Got any
			ideas, Data... ?
			It is p-p-possible we might be
			able to employ virtual imaging
			to interpolate missing data...
			Is there something wrong, Data?
			My apologies. It seems my primary
			speech processors are experiencing
			a minor fluctuation. I will have
			it corrected in a... m-m-moment.
			Captain... may I speak with you
			a moment? In private?
			Of course, Counselor.
			Take the bridge, Number One.
			Mister Data, deploy sensor scans
			when you're ready. Ensign, move
			into a synchronous orbit aligned
			with our crash site.
			Aye sir.
			Sir? Given the E-M field
			properties of this moon, I would
			recommend a search pattern
			beginning at the southern
			p-p-polar region.
			The polar region... But that's
			starting from scratch, Data. The
			last reading we had on the Essex
			would suggest we begin the scans
			near our crash site...
			The Essex signal was never clearly
			located, sir.
			A broader, systematic survey of
			the moon from a p-p-polar orbit
			might be more practical.
			Well, you might be right. Still,
			I'd like to give the crash site
			a once-over first... We'll
			maintain our present orbit for
			now.
			Understood, sir.
			I've never felt anything quite
			like it... It was almost as though
			they were calling to me...
			Are you saying someone was
			communicating telepathically,
			Counselor?
			Perhaps. For an instant. It was
			like their voices were carried
			on the wind.
			What were they trying to
			communicate?
			I'm not sure... but they were
			calling me to the southern polar
			region... I believe that's where
			we should look for the Essex...
			Commander? Did you override my
			orbital heading?
			Override them?
			We've moved into a polar orbit.
			I'm locked out, the helm isn't
			responding...
			Mister Data, do you know anything
			about this?
			Data... ?
			Security to the bridge!
			Computer, transfer command to
			engineering... Full security
			alert!
			All command functions transferred
			to engineering.
			This way!
			What happened?
			He would not move to a polar
			orbit.
			You could not wait? The captain
			would have done it for me...
			Deck thirty-six. Engineering.
			Computer, reenable bridge
			control. Authorization:
			Riker-Omega-Three...
			Report...
			They're in turbolift four.
			Engaging turbolift override
			controls, now...
			They have t-t-trapped us... what
			will we do?
			What deck is this?
			We are on deck ten.
			Can you move us again?
			I know how to override the bridge
			command...
			Activate all security fields on
			decks eight through fifteen...
			Sir? The turbolift is moving
			again. They're still inside.
			Initiate emergency bulkheads in
			turboshaft four...
			Aye, sir.
			They've been stopped at deck
			thirteen.
			Mister Worf...
			Do you know how to deactivate
			this?
			The computer will not allow us
			to override an emergency
			forcefield command...
			My entity's artificial
			substructure may be useful...
			They've broken through a security
			field, deck ten, section two...
			Security to Ten Forward...
			Shh... Mama's right here...
			Everyone get down on the floor!
			Miles... ?
			On the floor!
			Everyone down! Now!!
			Multiple phaser shots in Ten
			Forward.
			Picard to Worf -- report.
			Mister Worf... acknowledge.
			Can you hear me, Lieutenant Worf?
			Yes, bridge. He can hear you.
			Position security teams at both
			entrances...
			Yes sir.
			Mister La Forge, shut down all
			computer access in Ten
			Forward...
			I can't, Captain. They've already
			set up a remote security
			lock-out... We'd have to shut down
			all computer functions in the
			saucer section...
			Transporter room three, can you
			get a pattern lock on Commander
			Data, Counselor Troi and Chief
			O'Brien in Ten Forward... ?
			Attempting to lock on, sir...
			You were correct. They are
			attempting to engage their
			transporters. But I know how to
			shut them down.
			Bridge, the entire transporter
			array has been taken off-line and
			placed in a diagnostic mode...
			I can't override... it will take
			a couple of hours to complete the
			cycle...
			How many people are down there?
			Seventeen...
			They just shut down the internal
			scanners too, Captain.
			Doctor Crusher to the bridge...
			On my way.
			What are you doing now?
			I can reverse the p-polarity of
			their forcefields to isolate this
			room.
			Good.
			Their communicators. Now they
			will learn nothing but what we
			tell them.
			They've done something to the
			force fields on deck ten, section
			one.
			Geordi?
			I don't recognize the
			configurations...
			But they've completely isolated
			Ten Forward.
			How about flooding their air vents
			with anesthizine gas?
			That won't affect Data. No
			rescue plan will work if we don't
			knock out all three of them.
			A concussive charge would blow
			out the security field. Then we
			could go in with phasers on wide
			beam. Stun everybody. Sort it
			out later...
			Doctor, go back to the biofilter
			readouts taken during the away
			team's transport from the moon's
			surface... see if you can come
			up with any kind of clue that
			might explain this...
			Ten Forward, this is Captain
			Picard. I am prepared to discuss
			this situation. There is no need
			for further violence...
			Please identify yourself.
			They will now attempt to negotiate
			for the safety and release of
			their people.
			Interesting. Under normal
			circumstances, I would be
			counseling the captain at a time
			like this...
			What would you tell him to do?
			I would help him find a way to
			secure our trust.
			W-what are you looking at?
			I am speaking to you, Klingon.
			Attack me. Or are you afraid?
			I have no fear of death.
			And I have no fear of killing
			you...
			Stop it.
			Please respond, Ten Forward. Are
			there any members of my crew who
			require medical assistance?
			We can discuss your wounded,
			Captain. But first, you will move
			the ship.
			Move it where?
			You will will change the ship's
			orbit to an inclination of eighty
			degrees, south.
			The southern polar region --
			that's where Data tried to move
			the ship.
			And exactly what Troi asked me
			to do, but why?
			Ten Forward -- if you could be
			more specific about our intended
			destination, perhaps we could...
			You have thirty seconds to change
			your heading -- or additional
			members of your crew will "require
			medical attention."
			We need to stabilize this
			situation and play for time. I
			suggest we move the ship as they
			have asked. Agreed?
			Set the new heading. But take
			us there as slowly as you can...
			Ten Forward, we are moving the
			ship as you requested.
			He's telling the truth... their
			heading has changed...
			I've compared the away team's last
			transport trace patterns to
			earlier records. They're exactly
			the same, except in Troi, Data and
			O'Brien there's an unusual
			synaptic activity -- some kind
			of anionic energy. It may be a
			life-form superimposing neural
			patterns onto our people.
			Why wasn't I affected?
			I don't know. But one difference
			between you and the others was
			that you were injured.
			My broken arm...
			The fracture caused pain receptors
			to fire which may have made you
			immune... to this energy.
			If your theory is accurate, what
			would happen if we inflicted pain
			on the others...
			That might force whatever it is
			out of our people.
			A plasma shock -- it would be
			painful but it wouldn't cause any
			physical harm.
			I could hook up a modified laser
			scanner to a plasma invertor...
			What about Data?
			A plasma shock would certainly
			overload his neural net. It might
			work for him too...
			We'd have to find a way to
			penetrate the forcefield around
			Ten Forward.
			I might be able to interrupt the
			forcefield for a few seconds...
			but I'll be fighting the computer
			for control... timing would be
			critical...
			We'd have to hit all three with
			a single discharge... if they're
			standing together, it shouldn't
			be a problem...
			How would you gain access?
			We could use a micro-optic drill
			through the ceiling and they'd
			never detect it...
			If this is going to work, we need
			some way to contain that anionic
			energy after we get it out of our
			people.
			Yes, Doctor... that will be your
			top priority.
			Very well. Proceed.
			Bridge to Ten Forward. Now that
			we are moving the ship as you
			requested, I would like to know
			the nature of the injuries to
			members of my crew.
			Five of your people have been
			injured.
			How serious is their condition?
			You tell him, Klingon.
			Captain. One person has
			suffered what looks like a level
			five phaser hit...
			And four others have secondary
			burns. They require medical
			attention...
			And our captors are not affected
			by phaser stun settings...
			Silence, Klingon.
			Ten Forward -- those people must
			be released so they can receive
			proper medical treatment.
			I will release no one.
			If you release the wounded...
			I will take their place.
			It may be a... d-deception.
			The crew values Picard's life
			above all others...
			Captain Picard. We agree to your
			proposal.
			Expect a medical team to accompany
			me.
			Acknowledged.
			Picard to sickbay. Send an
			emergency medical team to meet
			me outside Ten Forward.
			Sir, putting you down there just
			strengthens their position.
			As long as they're on board, I'm
			a hostage no matter where I am.
			We all are. I must find out who
			we are dealing with...
			If La Forge and Ro can attempt
			a rescue in short order, proceed
			with it. If they can't... I'll
			provide you with another
			opportunity. Watch for it.
			Yes, sir...
			Silence that... ch-child!
			I know you. I know who you
			are...
			And I know who this is...
			She's frightened... why don't you
			let us go?
			No. Make it stop.
			Ten Forward, we are outside the
			door.
			Lower the force field.
			Welcome, Captain. Allow me to
			introduce myself...
			I am Captain Bryce Shumar, of the
			Federation Starship Essex.
			The Starship Essex vanished over
			two hundred years ago...
			Indeed. I know. I was there.
			This is my First Officer...
			Commander Steven Mullen.
			And my Security Chief...
			Lieutenant Morgan Kelly.
			You're telling me that you've
			survived this long as...
			Spirits? Ghosts? But you are
			a man who would never believe in
			ghosts, Picard. Isn't that true?
			You see, I know you. Troi knows
			you. And so I do, as well.
			Then Counselor Troi is still...
			alive?
			Yes, of course she is, and I have
			no wish to harm her. Or to harm
			anyone else.
			I'm pleased to hear that.
			We have been forced to take this
			action because we need your help,
			Captain.
			My help... ?
			Our consciousness has been trapped
			on this moon for two centuries...
			we must escape this torture...
			How did this happen to you?
			I cannot explain how it occurred,
			only that it did.
			The Essex was caught in an
			electromagnetic storm just as your
			shuttle was. Moments before we
			crashed, the bridge was struck
			by lightning. The ship was ripped
			apart. Somehow, in that instant,
			our consciousness was absorbed
			in the magnetic currents on the
			surface.
			Why didn't you tell us this? Why
			the deception, the violence?
			As I said, Captain. I knew you
			wouldn't believe us. Even now,
			I'm sure you do not.
			What was your vessel designation
			and complement?
			NCC One-seven-three... Daedalus
			class starship. Crew of two
			hundred twenty-nine.
			Under whose command in this
			sector?
			Admiral Uttan Narsu, Starbase
			Twelve. You will find all of this
			in Starfleet records...
			I do not need to see the records.
			Then you know I am correct.
			End this now and I will do
			whatever I can to help you...
			No. You do not trust me. And
			I cannot risk trusting you.
			It is taking too long. We
			sh-should have been there by
			now...
			He is manipulating you...
			Captain Picard has every right
			to be curious...
			He will try to delay until a
			rescue attempt is possible.
			I know that. But I also know that
			he will make every effort to
			protect the lives of his crew.
			Since our demands are not
			excessive, I hope you will see
			it is simpler to accede than to
			risk further injuries.
			What do you want?
			All you need to know for now,
			Captain, is that we want to rest.
			Simply, finally... to rest.
			... Section Two - B... A... Section
			One...
			Finally. I hope I never see
			this part of the Enterprise
			again...
			I hear you. This is what starship
			designers call "easy access"...
			This is it. I thought we might
			have a problem with conduit two-
			twenty-seven -- but it looks like
			we can get by it...
			We're through...
			Let's hook up the scanner and see
			what we've got...
			Got it...
			All three of them have to be in
			the circle if it's going to
			work...
			We're halfway home...
			La Forge to Crusher. How's it
			going?
			I think I've come up with an
			idea for a containment field.
			This anionic energy seems to
			be vulnerable to the same magnetic
			flux density we monitored in the
			storms. If I can duplicate
			that, we can trap it once it's
			out of our people.
			You ought to be able to do it
			by pumping Ten Forward full of
			ionogenic particles.
			Exactly what I was thinking...
			How long will it take to get it
			all ready?
			We still have to calibrate the
			plasma invertor, Commander... I'm
			guessing forty-five minutes to
			an hour...
			I'll have the containment field
			ready by then.
			Keep me advised.
			Impressions, Mister Worf?
			Spiritual possessions of this sort
			have been reported throughout
			Klingon history. It is called
			"Jat'yIn" -- the taking of the
			living by the dead.
			Yes, Human history is also full
			of similar legends.
			Then, you believe they may be
			telling the truth?
			Not for a moment.
			Sir, they seem to know much about
			the Essex... if it really is the
			spirit of Captain Shumar...
			... then he should be on much
			better behavior, don't you
			think... ? A Starfleet Captain?
			After living disembodied for two
			centuries, perhaps they have gone
			mad...
			Mister Worf, I assure you these
			are not Jat'yIn. Our job is to
			find out what they are... and 
			then to determine how to deal 
			with them...
			Stop speaking!
			I gave you that...
			In a place called McKinley Park.
			Green grass... tall trees.
			Please... don't...
			I hid the bracelet... in your
			pocket. You were... surprised.
			...please...
			You said, "You make me so happy,
			Miles."
			Get away from me.
			Get away.
			Leave her alone.
			Captain Shumar...
			We will reach the polar position
			you requested in minutes... I will
			need to give additional
			instructions...
			Very well. We are taking you to
			our crash site...
			At the southern pole... ?
			That is correct.
			Nothing our sensors were able to
			detect indicated that the Essex
			went down in the polar region...
			Well, it d-did.
			I told you, Captain... the ship
			broke apart in the atmosphere.
			The bridge went down here.
			When we reach it, you are going
			to beam what's left of our
			skeletal remains aboard this
			ship... and take them back to
			Earth for a proper burial.
			See how simple a request it is... ?
			Let these people go... and I
			will order the bridge to follow
			your instructions.
			No. No one will be released.
			If you are who you say you are,
			there is no need for any of
			this... we will gladly take you
			home.
			I wish you were truly so
			open-minded, Picard...
			If you do not release the
			hostages, I will not cooperate.
			You will cooperate... you will
			c-cooperate... or someone will
			die, Captain... who will it
			be... ?
			How about the Klingon?
			Get another one.
			You.
			No... please...
			Pick one to die, Captain. Or I
			will kill them both...
			Choose me, Captain.
			They're all in range. I need
			to do it now...
			I'm only gonna be able to shut
			down the forcefield for about
			seven seconds before the computer
			compensates...
			If they're the right seven
			seconds, it'll be enough...
			Bridge, stand by to release the
			ionogenic field on my signal...
			Standing by...
			Ready...
			Kill the forcefield!
			Forcefield down...
			Firing plasma charge...
			Damn... !
			Tell them to stop, or I'll kill
			everyone in this room! Starting
			with you.
			Picard to bridge. Abort
			immediately.
			As you say, Captain...
			Riker to La Forge, return to the
			bridge.
			Are you prepared to cooperate?
			Yes.
			First officer's log, supplemental.
			The Enterprise has moved into a
			synchronous orbit near the
			southern polar region. We await
			further instructions from Ten
			Forward.
			Any sign of the Essex?
			Negative, Commander. The
			electromagnetic disturbances
			are even worse here... scanners
			can't read a thing...
			Bridge to Ten Forward.
			Intense storm activity over the
			southern pole is making it
			virtually impossible for us to
			pick up any trace of the Essex...
			We're giving you the exact
			coordinates of our remains
			aboard the wreck of the Essex...
			I'm receiving the coordinates
			now...
			Geordi, can you tell what's there?
			Just your basic ionic cyclone.
			I can't read a thing.
			I'm sure as hell not going to just
			beam up whatever might be down
			there...
			I've got a good excuse for you.
			The transporters aren't going to
			work any better than the
			scanners...
			Bridge to Ten Forward... the same
			interference that is blocking our
			scanners would prevent us from
			using the transporters...
			They're lying...
			On the contrary, we've had a
			difficult time with transport
			since our arrival... that's why
			we had to send down the shuttle.
			You should all be well aware of
			that fact.
			We must be able to use the
			transporters...
			In fact, Chief O'Brien was the
			one who successfully executed the
			return of the away team... he is
			the most qualified on board to
			operate the transporter under
			these circumstances...
			Can you do it from here?
			No... I would have to use a
			transporter pad.
			I would be willing to grant you
			safe passage to the transporter
			pad in one of the cargo bays...
			It is a trick... he is trying to
			divide us...
			We must not be separated.
			I offer to grant you all safe
			passage.
			Why are you b-being so helpful
			suddenly?
			Because I assume if you go to the
			cargo bay, you will choose not
			to take all of the hostages.
			Their safety is my primary
			concern.
			What are the risks when we leave
			this room?
			Without the p-protection of the
			forcefield, we are vulnerable in
			a number of ways...
			They could use the transporter
			against us... Once the
			forcefield's down, they could
			beam us back to the surface.
			But there is a way to neutralize
			that threat...
			Bridge, transfer all transporter
			functions to Ten Forward...
			Ten Forward, in order to do that,
			you'll have to release your
			computer control lock-outs...
			That is not true...
			Let me speak to him.
			Number One, I think we have an
			opportunity to end this seige...
			But it will require cooperation
			from all concerned. Our guests
			will be moving shortly to cargo
			bay four, where the transport will
			occur. You are to ensure their
			safe passage from Ten Forward to
			the cargo bay.
			Understood, Captain.
			Mister La Forge, Doctor...
			Aye, sir...
			Transporter controls are being
			transferred...
			Ten Forward to bridge. I said all
			transporter controls. Including
			those aboard all your
			shuttlecraft.
			Almost had them, Ensign... nice
			try...
			Ten Forward. Our mistake.
			Remaining transporter functions
			are being transferred to you...
			By creating our own access code,
			we will be able to prevent anyone
			from using the transporter against
			us as we move to the cargo bay...
			What about their weapons?
			We will each take a hostage for
			protection... Captain Picard, you
			are mine.
			Please... let her stay...
			Lower the forcefield.
			Security teams, stand by.
			They're heading through section
			five...
			Mister La Forge, Doctor --
			they'll be at their destination
			in less than a minute...
			They've stopped at deck eighteen,
			sir...
			Security, allow them access into
			cargo bay four...
			I will require some assistance.
			Captain Shumar, may I ask a
			foolish question?
			You are not one to ask foolish
			questions, Picard...
			Nevertheless, I must ask how you
			intend to achieve your "rest"...
			when all is said and done...
			What do you mean?
			How do you intend to free yourself
			of this existence that has
			trapped your consciousness?
			It will fade as we move further
			from this planet...
			Really? What is your scientific
			basis for that?
			I don't need a scientific basis.
			Just be quiet.
			Perhaps you will be required to
			perform a noble deed before you
			can rest.
			What are you talking about?
			Surely you recall the old story
			of "The Canterville Ghost"...
			Do not insult me with foolish
			ghost stories, Picard...
			I would ask the same of you.
			When are you going to tell me
			who you really are?
			I have initialized the
			transporter signal...
			Proceed.
			They're powering up the
			transporter, Commander...
			Mister LaForge...
			I've isolated cargo bay four with
			a neutrino field, sir... But it
			won't take O'Brien and Data more
			than a couple of minutes to override
			it once they discover it's
			there...
			I hope that'll be enough time
			for the captain to play his
			hand...
			You know what he's going to do?
			There's only one reason he
			chose cargo bay four...
			If it becomes necessary, Ensign,
			you will blow the cargo bay hatch
			on my orders.
			Aye, sir.
			You're quite right, Picard.
			We're not ghosts. And it is not
			rest, we seek. Only escape.
			Escape?
			We were brought to this moon over
			five centuries ago from a star
			system called Ux-Mal... We were
			separated from our bodies and left
			to drift in the storms. Once
			we almost escaped... on board
			the Essex... but that ship was
			incapable of eluding the moon's
			electromagnetic currents...
			Did you really think using their
			identities would gain our
			sympathy... ?
			It was a better approach than
			asking you to allow hundreds of
			condemned prisoners on board...
			Then, this moon is a penal
			colony...
			That is correct. But now
			we have your ship... and your
			bodies to carry us home...
			I'm reading dozens of them...
			hundreds...
			They have the same anionic
			signature we saw on the biofilter
			scans...
			I think we can give the captain
			a new bargaining chip. Doctor
			Crusher, flood the cargo bay with
			your containment field...
			Let them go, or you will all die.
			Your threats are meaningless now.
			We are still in control of these
			three bodies. We will not leave
			them.
			Are you prepared to sacrifice the
			lives of the others? Because they
			will all die when the hatch to
			the cargo bay is blown...
			You will die too...
			I would die to save the life of
			my child.
			To die defending his ship is the
			hope of every Klingon.
			And if you each know the officers
			you inhabit, you know they are
			equally ready to give their lives
			for this ship.
			Free them now... And I will return
			you to the moon's surface.
			I advise you, Picard, not to pass
			our way again.
			Picard to bridge, our guests will
			be leaving shortly... I need an
			emergency medical team here...
			On our way, Captain.
			Mister Worf, transport these...
			prisoners... back to the moon's
			surface...
			Gladly, sir...
			It was almost as though my own
			consciousness were pushed to the
			side... I was watching it all
			happen... hearing my own voice...
			but I couldn't control any of
			it...
			What about the entity that
			controlled you... what were your
			perceptions of him?
			He was intelligent, actually.
			Thoughtful... in a ruthless
			sort of way. Cold.
			I must apologize for my
			inadvertant misconduct toward you,
			Lieutenant.
			There is no need to apologize.
			Your restraint was most remarkable
			for a Klingon.
			You have no idea.
			How do you feel?
			Hungry.
			Good sign.
			How do you feel?
			I'm just glad to have you back.
			If I could've killed that thing
			inside me... I would have...
			I know.
			We both know.
