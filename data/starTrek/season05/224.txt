			Time, Mister Data?
			We will be within transporter
			range in three minutes twenty-one
			seconds.
			I've finally established audio
			contact with the Romulan ship.
			... main power failing... no way
			to... any ship...
			Romulan ship, this is the
			Enterprise. We are en route to
			your position.
			... Enterprise... critical that
			you... core breach imminent...
			Repeat your last transmission.
			Sorry, Captain. They've stopped
			transmitting.
			Bridge to Commander Riker.
			Riker here.
			Number One... transport to the
			Romulan vessel as soon as we're
			in range.
			Aye, sir.
			No weapons. We don't want them
			to think they're under attack.
			This is not a bright idea.
			I beg your pardon, Ensign. I
			didn't quite catch that.
			Nothing, sir.
			We're from the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. We received your
			distress call.
			The Enterprise... ?
			That's right. Your message said
			you'd suffered a failure in your
			engine core.
			Yes.
			Commander?
			It's a pretty strange set-up, but
			I think the graviton field
			generator has completely
			depolarized. We can't fix it,
			it has to be replaced.
			Where are your replicators?
			They are off-line.
			Who's in charge here?
			The captain is dead. I'm... the
			science officer. Mirok.
			We'd like to take the generator
			back to the Enterprise for
			replication.
			All right.
			Geordi, you and Ro.
			La Forge to Brossmer. Two people,
			one piece of equipment to beam
			aboard.
			Aye, sir.
			What the hell...
			Engineering, I need more power
			to the primary energizing coil.
			Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm
			losing them -- I have to abort.
			They should be returning to your
			coordinates.
			Chief, they're not here. Do you
			have them?
			No, sir.
			Where are they?
			I can't locate their patterns.
			We've lost them, sir. They're
			gone.
			I'm sorry, Captain. But there's
			just nothing left to retrieve.
			Begin a level one diagnostic.
			All transporter systems to remain
			off-line until further notice.
			Could they have materialized
			somewhere else?
			Negative, Captain. Sensors are
			unable to find them within
			transporter range.
			Counselor?
			Riker to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			Captain, we're still looking at
			a core breach unless we can
			fashion a new graviton generator.
			I need...
			I need replacement personnel, sir.
			Mister Data, you may continue your
			diagnostic of the transporter
			system later. Take a shuttlecraft
			and two more engineers to the
			Romulan ship.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister McDowell, alert the main
			shuttlebay to have all available
			ships and pilots standing by in
			case we need them.
			Aye, sir.
			Lay in a course to take us away
			from the Romulan ship at Warp One
			in case it explodes.
			Pressure in the containment
			chamber has increased fifteen
			melakols in the last two minutes.
			What can we do to stop the
			overload?
			Most of the conduits were damaged
			in the explosion. I can't even
			access the central computer.
			Emergency bulkheads have sealed
			this section from the rest of the
			ship. There is no way to gain
			access to the bridge or other
			control centers.
			Survivors?
			Readings indicate at least
			seventy-three Romulans are still
			alive.
			Seventy-three...
			The pressure has jumped two
			hundred melakols!
			I've lost control of the
			containment chamber!
			It's going to implode...
			We'll have to dump the entire
			engine core. Do you have an
			auto-eject system?
			Yes, but it's not functioning.
			I'll have to do it manually.
			Worf, you two seal the chamber.
			Implosion will occur in one minute
			five seconds...
			Riker to Enterprise. We're
			preparing to jettison the engine
			core. We'll need you to extend
			shields once it clears the hull.
			Understood, Number One. We'll
			stand by for your signal.
			Commander!
			Time?
			Thirty seconds...
			Ready!
			Stay there! Eject the chamber
			on my order!
			Excuse me, sir.
			Now!
			Enterprise, extend shields!
			Well... we're still here.
			Yes.
			We'll have a complete power survey
			done within the hour... we'll
			probably have to supply them with
			energy for life support... and
			they're definitely going to need
			a new engine core to get home
			again.
			Understood, Commander. Keep us
			informed of your efforts. Picard
			out.
			I'll be in sickbay.
			Aye, sir.
			Ensign Ro to bridge.
			This is Ensign Ro, reporting in...
			I'm in section twenty-three baker,
			near sickbay.
			Sickbay...
			I need some help.
			Excuse me?
			The transporter could've beamed
			them somewhere else... the Romulan
			ship, another deck of the
			Enterprise...
			We've already checked those
			possibilities.
			The preliminary findings indicate
			there was a radiation surge from
			the Romulan engine core which
			disrupted the signal. They never
			rematerialized.
			We should check again, there might
			be something we overlooked and---
			We've done all we can, Beverly.
			You're right. I just... hate
			making out death certificates.
			Did Ensign Ro have any family?
			Captain, I'm right here.
			None that I know of, but I'll
			check with the Bajoran Liaison
			Office.
			I'm not dead!
			I'll have the official reports
			ready within the hour.
			Captain, I don't know what's going
			on --
			Doctor Crusher? Doctor?
			I'm right here...
			Dammnit, Doctor!
			We're ready, Commander.
			Riker to Enterprise. Begin power
			transfer.
			The power flow is consistent at
			four hundred Kolems... no
			fluctuations in frequency.
			The main power grid is on-line.
			Picard to Riker.
			Riker here. The power transfer
			appears stable at this end,
			Captain.
			Good. What is the status of their
			engine replacement?
			Engineering is modifying one of
			our subspace resonators to act
			as a new engine core. It won't
			do more than warp two, but it'll
			get them home.
			Very well.
			Captain...
			The diagnostic of the transporter
			system shows an anomalous energy
			fluctuation. I will need to
			inspect the imaging scanners in
			transporter room three.
			By all means.
			Captain --
			I have a personal favor to ask.
			I considered Commander La Forge
			to be my best friend. I feel it
			is my responsibility to plan and
			conduct the memorial service.
			May I have your permission to do
			so?
			Permission granted. Make
			whatever arrangements you find
			appropriate.
			Thank you, sir.
			Commander...
			Problem, Mister Worf?
			The Romulans want a computer.
			We cannot give them access to
			Federation technology. It is an
			unacceptable security risk.
			What about a computer from thirty
			or forty years ago... one the
			Romulans are already familiar
			with?
			That would be satisfactory.
			Check with the Enterprise to see
			what's available. But be sure
			your security concerns are
			addressed before we install it.
			Aye, sir.
			Thank you.
			La Forge...
			Ro -- boy, am I glad to see you...
			and I'm really glad you can see
			me.
			It's like I'm here, but... I'm
			not here.
			No one can see me either.
			I can't figure out what happened.
			One minute we were transporting
			from the Romulan ship... the next
			I just... woke up in the arboretum
			with a splitting headache.
			Can you... pass through things
			like bulkheads --
			Tables, people... yeah.
			Well... we're solid enough to each
			other.
			Not what you expected, is it?
			What do you mean?
			This. Death.
			What?
			We're dead, Geordi.
			Is that some kind of joke?
			Our patterns were lost in a
			transporter malfunction... we
			never rematerialized after leaving
			the Romulan ship.
			Wait a minute...
			What are you saying... that we're
			spirits?
			Spirits... souls... my people call
			them Borhyas. Whatever term you
			want to use -- we're it.
			My uniform... my VISOR... you're
			saying I'm a blind ghost with
			clothes?
			I don't have all the answers...
			I've never been dead before.
			We are not dead.
			According to Doctor Crusher, we
			died in a transporter malfunction
			at fourteen-thirty hours.
			I watched her make out the death
			certificates.
			We should make peace with our
			former lives, that's what I was
			taught... say goodbye to the
			people we're leaving behind --
			No. You may be ready for the
			afterlife, but I'm not.
			I don't see that we have much
			choice.
			When I was growing up, I never
			gave much thought to all the talk
			about Borhyas... I figured it was
			just superstition, passed on to
			children. But now...
			Fine. You go make peace with
			yourself. I'm going to
			transporter room three to find
			a way out of this... situation.
			I didn't have any warning that
			something would go wrong, sir.
			Suddenly... their patterns just
			weren't there.
			I believe the cause of the
			accident may be related to the
			explosion on the Romulan ship.
			Oh, yeah?
			But... that happened before we
			even arrived...
			In all likelihood the explosion
			damaged the Romulan cloaking
			device, causing it to discharge
			chroniton particles.
			I am detecting a chroniton field
			in here.
			A chroniton field...
			If the particles were produced
			on the Romulan ship, why are you
			detecting them here?
			The transporter beam --
			I suspect they travelled through
			the transporter beam. That may
			have been the cause of Geordi
			and Ro's death.
			I will go to the Romulan ship and
			see if I can discover the source
			of these emissions.
			Commander -- are these chronitons
			dangerous?
			They pose no danger to Humans --
			but some of the ship's systems
			may be affected by prolonged
			exposure. When I return I will
			devise a method to eradicate them.
			La Forge to Ensign Ro...
			Thanks for the ride.
			I'm here to say goodbye.
			There are a lot of what appear
			to be experimental engine
			components lying around over
			there. I'd say they were testing
			some new warp drive design and
			it blew up in their faces.
			That would explain why they're
			this far away from Romulan
			space... to avoid being picked
			up on Federation long-range
			scanners.
			We should have an engine core
			ready for them by nineteen hundred
			hours.
			Commander... there will be a
			memorial service at twenty-three
			hundred hours this evening.
			Mister Data is making the
			arrangements.
			I'll be there.
			Me, too.
			In fact... I might like to say
			a few words.
			You knew La Forge longer than
			any of us.
			Actually, I was thinking more
			of Ensign Ro...
			Me?
			Coordinate with Mister Data.
			Wait a minute... what are you
			going to say about me?
			Captain...
			I don't believe this... I'm
			dead... you can't hear me... and
			I'm still intimidated by you.
			I just wanted to say... thank you.
			For trusting me when no one else
			would.
			There you are.
			Excuse me, Captain.
			Data is taking the next shuttle
			back to the Romulan ship and we've
			got to be on it.
			Why?
			I think we'll find the answer to
			what's happened to us over there.
			Why can't you just accept---
			Look, if you're right and we're
			dead this won't make any
			difference. But if I'm right,
			then we're still alive... and I'm
			going to need your help.
			Lieutenant, I am planning a
			memorial service for Commander
			La Forge and Ensign Ro. I would
			like you to participate.
			What kind of service?
			Captain Picard asked me to arrange
			a ceremony that is appropriate.
			I have given a great deal of
			thought as to what is
			"appropriate" in this instance.
			Sir, shuttlecraft four has not
			cleared the Romulan ship yet.
			Hold position here.
			This is a little weird...
			listening to them plan our
			funeral...
			I find that I am having difficulty
			deciding what kind of service to
			have. Do you have any
			suggestions?
			Human custom is to conduct a
			solemn, dignified service in which
			the dead are praised by their
			friends and loved ones.
			Ensign Ro was Bajoran. Her
			beliefs should be reflected as
			well. But their death rituals
			are quite complicated.
			Please... not the Death Chant...
			The Bajorn Death Chant is over
			two hours long...
			I am not certain that either Human
			or Bajoran rites are fitting...
			and I have researched the
			funerary customs of over five
			thousand cultures to no avail...
			Shuttlecraft four has cleared...
			Resume course.
			In almost all societies it is
			traditional to say a ritual
			farewell to those you call
			friends.
			I did not know what a friend was
			until I met Geordi. He spoke to
			me as though I were Human... he
			treated me no differently from
			anyone else. He accepted me for
			what I am. And that, I have
			learned, is friendship. I would
			like this service to reflect that
			friendship.
			But I do not know how to say
			goodbye.
			Sounds almost Human, doesn't he?
			Commander, I am not the proper
			person to advise you.
			Why not?
			I am very happy for Commander La
			Forge. He has crossed to... that
			which is beyond. For a Klingon,
			this is a joyful time... a friend
			has died in the line of duty...
			and he has earned a place among
			the honored dead. It is not a
			time to mourn.
			Begin docking procedure.
			Data -- I appreciate the
			sentiment. But you're a little
			premature. I don't intend to get
			commemorated before my time.
			I'm afraid I fail to see the point
			of this investigation, Commander.
			Chroniton emissions may have been
			responsible for the accident which
			claimed the lives of our officers.
			A most regrettable event, of
			course...
			Was your cloaking device damaged
			in the explosion?
			All our systems were damaged.
			Including the cloaking device.
			Then that explains the chroniton
			fields I am detecting here.
			For your own safety, it is
			important to eliminate the
			emissions.
			Our safety?
			There is no way to predict what
			might happen when the chronitons
			interact with the new engine core.
			I've never seen anything like
			this. There's something in there
			that looks like a molecular phase
			inverter...
			What's that?
			It's supposed to change the
			structure of matter so it can...
			pass through "normal" matter and
			energy... hey, wait a minute...
			A few years back, we got
			intelligence reports that the
			Klingons were working on combining
			a phase inverter and a cloaking
			device. In theory, they believed
			that a... phased ship could hide
			anywhere... even inside a planet.
			And conventional weapons would
			be useless against it.
			How far did they get in their
			research?
			It never got out of the
			preliminary stages... there were
			several accidents. The Romulans
			might be pursuing the same
			technology -- trying to combine
			an inverter and a cloaking device.
			If this is the prototype...
			Then that would explain the
			explosion... the chroniton
			fields...
			And us.
			You mean we're -- cloaked?
			Not just cloaked -- phased...
			our molecular structure altered
			so we have no substance.
			That means we're not dead.
			It also means -- there might be
			a way we can decloak.
			The field emissions are
			particularly strong here.
			You can be assured that the
			emissions will be eliminated
			before the engine core is
			replaced.
			Commander, may I speak with you?
			When they come back... they're
			going to discover the interphase
			generator.
			Is their power transfer beam still
			at full intensity?
			Yes. It will be until we are
			ready to switch to internal power.
			We will set up a muon feedback
			wave inside the transfer beam.
			The particles will accumulate in
			their dilithium chamber. When
			they go to warp speed, their
			engines will explode.
			We have to get back to the
			Enterprise and warn them.
			How?
			I don't know, but we have to find
			a way. Come on.
			The muon feedback wave's not
			showing up on any of the engine
			displays.
			The Romulans must be hiding it
			in the sensor return signal.
			Unless someone runs a level three
			diagnostic, they'll never see it.
			There has to be a way to warn them
			before the ship goes to warp.
			This is puzzling. Three more
			chroniton fields have formed
			aboard the Enterprise in the last
			hour.
			There's no reason why the
			interphase device would be
			producing new fields aboard this
			ship.
			We should begin decontamination
			immediately. Run an internal
			sensor sweep for the locations
			of all chroniton fields on the
			Enterprise.
			The following areas are showing
			contamination: Sickbay,
			transporter room three, main
			bridge, captain's ready room,
			shuttlebay two, and main
			engineering.
			Ro, listen to that...
			I do not understand how these new
			fields have formed. No
			transporter beam has been active
			in any of those areas. And I do
			not see that they have anything
			in common...
			Oh, yes they do...
			They seem to be appearing at
			random.
			No, they're not.
			We were in every one of those
			locations. Somehow we're
			leaving... chroniton footprints
			behind us.
			Can you narrow the focus of the
			scan to pinpoint the locations?
			Not with the internal sensors,
			Commander.
			Go to science station two on the
			bridge and use the lateral sensor
			array to get a more precise
			reading. I will modify an anyon
			emitter to eliminate the fields
			once they have been isolated.
			You go with her and see what the
			lateral sensors turn up. I'll
			stay here with Data.
			Right.
			That's interesting... you're
			picking up chroniton readings in
			here, but not from me.
			There's a field in this wall?
			Why?
			Data, I came through this wall.
			I walked right through it when
			I came in here...
			When the phased matter in my body
			passed through the wall, it
			must've distrupted the wall's
			molecular structure... producing
			a chroniton field.
			Data, I'm right here... that's
			me you're reading...
			Come on... it's me...
			Do not move.
			Yes, I can see you.
			Who are you?
			Where is the scientific officer?
			The other one like us... the one
			who came with you to our ship.
			He spoke of a plan to return to
			normal.
			Yes, this disruptor works. I was
			wearing it when I was... changed.
			Now, where is he?
			Stop being so rational... use your
			imagination for a change... these
			aren't just random patterns...
			it's me!
			Hey, watch where you point that
			thing.
			Wait a minute, Data... you did
			something to me...
			It's not so easy to push through
			any more...
			That means the molecules in my
			hand must have been partially
			dephased by the anyon beam...
			Data, if the low-level beam
			brought my hand part of the way
			back... maybe a high-level beam
			would bring me all the way back.
			I've got to get you to turn up
			the beam intensity so that...
			Hey, don't stop now.
			No, no, no. Don't give up on
			it... it works, I was just
			creating more fields. Your
			method is fine... just turn up
			the intensity...
			He's in here.
			Brossmer to Commander Data. I've
			just detected a large chroniton
			field on deck seventeen. The
			field strength is three hundred
			percent above the others we've
			found.
			Is that Ro... ?
			Acknowledged.
			... heart-rate one hundred six...
			blood pressure one hundred forty
			over ninety... you have completed
			twelve sets of ten repetitions,
			beginning set thirteen... heart-rate
			one hundred eight...
			Get up.
			Where is the science officer?
			RO!
			Excuse me for interrupting,
			Lieutenant. I have detected a
			chroniton field in this room.
			May I scan the area for a moment?
			Thanks.
			Any time.
			Your room is heavily contaminated
			with chronitons. This will only
			take a moment.
			There's still no indication that
			the Romulans set up a muon wave
			in our dilithium chamber.
			It's there -- and when they go to
			warp...
			Incoming message from the Romulan
			ship, Captain.
			On screen.
			Now what?
			We have tested the engine core
			and are ready to switch to
			internal power, Enterprise.
			Understood.
			Disconnect the power transfer
			beam.
			We are now on internal power.
			Captain Picard, Commander Riker,
			please accept my sincere thanks
			on behalf the Romulan Empire.
			Don't listen to him, Captain --
			It was our pleasure, Mirok. I
			hope that this example of
			cooperation between our two people
			is not an isolated incident.
			As do I, Captain.
			Set a course for the Garadius
			system.
			Warp six...
			No, Captain -- wait --
			Don't do it, sir --
			Captain.
			I'm still running the
			decontamination program. Mister
			Data believes we shouldn't engage
			the warp drive until I've cleared
			all the chroniton fields from the
			ship.
			Very well. Let me know when your
			sweep is finished.
			Yes, sir.
			If we go to the locations where
			she's decontaminating... maybe
			the anyon emissions will rephase
			us enough for someone to see us.
			The beam strength would have to
			be pretty strong for us to become
			visible for more than a
			millisecond. Someone would have
			to be looking right at us.
			Then we better go someplace with
			a lot of people.
			Captain... it's time. We'd better
			go.
			Mister McDowell, you have the
			bridge. I'll be... at the service
			in Ten Forward.
			Ten Forward. That's perfect.
			We'll create as many chroniton
			fields in there as we can... get
			them to flood the room with a
			stronger beam.
			Deck Ten.
			I've been thinking about the first
			time I met Geordi La Forge. He
			was a young officer assigned to
			pilot me on an inspection tour...
			I made some off-hand remark about
			the shuttle's engine efficiency
			not being what it should... the
			next morning I found he'd stayed
			up all night refitting the fusion
			initiators.
			I knew right then that I wanted
			him with me on my next command.
			Have you decided what you're going
			to say about Ensign Ro?
			Yeah, I have. It wasn't easy...
			What? What wasn't easy?
			What?
			What's going on here?
			It's our memorial service.
			This?
			Why not?
			I can't believe this... they think
			we're dead... and they're having
			a party...
			Yeah. It's perfect.
			Come on... let's get started.
			Well. This is... unusual.
			Yeah... but I think I like it.
			Now I suppose I'll never know what
			you were going to say about me.
			But... do you think the others
			will think this service is --
			appropriate?
			Look around you, Data. People
			are sharing memories of Geordi
			and Ro... talking, laughing...
			I don't know what could be more
			appropriate.
			I am glad you approve, Doctor.
			Brossmer to Commander Data.
			Go ahead, Chief.
			Sir, we've cleared the critical
			areas of chronitons... but we've
			detected a new field forming in
			Ten Forward that is stronger than
			any we've seen before. Should
			I wait until the service is over
			before beginning decontamination?
			No. Anyonic emissions are
			harmless. Please begin
			immediately.
			Here we go...
			Worf! Worf, can you see me?
			We have to find a way to increase
			the emission strength.
			... if she hadn't lost her rank
			following the incident at Garon
			Four, I think she would've made
			lieutenant commander by now.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			Incoming message from Garadius
			Four, sir. The diplomatic
			situation is deteriorating. They
			want an update on our ETA.
			Stand by, Ensign.
			We've got to do something now,
			before they go to warp.
			The disruptor... I can set it on
			overload.
			Do it.
			Excuse me, Mister Data.
			Let's go!
			I'd like to get under way as
			soon as possible. The situation
			on Garadius Four is becoming
			serious.
			I see no reason to delay our
			departure, Captain. The chroniton
			fields have been cleared from all
			critical areas.
			Excellent.
			Mister McDowell, set course for
			Gardius Four and engage at---
			Commander Data, chroniton field
			strength in Ten Forward has just
			increased by three thousand
			percent.
			Curious.
			I believe it would be best if we
			decontaminate this room before
			getting underway, sir.
			Very well.
			Chief Brossmer, increase anyonic
			emissions to six thousand
			particles per second and
			decontaminate the area.
			Aye, sir.
			Hang on.
			Data, we're here! Can you see
			us?
			Did you see that?
			Yes, sir.
			Yes.
			Come on, Data... put it together
			now...
			It wasn't ghosts, Mister Data...
			what did we see?
			Captain, I may know what has
			happened...
			Please be right, Data...
			... it would explain the mysterious
			chroniton fields...
			Yes, yes, yes...
			... if they were cloaked in some
			way...
			Are you saying you think they're
			still alive?
			If I am right, they are -- and
			in this room. Their brief
			appearance coincided with the
			anyonic sweep. Perhaps the anyons
			neutralize the cloaking effect.
			Data to Chief Brossmer. Set the
			anoynic beam to its highest level
			and flood Ten Forward.
			Aye, sir.
			Data -- Can you see me?
			Of course.
			La Forge to engineering. Take
			the warp engines off-line until
			further notice.
			There's a muon wave build-up in
			the dilithium chamber.
			Who gave that order?
			That was Commander Geordi La
			Forge, Ensign. Please follow his
			instructions.
			Aye, sir.
			Looks like a great party. Mind
			if we join you?
			Could you pass the rolls?
			You've been eating for an hour...
			We didn't have anything to eat
			for almost two days. I'm starved.
			What's wrong?
			Nothing...
			I was raised with Bajoran
			beliefs... and I even followed
			some of the practices, but...
			I never really believed in life
			after death. Then suddenly I was
			dead and there was another life.
			It made me feel like I'd been...
			pretty arrogant to discount all
			I'd been taught. Now... I don't
			know what to believe...
			Maybe we should develop our own
			interphase device...
			... if it can teach Ro Laren
			humility, it can do anything.
			You know... I think I am hungry
			after all.
