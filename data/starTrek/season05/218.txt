			How'd you know I was bluffing?
			I just had a feeling.
			I guess it's better to be lucky

			Or maybe it's the way your left

			bluff.
			Just teasing, Commander.
			Ogawa to Doctor Crusher.
			Go ahead.
			Commander La Forge needs you in

			On my way.
			At first I thought the catwalk

			me.
			I'm lucky Ensign Fletcher was
			there to grab me -- it's a long
			way down to the bottom of the warp
			core.
			You have all the symptoms of an
			inner-ear infection. That
			would explain your dizziness...
			and the headache.
			But I don't see any physical
			evidence.
			My guess is... you've been working
			too hard.
			I have been putting in extra hours
			on the Typhon Expanse survey.
			I'll give you twenty cc's of
			vertazine -- it'll clear up your
			dizziness. But finding time to
			relax is up to you...
			What is it?
			Geordi... have you ever had these
			symptoms before?
			Never.
			You're sure?
			Positive. Why?
			It's funny... I get the feeling
			that we've discussed these
			complaints.
			I remember giving you a hypospray
			for dizziness.
			I've never had these symptoms
			before today. You must be
			remembering some other patient.
			No. I'm sure it was you.
			Try to get some rest. And stay
			away from high places for a few
			days, just in case.
			Thanks, Doc.
			Goodnight.
			The Typhon Expanse is huge. If
			we want to chart the most remote
			star system, we'll have to launch
			a probe within the next few hours.
			Fine.
			What about the luminosity studies?
			They may pose a problem...
			How so?
			The flux spectrometers are still
			down for realignment.
			I thought they were supposed to
			be back on-line yesterday.
			They were, until the stellar
			dynamics lab decided they needed
			to install new modules.
			I recommend we use the gravitron
			polarimeter instead. It will
			perform a similar function.
			Make it so.
			Captain... There's something I'd
			like to report.
			Yes, Doctor?
			I heard... voices in my room last
			night. I was alone... so at first
			I thought I was imagining things.
			But this morning, ten other people
			reported hearing them at the same
			time I did.
			What were the voices saying?
			I couldn't make them out...
			Data, did the sensors pick up
			anything unusual last night?
			No anomalous readings were
			reported.
			When we're through here,
			double-check the sensor logs.
			Aye sir.
			Counselor?
			I sensed nothing out of the
			ordinary last night.
			Maybe it's a problem with the com
			system.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			We are getting unusual readings
			-- twenty thousand kilometers off
			the port bow.
			Report.
			Sensors didn't detect the
			phenomenon until we were almost
			on top of it, sir.
			It is a highly localized
			distortion in the space-time
			continuum.
			On screen.
			Back us off, Ensign. Nice and
			slow.
			Aye sir.
			Captain -- maneuvering thrusters
			are not responding.
			The distortion field is
			fluctuating.
			All main systems just went down.
			Power levels dropping rapidly...
			Red Alert.
			There is an energy build-up in

			Something is emerging...
			Captain -- we have to get out of
			here now.
			Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
			Shields inoperative!
			The helm's not responding!
			The vessel is on a collision

			seconds...
			Hail them.
			No response.
			Suggestions?
			Decompress the main shuttlebay
			-- the explosive reaction might
			kick us out of the way.
			Captain -- I recommend we use the
			tractor beam to alter the other

			No, I don't.
			We've had this discussion. I
			remember giving you this
			examination...
			Let's check the medical logs.
			You've been treated several times
			for headaches related to your
			VISOR... but I see no mention
			of dizziness.
			Must be deja-vu.
			Both of us -- about the same
			thing?
			Crusher to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Doctor?
			Jean-Luc... do you have a minute?
			My Aunt Adele cured a lot of
			sleepless nights with this steamed
			milk.
			Thank you.
			Mmm... nutmeg.
			Every time I get insomnia, I try
			to perfect the recipe.
			It was the eeriest feeling. When
			the glass broke, it triggered the
			same sensation even more intensely
			-- that I had done it all before.
			Earlier, when I was reading this
			book... I had the distinct
			feeling I'd read certain
			paragraphs before.
			I just assumed I'd read the book
			years ago and forgotten.
			I've been having this feeling
			for hours.
			And then those voices...
			Do you feel like we've had this
			conversation before?
			No. None of this seems familiar.
			This could be nothing more than
			a restless night. But let's be
			sure... Call Geordi and Data.
			I want you to run a shipwide
			diagnostic, concentrating on the
			time and place you heard the
			voices.
			We'll discuss the results tomorrow
			at oh seven hundred hours.
			Thank you, Jean-Luc.
			For everything.
			Thank Aunt Adele.
			The internal scans were negative.
			There was no evidence of auditory
			anomalies anywhere on the ship.
			As far as the sensors are
			concerned, nothing unusual
			happened last night.
			Before I came up here, ten other
			people reported hearing voices
			at the same time I did.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.

			Yeah -- last Tuesday night.
			That is not what I mean.
			I've been feeling the same way...

			An eight. An Ace...
			A Queen. I'm going to get a

			And you're going to get a four...

			But nobody has bet.
			Forget the bet. Deal.
			Ten... Seven... Queen...
			Nine... Jack... Four...
			Deuce... Six...
			This is highly improbable.
			How did we know...
			Wait.
			Crusher to sickbay.
			Sickbay here.
			Is Commander La Forge there?
			No, Doctor, he's not.
			Wait a minute -- he just came in.
			You wanted to see me, Doctor?
			Yes...
			Captain... have you been getting
			the feeling that you've
			experienced certain things before?
			A sense of... repetition?
			Yes... recently. While I was
			reading. Why do you ask?
			There have been similar incidents
			reported all over the ship.
			Feelings of deja-vu.
			And now this...
			I had a premonition Geordi was
			going to come in to sickbay. A
			few seconds later, he did -- with
			the symptoms of an ear infection.
			I was going to run all the
			standard tests... but somehow I
			knew they were going to be
			negative. So I ran an optical
			diagnostic... which traced the
			problem to Geordi's VISOR...
			His dizziness is being caused by
			a phase-shift in his visual
			receptors. It's causing him to
			see images that aren't there...
			They're like... blurry
			afterimages.
			I ran a scan to see if I could
			detect what he was seeing. I
			picked up miniscule distortions
			in the surrounding dekyon
			field.
			Somehow, his VISOR seems to be
			translating those distortions
			into visual impulses.
			It could be a malfunction in the
			ship's warp field generator. I'll
			check it out.
			While you're at it, run a
			localized subspace scan to look
			for anything unusual.
			Aye, sir.
			Keep me advised.
			Crusher to Commander La Forge.
			La Forge here.
			I just heard what sounded like...
			voices in my room. But there's
			no one here.
			Sensors just picked up something
			strange, too. We're checking it
			out...
			I'm on my way down.
			Looks like you managed to record
			six point two seconds worth.
			Let's see if we can filter the
			signal and clear it up a little.
			So I wasn't just hearing things?
			The sound itself appears to have
			been real. However the acoustic
			energy does not correspond to
			any ship's system, nor to any
			voice communications sent at the
			time you heard it.
			Then where did the sound come
			from?
			You heard the voices at the same
			time our localized subspace scan
			picked up a another dekyon field
			distortion. The two may be related.
			Let's take another listen...
			Computer -- perform a narrow
			bandwidth analysis. Eliminate
			all nonvocal waveform components.
			Can we isolate the voices... find
			out what they're saying?
			I will attempt to distinguish the
			individual voices.
			Computer -- continuous playback.
			There seem to be approximately
			one thousand human voices
			overlapping.
			The voices are those of the
			Enterprise crew.
			Our voices.
			I'm sorry to call you here so
			early. But we couldn't wait until
			oh seven hundred hours.
			We think we may have an
			explanation for the odd
			occurrences around here...
			This is going to sound pretty
			wild...
			Somehow, we've entered what seems
			to be a temporal causality loop.
			We think we're stuck in a
			particular fragment of time. And
			we've been experiencing that same
			fragment over and over again.
			Is this what's causing our
			deja-vu?
			Yes, but it's more than that.
			In deja-vu, you only think you're
			repeating events. We actually
			are.
			Our theory is this -- every time
			the loop begins again, everything
			resets itself, and starts all
			over. We don't remember anything
			that happened before... so each
			time through the loop, we think
			it's the first.
			You mean, maybe we've come into
			this room, sat at this table and
			had this conversation a dozen
			times already?
			A dozen... a hundred... It's
			impossible to tell. Maybe we've
			been trapped here for hours...
			days... maybe years.
			If what we're saying is true --
			those voices I heard might've
			been "echoes" from previous loops.
			The same thing with the
			phase-shift in my VISOR --
			afterimages in time.
			If you are correct... how did it
			happen? How did we get here?
			I have a hypothesis which may
			explain that, Captain.
			I have analyzed the recording
			Doctor Crusher made.
			Most of it is quite ordinary.
			One hundred twenty-five
			discussions about ship operations,
			two hundred fifty-seven
			conversations of a personal
			nature, five couples engaged in
			romantic encounters...
			Your point, Mister Data?
			There is evidence of some sort
			of disaster involving the
			Enterprise -- severe enough that
			the captain would order all hands
			to abandon ship. I have isolated
			three segments of the recording
			which are crucial.
			... a highly localized
			distortion...
			... collision course. Impact in
			thirty-six seconds...
			... hands abandon ship. Repeat,
			all hands abandon...
			The phrase "collision course"
			suggests we collided with
			something.
			Worf refers to a "distortion."
			If this were a temporal
			distortion, and if we were close
			enough to it... it's possible
			that a large enough explosion
			might've ruptured the space-time
			continuum.
			We collided... exploded... and
			got stuck in this repeating loop
			of time.
			If you're right about this...
			perhaps we could escape the loop
			by avoiding the collision...
			That's our guess.
			Maybe we should reverse course.
			For all we know, reversing course
			might be what leads us into the
			crash.
			We can't afford to start
			second-guessing ourselves. We'll
			stay on our present course until
			we have reason to change it.
			In the meantime, let's do
			everything we can to avoid a
			collision.
			Captain... We may not find out
			how to avoid this accident until
			it's too late. And if the loop
			begins again -- we'll forget
			everything we've learned this time
			around.
			What do you suggest?
			If we do find a way to avoid the
			collision... we should try to
			send that information into the
			next loop.
			Is that possible?
			We have seen that echoes, or
			afterimages, from previous loops
			appear as distortions in the
			dekyon field. We may be able to
			send a deliberate echo into the
			next loop.
			Like a message in a bottle...
			Exactly. We could enhance a
			dekyon emission to create a
			specific pattern... and send
			ourselves a message. Not a long
			one -- probably only a few
			characters... maybe one word...
			How do we know we'll pick up that
			word the next time through?
			If the dekyon emission is
			modulated correctly, it would set
			up a resonance in my positronic
			subprocessors. I would receive
			the information -- on what you
			would call a subconscious level.
			That's the catch. We're not sure
			how the information will be
			perceived by Data... it might
			be almost like a posthypnotic
			suggestion.
			Even with all these uncertainties,
			we've got to try.
			Take whatever steps are
			necessary to send a message.
			Dismissed.
			It's possible we've tried this
			a thousand times and it's never
			worked.
			Do you have the feeling you've
			done it before?
			No, I don't.
			Neither do I. Maybe that's a good
			sign.
			Let's test the emitter.
			Particle accelerators to full
			power.
			Dekyon field active... particle
			flux nominal...
			We're in business.
			All we need now is a message.
			Senior staff report to the bridge.
			On our way.
			How do you think we might've
			handled this before?

			You have all the symptoms of an

			explain your dizziness... and the
			headache.
			But I don't see any physical...
			What is it?
			Geordi... have you ever had these

			Now that you mention it... I think
			I did.
			Do you recall when?
			No, I don't.
			We've had this discussion. I
			remember giving you this

			Let's check the medical logs.
			You've been treated several times
			for headaches related to your
			VISOR... but I see no mention
			of dizziness.
			Must be deja-vu.
			Both of us -- about the same
			thing?
			Let's run an optical diagnostic.
			For an ear infection?
			I've got a hunch...
			Hold still... this pulse may be
			a little bright...
			That's odd...
			Have you made any changes to your
			VISOR lately?
			No. Why?
			I'm detecting a slight phase-shift
			in your visual receptors...
			Crusher to Captain Picard.
			Yes, Doctor?
			Can you come to sickbay
			immediately? It's urgent.
			On my way.
			His dizziness is being caused by
			a phase-shift in his visual
			receptors. It's causing him to
			see images that aren't there...

			Aye, sir.
			Keep me advised.
			Lateral sensors on-line --
			subspace scanners active...
			Data, will you run a level two
			diagnostic on the warp subsystems?
			Certainly.
			All three's... that can't be
			right.
			I have encountered the numeral
			"three" an inordinate number of
			times over the last two hours.
			We've got a dekyon field
			fluctuation on deck nine, section
			twenty-eight...
			Crusher to Commander La Forge.
			La Forge here.
			I just heard what sounded like...
			voices in my room. But there's
			no one here.
			Sensors just picked up something
			strange, too. We're checking it
			out...
			I'm on my way down.
			Are you alright, Doctor?
			I'm fine.
			... a highly localized
			distortion...
			... collision course. Impact in
			thirty-six seconds...
			... hands abandon ship. Repeat,
			all hands abandon...
			The phrase "collision course"
			suggests we collided with
			something.
			Worf refers to a "distortion."
			If this were a temporal
			distortion, and if we were close
			enough to it... it's possible that
			a large enough explosion might've
			ruptured the space-time continuum.
			We collided... exploded... and
			got stuck in this repeating loop
			of time.
			If you're right about this...
			Perhaps we could escape the loop
			by avoiding the collision.
			That's our guess.
			Maybe we should reverse course.
			For all we know, reversing course
			might be what leads us into the
			crash.
			We can't afford to start
			second-guessing ourselves. We'll
			stay on our present course until
			we have reason to change it.
			In the meantime, let's do
			everything we can to avoid a
			collision.
			Captain... We've been seeing the
			number three all over the ship.
			On consoles... in a poker game...
			In total, we have encountered two
			thousand eighty-five conspicuous
			examples of the number "three."
			All these "threes" can't be coming
			up by accident.
			Maybe somebody's trying to tell
			us something.
			We came to the same conclusion...
			so we ran a shipwide diagnostic
			-- the only unusual thing we found
			was a dekyon field modulation in
			Data's positronic subprocessors.
			What could be causing it?
			I don't know. But if I wanted
			to send information from one loop
			to the next... I might have used
			a method like a dekyon emission.
			You think we sent ourselves a
			message?
			It would make sense. Maybe we
			were trying to tell ourselves
			something...
			If that were true... what could
			"three" indicate?
			Maybe we should run a level three
			diagnostic on all key systems.
			Good idea. And I'll have the
			computer run a pattern-matching
			algorithm based on the number
			three.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			We are getting unusual readings
			-- twenty thousand kilometers off
			the port bow.
			Red Alert.
			Report.
			Sensors didn't detect the
			phenomenon until we were almost
			on top of it, sir.
			It is a highly localized
			distortion in the space-time
			continuum.
			On screen.
			How do you think we might've
			handled this before?
			Back us off, Ensign. Nice and
			slow.
			Aye sir.
			Captain -- maneuvering thrusters
			are not responding.
			The distortion field is
			fluctuating.
			All main systems just went down.
			Power levels dropping rapidly...
			There is an energy build-up in
			the distortion field.
			Something is emerging...
			Captain -- we have to get out of
			here now.
			Shields up! Evasive maneuvers!
			Shields inoperative!
			The helm's not responding!
			The vessel is on a collision
			course. Impact in thirty-six
			seconds...
			Hail them.
			No response.
			Suggestions?
			Decompress the main shuttlebay
			-- the explosive reaction might
			kick us out of the way.
			Captain -- I recommend we use the
			tractor beam to alter the other
			ship's trajectory.
			Mister Worf -- make it so.
			Engaging tractor beam...
			The tractor beam will not be
			successful. I am decompressing
			the main shuttlebay...
			We are clear of the distortion,
			Captain.
			Data -- what happened?
			At the last moment, I speculated
			that "three" might refer to the
			number of rank insignia on
			Commander Riker's uniform.
			This indicated to me that his
			suggestion was the correct course
			of action.
			You must've picked up a message
			we sent from the last loop...
			and stacked the deck in the poker
			game without realizing it.
			That is possible, Commander. I
			may also have been inadvertently
			responsible for the unexplained
			appearances of the number
			"three."
			Mister Worf, end Red Alert. See
			if you can access a Federation
			time-base beacon. Find out how
			long we've been in this causality
			loop.
			Aye, sir.
			Time-base confirms that our
			chronometers are off by seventeen
			point four days.
			Reset them, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain -- we are being hailed
			by the other vessel.
			The computer identifies it as the
			U.S.S. Bozeman. A Federation
			starship, Soyuz class.
			Soyuz Class... they haven't been
			in service for over eighty years.
			Open a channel.
			This is Captain Morgan Bateson of
			the Federation Starship Bozeman.
			Can we render assistance?
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise.
			We were just going to ask you the
			same thing.
			Captain Picard... your ship is
			unfamiliar to us.
			Have you any idea what just
			happened?
			Our sensors detected a temporal
			distortion. Then your ship
			appeared... we nearly hit you.
			The Enterprise has been caught
			in temporal causality loop. And
			I suspect something similar
			happened to you.
			You must be mistaken. We only
			left starbase three weeks ago.
			Captain Bateson... do you know
			what year it is?
			Of course I do -- it's twenty-two
			seventy-eight.
			Captain... perhaps you should beam
			aboard our ship.
			There's something we need to
			discuss.
