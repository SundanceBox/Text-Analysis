			Captain's log, stardate 45400.3.
			Two days ago, Starbase
			Five-one-four lost contact with
			the research vessel Vico, which
			was sent to explore the interior
			of a Black Cluster. We are
			en route to investigate.
			Captain, we are entering sector
			nine-seven.
			Sir, I am picking up massive
			gravitational fluctuations...
			Take us out of warp, Ensign.
			Yes, sir.
			The Black Cluster is in visual
			range.
			On screen.
			Aye, Captain.
			Let's find that ship. Full sensor
			sweep, Mister Data.
			Yes, Commander.
			It's quite a sight.
			One of the most ancient formations
			in the galaxy.
			I have located the Vico. The
			vessel appears to be adrift.
			Let's see it.
			Life signs?
			Nothing, Commander.
			Damage report, Mister Data.
			The outer and inner hulls have
			been breached. Decks seven
			through twelve are exposed to
			space.
			Set up a translink to their
			computer core. Let's see what
			happened.
			I cannot, sir. The emergency
			bulkheads on that deck are in
			place. Our linkup signal cannot
			penetrate them.
			Structural status, Commander.
			Stress readings indicate
			considerable pressure on the
			transverse supports.
			Is it stable enough for an away
			team?
			Yes, sir. But the risk of
			structural collapse is high.
			Have transporter room one maintain
			a lock on each member of your
			away team.
			I want you out of there at the
			first sign of trouble.
			Aye, Captain.
			Ensign, take us to fifteen
			thousand meters.
			Yes, sir.
			Data, you're with me.
			This station is inoperable.
			This one's stuck in a feedback
			loop.
			Let's try to tap directly into
			the computer core.
			There should be an ODN junction
			along here somewhere...
			This looks like a good
			possibility...
			Careful, Geordi. You don't want
			to pull out the wrong brick...
			Data.
			Core transfer is engaged.
			Exchange protocol verified.
			The files seem to be intact. Some
			of them, anyway.
			Is somebody there... ?
			Stay here.
			Data.
			Are my parents alright?
			Captain's log, supplemental. A
			young boy, shielded from our
			initial sensor scans, has been
			discovered alive by the away team.
			The degree of damage to the Vico
			is making our rescue attempt
			difficult...
			Transporter room one, can you lock
			onto him?
			And transport directly to
			sickbay?
			I'll try, Captain...
			But there's a lot of shielding
			to pull him through.
			Acknowledged.
			Picard to Crusher.
			Sickbay here, Captain.
			Standby for emergency transport.
			Aye, sir. Crusher out.
			Picard to Commander Riker.
			Is the boy ready, Number One?
			Everything's gonna be okay...
			Ready, sir.
			At your signal.
			Aye, Captain.
			Alright... here we go...
			Energize.
			The lock is holding. I just can't
			resolve the matter stream. Not
			with all that victurium alloy in
			the way.
			Commander Riker. You'll have to
			get him out into the corridor.
			That's gotta weigh over a ton,
			Data. Can you move it?
			Yes, sir. However, that may
			initiate the collapse of the
			surrounding supports. I recommend
			that you and Geordi return to the
			ship.
			Agreed.
			La Forge...
			I'm locked onto Commander Data
			and the boy, sir. I'll energize
			as soon as they've cleared the
			bulkheads.
			Whenever you're ready, Data.
			Yes, Sir.
			You're gonna lift that?
			Yes. Then I will carry you to
			the corridor. We will transport
			back to the Enterprise from there.
			Do you understand?
			How can you pick up something so
			heavy?
			I am an android. My strength is
			many times that of a human.
			Everything is going to be... okay.
			I will count to three.
			One... two... three...
			Energize!
			Captain's Log, supplemental. A
			thorough search of the Vico has
			revealed no additional survivors.
			Troi has begun the process of
			counseling the boy in regard to
			the tragedy.
			We were in the Black Cluster.
			I don't know where they came
			from... but they had a big ship
			-- they kept shooting at us. Then
			they beamed over. They had purple
			helmets on and phaser rifles.
			I saw them. But they didn't see
			me...
			You're safe now, Timothy. You're
			going to be alright.
			You must be hungry. Would you
			like me to get you something to
			eat?
			Counselor, I must join Commander
			La Forge in engineering. If you
			will excuse me --
			Timothy, would you like Data to
			stay a little bit longer?
			Yes.
			Sections of the primary and
			secondary hull were torn right
			off.
			Shearing planes are here, here,
			and here.
			How much longer until we can
			access their logs?
			Less than an hour.
			The boy was here.
			The hallway outside the computer
			core.
			His mother was the ship's systems
			engineer.
			The second away team found her
			body here -- inside the core.
			And the boy's father?
			Ship's second officer.
			He was most likely on the bridge
			when it was exposed to space.
			Most likely...
			He'll sleep for a few hours at
			least.
			There's no need to keep him here.
			But I will need to see him again
			tomorrow.
			You've got some work cut out for
			you.
			His world is gone, Data. We're
			going to have to help him build
			a new one.
			This isn't good. I think whatever
			hit the Vico set up an E-M pulse
			that flashed through their
			computer banks.
			Nearly eighty-three percent of
			the records have been lost.
			And all of their sensor logs.
			Let's use what we got from our own
			sensors. Call up the structural
			analysis and the surface scans...
			Geordi, as a child, did you ever
			experience a traumatic event?
			You're wondering about Timothy?
			Yes.
			I was trapped in a fire once, when
			I was five -- before I got my
			VISOR. It only took about two
			minutes before my parents found
			me and pulled me out. And nobody
			got hurt. But I tell you -- that
			was the longest two minutes of
			my life. And it was more than
			a month before I would let my
			parents get out of earshot. I
			absolutely needed to know they
			were there.
			Timothy no longer has that kind
			of support.
			Yeah...
			Dara and her brother found
			themselves in the land of Tagas...
			... where the ruler, Elamos the
			Magnificent, had proclaimed as
			law:
			"No children will be tolerated
			within the Great Kingdom."
			When Dara saw the proclamation,
			she just laughed, saying "How
			magnificent a ruler, to be
			frightened by the likes of us... "
			Timothy, we're done with sculpture
			for now.
			It's not finished.
			We'll come back to it next period.
			Why don't you pick up your
			mythology book and follow along?
			But it's not finished...
			Magnetic residual analysis
			confirms that the Vico was
			attacked inside the Black Cluster.
			The graviton wave fronts pushed
			the ship to where we found it.
			No sign of phaser burns on the
			hull.
			No, sir. The torsional stress
			levels point to a disrupter-style
			weapon.
			Fracture points indicate that the
			energy burst came from a range
			of less than three thousand
			meters.
			That's a strategy consistent with
			a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or
			Klingon... But we're quite a
			distance from either of their
			territories.
			The Breen have outposts in this
			sector. The attack on the Vico
			is consistent with their battle
			tactics -- and their level of
			technology.
			But what would they have been
			doing inside the Black Cluster?
			The boy described a boarding
			party, with helmets and phaser
			rifles.
			A boarding party?
			I don't think that's likely,
			sir...
			Counselor...
			There was absolutely no evidence
			of anybody coming on board the
			Vico. We would have found a
			transporter field trace. Or if
			somebody had used the entry
			ports, we would have found an
			electrostatic differential in
			the docking latches. We didn't.
			Maybe he's got an active
			imagination.
			Or he's lying.
			If he is lying, I haven't been
			able to sense it. Perhaps his
			level of emotional trauma is too
			high.
			Why wouldn't he tell us the truth?
			He's still in shock... it's hard
			to know what's going on in his
			mind.
			I'll check the sensor readings
			again... but I'm almost sure we
			won't find anything.
			Data -- stay a moment.
			Captain -- I think we should ask
			Data to spend some time with
			Timothy.
			I do not understand.
			I'm worried about his
			behavior... And what you've just
			told me doesn't make me feel any
			better. Data, you're the only
			one Timothy's reached out to...
			because you rescued him. We can
			use your relationship with him
			to help his recovery.
			Would Timothy also be more
			inclined to tell Data the truth
			about what happened?
			That's a possibility.
			Mister Data, proceed with the
			child as Counselor Troi suggests.
			Yes, sir.
			Exactly how shall I proceed,
			Counselor?
			Just be with him. You're a
			presence he trusts. That's what
			he needs most right now.
			What.
			Data.
			Hello, Timothy. May I enter?
			Yeah.
			I see you are attempting to
			recreate the Dokkaran temple of
			Kural-Hanesh.
			Isn't it great?!
			See, there's the big archway
			the teacher told us about.
			That's where everybody came in.
			That's where they stood. And
			that's where the altar was -- by
			the big windows.
			What do you think?
			Do you wish a frank evaluation?
			It lacks the harmony that
			characterized this particular
			temple and Dokkaran culture in
			general.
			You hate it.
			I am not capable of hatred.
			I can't do anything right.
			You are making an unwarranted
			extrapolation. I was merely
			offering an aesthetic analysis
			of this particular model.
			I told you.
			Timothy... ?
			What.
			May I suggest a different
			approach?
			You are attempting to construct
			the upper tiers before you have
			completed the lower.
			Observe.
			La Forge to Data.
			Data here.
			I need your help with the shield
			modulators.
			I will join you in a moment,
			Geordi. Data out.
			Commander La Forge requires my
			assistance.
			Incredible.
			How come you can do that?
			I am designed to exceed human
			capacity both mentally and
			physically.
			Androids are better than humans?
			"Better" is a highly subjective
			term. I do not, for example,
			possess the ability to experience
			emotions as humans do.
			No emotions? You mean you can't
			be happy or sad?
			That is correct.
			Why not?
			My positronic brain is not capable
			of generating those conditions.
			Can we build something else
			later?
			That would be acceptable.
			Bye.
			Goodbye.
			I am designed to exceed human
			capacity...
			That is correct...
			The Black Cluster was formed
			almost nine billion years ago when
			hundreds of protostars collapsed
			in close proximity. The resulting
			gravitational forces are violent
			and highly unpredictable.
			To get anywhere near the center,
			we'll have to push through the
			gravitational wavefronts -- just
			like the science vessel was
			designed to do. I've adjusted
			our shields accordingly.
			The gravitational forces will
			affect sensor accuracy. Detecting
			an enemy vessel will be difficult.
			Maybe that's what happened to the
			Vico -- they didn't see anything
			coming until it was too late.
			Has the boy volunteered any
			further information?
			No. But we have an appointment
			in less than an hour.
			If there's any possibility of
			getting more from him, I'd like
			you to pursue it.
			Regardless, we need to continue
			our investigation.
			We'll enter the cluster at
			oh-seven-hundred tomorrow morning.
			Dismissed.
			Hello, Timothy. Are you ready
			to go?
			Yes, Counselor. I am ready.
			How are you feeling, Timothy?
			I am functioning within
			established parameters.
			Established parameters? You
			sound like Data.
			I am an android.
			I see... Well. Let's go for our
			walk, shall we?
			That would be acceptable.
			Androids do not need to eat or
			drink.
			However, sometimes we like to
			taste things.
			A Tamarin frost, please.
			Would you like anything,
			Counselor?
			No, I'm fine, thank you.
			As you wish.
			So... you're no longer a Human?
			I'm an android.
			When did this happen?
			I've always been an android.
			What's it like... being an
			android?
			I am designed to exceed human
			capacity both mentally and
			physically. But I do not
			experience emotions.
			You don't? No emotions at all?
			That is correct.
			An android.
			I know it sounds unusual - but
			it is understandable.
			Technically, it's called
			enantiodromia. Conversion into
			the opposite. Timothy went from
			Human to machine. From being
			emotional to being emotionless.
			But the underlying trauma is still
			there. He's just found a new way
			to repress it.
			How long will this behavior last?
			As long as he needs it to.
			Timothy is rebuilding his identity
			as best he can. The android
			persona is only one step along
			the way. When he becomes stronger
			and more sure of himself, it
			should drop away naturally.
			I assume this is not a time to
			confront him about what happened
			to his ship.
			Not yet. The best thing we can
			do right now is to let Timothy
			take us where he wants to go.
			We should support the process
			-- even encourage it.
			Mister Data -- I'd like you to
			make Timothy the best android he
			can possibly be.
			Timothy, your head movements
			are... counterproductive. Can
			you be still?
			But you do it.
			The servo-mechanisms in my neck
			are designed to approximate Human
			movements.
			I did not realize the effect was
			so... distracting.
			I like it.
			Data, are there any other androids
			in Starfleet?
			No. I am the only one.
			How come you're not captain?
			My service experience does not
			yet warrant such a position.
			Data, what's the scariest thing
			that ever happened to you?
			Fear is a quality that I do not
			possess.
			Because it's an emotion.
			That is correct.
			But what if you had a nightmare?
			I have never had a nightmare.
			I do not require sleep.
			Timothy, are you having...
			disturbing dreams?
			I do not require sleep.
			Is it satisfactory?
			It's perfect.
			Transfer circuits are functioning
			properly.
			Within established parameters?
			Absolutely.
			Input processing, pattern
			recognition... all within
			established parameters.
			Thank you, Doctor.
			I ran out of red ochre.
			You may use mine.
			Thank you.
			Perhaps you should return to your
			quarters.
			I'm fine.
			The servo-mechanisms in my mouth
			are designed to approximate human
			movements.
			Not bad.
			Thank you.
			It is very... expressive.
			Thank you.
			Is your painting representative
			of something?
			It's just a painting.
			Timothy, you understand that you
			may speak with me about anything
			you wish -- any subject.
			I understand...
			At times I too find it difficult
			to share my thoughts with others.
			I am not always confident that
			I am expressing myself in a way
			that Humans will comprehend. But
			I know that...
			That's fine.
			Just make sure the tolerance
			doesn't slip more than point three
			one in either direction.
			Hello, Geordi.
			Hey, Data.
			I hope I am not disturbing your
			work.
			Nope. Just finishing up here.
			You need something?
			I would like to confide in you,
			Geordi. However, I am finding
			my thoughts difficult to
			verbalize.
			It's about Timothy.
			How did you know?
			If I had a boy going around
			pretending to be just like me,
			I might be a little uncomfortable
			too.
			I am not capable of being
			uncomfortable. But I am
			undergoing a perceptual paradigm
			shift.
			You better define that for me,
			Data.
			I have spent my entire life
			emulating Humans. Now, I find
			myself confronted by a Human who
			is emulating me.
			I got you... the shoe's on the
			other foot...
			Ah, the metaphor... yes, that is
			correct. I am forced to realize
			that I have largely ignored the
			aspects of myself that others
			would find attractive.
			That's a very Human thing to do,
			Data.
			A lot of us have a way of not
			appreciating ourselves. We're
			too close to the subject.
			Keep an eye on Timothy... he might
			help you learn to understand
			yourself a little better.
			We are approaching the perimeter.
			I'm picking up the gravitational
			wavefronts.
			Engage forward shields --
			thirty-five percent.
			Shields up.
			Drop to one quarter impulse,
			Ensign.
			Yes, Sir.
			Bridge to engineering.
			Adjusting shield frequencies now,
			Commander. We'll have this
			smoothed out in just a second...
			Correct for any course deviations,
			Ensign.
			Yes, sir.
			Resume one-third impulse.
			-- Captain!
			I am reading something at four
			hundred thousand kilometers, off
			our starboard bow. Possibly a
			ship.
			Red alert.
			Take us to visual range, Ensign.
			Adjusting course...
			Sensor readings have
			disappeared... Now picking up
			another reading at four hundred
			thousand kilometers -- off the
			port bow.
			It's gone... No -- it's back to
			starboard.
			Captain, the Black Cluster is
			distorting the sensors. We're
			picking up echoes of the Enterprise
			reflecting off the wavefronts.
			Cancel Red Alert. Adjust the
			sensors to compensate for the
			distortion.
			Aye...
			Sensor difficulties have been
			reported by ships traveling
			through Black Clusters -- but not
			to this extreme.
			This formation is seven times more
			massive than any previously
			explored. That could explain the
			difference.
			Resume previous course.
			Yes, sir.
			He laughed.
			Yes. It's nice to see, isn't
			it... ?
			It is certainly not consistent
			with his android persona...
			I'd say he's beginning the process
			of letting go of that fantasy...
			Then my work with him is complete?
			No, I don't think it is, Data...
			A laugh is one step in the right
			direction... we need to help him
			take a few more steps...
			How, Counselor?
			I'd like you to talk to him...
			about your own fascination with
			humanity.
			If you can explain the appeal that
			humanity has for you... Timothy
			might find it easier to become
			a boy again.
			This is great. How's yours?
			The complex polysaccharides, in
			reaction with the carbon dioxide,
			produces an unusual combination
			of texture and efforvescence.
			But how does it taste? Is it
			good?
			I am not capable of "tasting" in
			the manner which you describe.
			I can analyze the composition of
			a dessert and make comparative
			conclusions about its possible
			effect on the human palate.
			However, I neither like it, nor
			dislike it...
			Oh. I didn't realize that.
			I have often wondered what it must
			be like... to have one's mouth
			"water" in anticipation of the
			arrival of a confection... Or
			to feel the pleasure I have
			observed in people as they consume
			it...
			You sound like you don't want to
			be an android.
			I am an android. That will never
			change.
			But... if you could change...
			would you?
			I have always wished to be Human.
			I study people carefully in order
			to more closely approximate Human
			behavior.
			Why? We're stronger and smarter
			than Humans... we can do more than
			they can.
			But I cannot take pride in my
			abilities. I cannot take
			pleasure in my accomplishments.
			But we never feel bad, either...
			I would gladly risk feeling bad
			at times... if it meant that I
			could also taste my dessert.
			Captain, gravitational wavefront
			intensity is increasing steadily
			-- eleven hundred standard "G"
			units and rising.
			Let's see if anyone's out there.
			Attempt a wide-range sensor sweep,
			Lieutenant Worf.
			Aye, sir.
			The gravitational distortion is
			too great, Captain. The scanning
			signal is again being reflected
			off the wavefronts. But I am
			unable to compensate.
			The sensors are useless.
			Mister Data to the bridge, please.
			Acknowledged.
			Adjust sensors to short range...
			attempt a limited positron scan...
			Aye, sir.
			The distortion is still in effect.
			Try to jacket the scanning beam.
			The secondary beam is being
			distorted as well.
			Mister Data, our sensors have been
			rendered ineffective by the field
			distortion. I want your
			analysis...
			Mister Worf, fire phasers, maximum
			intensity, narrow spectrum, zero
			zero one mark zero four five.
			An experiment, Captain?
			Exactly.
			Firing, Sir.
			Explanation, Mister Data.
			The phaser energy was reflected
			by the gravitational wavefronts.
			It is similar to the phenomenon
			distorting the sensor signals.
			Our sensors and our phasers --
			both useless.
			This reflection phenomenon --
			would it have the same effect on
			a disruptor-style weapon?
			Yes, sir. Disruptors would be
			ineffectual.
			And a ship's cloaking field?
			It would be extremely difficult
			to maintain.
			Mister Data, is it at all likely
			that the Vico was attacked inside
			the cluster?
			Given the effects we have
			observed, the probability is
			exceedingly remote.
			Picard to Troi.
			Yes, Captain?
			Please bring Timothy to my ready
			room.
			Timothy, can you tell us what
			happened to your ship?
			I did tell you.
			Tell us again...
			We were attacked.
			That is highly unlikely. Our
			investigations have clearly
			demonstrated --
			-- We were attacked! We were
			attacked!
			Timothy, androids do not lie.
			It was me.
			Please explain.
			It was me. I did it. I killed
			them all...
			Everything was shaking. I lost
			my balance. I was just trying
			to hold on to something. I didn't
			mean to do it.
			What didn't you mean to do,
			Timothy?
			My arm... it hit the computer
			panel. That's what destroyed the
			ship.
			The ship was damaged when your
			arm hit the computer panel... ?
			Timothy, listen to me -- the
			damage to your ship might have
			occurred at the same time you
			touched the panel but it was only
			a coincidence... this was not
			your fault...
			Yes it was...
			It is not possible. The onboard
			control systems for every starship
			require a user code clearance.
			You could not have inadvertantly
			affected any of the Vico's
			systems.
			Your computer had safety
			precautions. There's nothing
			you could have touched that would
			have damaged your ship.
			You're not responsible for what
			happened to your parents.
			But if it wasn't me...
			We're trying to determine what
			happened right now. And anything
			that you can remember that may
			assist...
			That's just how it was... when
			it started on the Vico...
			Wavefront intensity has
			increased...
			Increase shields to seventy-five
			percent.
			Aye.
			Damage, Mister Worf.
			Minimal, Sir. The shields are
			holding.
			Ensign, full about -- go to warp
			two.
			The gravitational distortion is
			too high -- we can't maintain a
			warp field.
			We couldn't get out either...
			Full shields.
			Aye.
			Captain -- impulse power has been
			disrupted. The helm won't
			respond.
			Timothy, I think you and I should
			go below... get out of everyone's
			way, okay... ?
			No...
			Riker to La Forge. Can you give
			me more power to the shields?
			Stand by...
			That's what they kept saying --
			"more shields," "more shields."
			Timothy, accompany me...
			I want you to recall everything
			you heard people say aboard the
			Vico before it was destroyed...
			I don't know. Just that. Just
			"more shields"...
			I've transferred fusion reactors
			four through nine into the shield
			array.
			That should double the shield
			strength.
			Wavefront intensity has increased
			by an order of magnitude. Impact
			in three - two - one.
			Wave front intensity is
			continuing to increase.
			Structural overpressure is
			exceeding one hundred eighty
			percent.
			La Forge...
			I don't understand. That should
			have been enough.
			We could run the shield grid
			directly off the warp drive.
			Make it so.
			Initiating warp transfer pathways
			now...
			Diverting warp power to the
			shields.
			"Warp power to the shields"...
			they said that too, Data... I'm
			positive...
			Wavefront intensity has increased
			by a factor of ten. Contact in
			forty-seven seconds. Without
			additional power to the shields,
			the outer hull will not hold...
			La Forge...
			Warp transfer to the shields
			complete. That's as strong as
			they're gonna get.
			Impact in fifteen seconds.
			Drop the shields.
			That's suicide, Data.
			Captain, drop the shields.
			Drop the shields.
			Aye.
			Our own shields caused the
			increase in the wavefronts...
			we induced harmonic
			amplification effects.
			The more energy we dumped into
			the shield grid, the worse the
			impact...
			Precisely. And that is also what
			destroyed the Vico. When Timothy
			remembered similar procedures
			aboard his ship, I initiated an
			analysis of shield output to
			wavefront amplitude and discovered
			a correlation.
			If we had transferred all that
			warp power to the shields, it
			would've torn the ship apart.
			Status, Ensign.
			Navigation is coming back on line.
			Full about, one quarter impulse.
			Take us out of here.
			It would seem that our young
			"android" is finding his way back
			to humanity.
			It would appear so, Counselor.
			It'll take a while for his
			emotions to catch up. Timothy's
			a boy feeling a great deal of
			pain. But he is a boy again.
			Is this.. difficult for you, Data?
			Difficult?
			To watch him... moving away from
			being like you...
			No, Counselor. That would require
			an emotional context which I
			cannot provide.
			Hello, Timothy.
			How are you, Data?
			I am operating within established
			parameters. How are you?
			I'm fine.
			Is something wrong?
			You probably thought I was pretty
			silly. When I had my hair like
			yours and everything.
			On the contrary, it is said that
			imitation is the highest form of
			flattery. I was... flattered.
			Can we still do things together
			-- even if I'm not really an
			android?
			I have many Human friends. I
			would be pleased to count you
			among them.
			That would be...
			...acceptable.
