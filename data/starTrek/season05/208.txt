			Captain's log, stardate 45233.1.
			Our terraforming mission to Doraf
			One has been suddenly cancelled
			and the Enterprise recalled to
			Starbase Two-thirty-four. Fleet
			Admiral Brackett would not discuss
			the matter on subspace for
			reasons she said would soon be
			clear...
			I apologize for the mystery,
			Captain... but we must attempt
			to contain the information I'm
			about to reveal to you... at least
			as long as possible...
			I will admit you've piqued my
			curiosity, Admiral.
			Three weeks ago, one of our most
			celebrated ambassadors -- an
			advisor to Federation leaders for
			generations -- disappeared. He
			left no word of his destination.
			Two days ago, intelligence reports
			placed him on Romulus -- and I
			assure you it's an unauthorized
			visit. Computer, initiate linkage
			between this terminal and starbase
			computer system alpha-two-nine.
			Linkage complete.
			A defection?
			If it is, the damage to Federation
			security would be incalculable.
			Taken on Romulus, by long-range
			scanner. Computer, enhance image
			in section four-delta.
			Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.
			As I study the intelligence
			reports on Ambassador Spock's
			disappearance, I cannot help but
			feel a deeper, more personal
			concern about this mission, for
			I know this man through his
			father. It was barely a year ago
			that I shared a mind meld with
			the Vulcan Sarek... now we must
			meet again as I attempt to find
			an explanation for his son's
			actions.
			We'll be coming into orbit of
			Vulcan in less than an hour,
			Captain... you may want to get
			some rest...
			Yes, yes, of course, you're
			right...
			We should notify Sarek's wife of
			our plans...
			All taken care of, sir... she'll
			be transporting aboard at oh-seven
			hundred...
			And Sarek?
			She says he is too ill to join
			her.
			Not unexpected. The man is dying.
			And I have the... honor... to
			bring him the news that his son
			may have betrayed the Federation.
			How well do you know Spock?
			I met him only once... what I know
			of him comes from history books
			and of course the mind meld with
			his father...
			That must cover a lot of ground...
			Not as much as you'd imagine...
			Sarek and Spock...
			... Well, sometimes, fathers and
			sons...
			Understood.
			Oh there was one other thing...
			take a look at this...
			Something that turned up during
			the intelligence sweep... what
			do you make of it?
			Metal fragments, possibly
			disassembled components,
			identified as Vulcan... recovered
			from a downed Ferengi ship...
			And the crates they were in were
			marked as medical supplies.
			Contraband?
			They've been sent to Vulcan for
			identification... Starfleet has
			requested we lend them a hand...
			Captain Picard...
			Perrin...
			It's good to see you again.
			And you. How is Sarek?
			He has good days... and bad days.
			More and more they're bad...
			Then the disease has progressed...
			It is a cruel killer. Sarek
			deserves a noble death... instead
			he is trapped in this lingering
			madness...
			It must be very hard for you.
			Every day I can share with him
			is a gift. The pain will be in
			losing him.
			I hope that will not be soon.
			There's no way to tell. At times
			I think he won't make it through
			another night... and then it seems
			he's strong enough to live for
			years...
			I admire your strength more than
			I can tell you.
			Mint tea... it's been years since
			I've had it... Vulcans have some
			strange concoction they call
			"mint"... but you wouldn't
			recognize it...
			Perrin... you know why I've come
			to Vulcan.
			I must ask you about Spock.
			He didn't even say good-bye to
			his father before he left.
			Is it possible he was abducted?
			No. He wrapped up his affairs
			very carefully. He knew he was
			going.
			Do you have any idea why he might
			have disappeared like this?
			Captain, as far as I'm concerned
			he disappeared a long time ago.
			Excuse me for sounding like the
			wicked stepmother...
			Would it be inappropriate to ask
			what happened between you and
			Spock?
			Not between us. Between Spock
			and his father. They had argued
			for years; that was family...
			but when the debates over the
			Cardassian war began, he attacked
			Sarek's position... publicly...
			he showed no loyalty to his
			father...
			I was not aware that Sarek was
			offended by Spock's opposition...
			I was offended. And I made sure
			Spock knew it.
			I am very protective of my
			husband. I do not apologize for
			it.
			Would Sarek have any idea why
			Spock might have left?
			I don't know.
			If you could see Sarek as I do...
			wasting in bed... whispering to
			himself...
			He wants to see his son... to heal
			any rifts that still remain...
			but now it may be too late.
			Perrin... would you allow me to
			see Sarek?
			If it were anyone else... I would
			never permit it.
			But you are a part of him... and
			he of you...
			The Vulcans can't figure out what
			these fragments are... but
			they've identified the metal as
			a dentarium alloy.
			That pretty well indicates
			that they're Vulcan...
			And dentarium also means that
			whatever this was, it was designed
			for use in space.
			From the look of the damage,
			must've been a high-speed impact.
			A Ferengi cargo shuttle that went
			down in the Hanolin asteroid
			belt... the debris was spread over
			one hundred square kilometers.
			Could it be a weapons array?
			That was my first thought. But
			the Vulcans don't have any record
			of stolen weapons. Or stolen
			parts, for that matter.
			This is gonna be like putting
			together a big jig-saw puzzle when
			you don't know what the picture
			is supposed to be.
			He's like this most of the time...
			his emotions have taken over.
			Sometimes I can bring him out of
			it.
			Sarek! You will listen!
			Go from me!
			Picard is here.
			No -- more -- chaos!
			I'll leave you alone. He'll
			either acknowledge you... or he
			won't.
			Sarek, I have come a long way to
			see you.
			I will not answer -- !
			I must speak to you about your
			son...
			I want no one with me --
			About Spock.
			Spock?
			Yes. He's missing.
			Is that you, Picard... ?
			Yes, my friend.
			You came here... to Vulcan...
			I need your help. I must find
			Spock.
			He is not here...
			I know. He is reported on
			Romulus.
			On Romulus... why?
			That's what I hope to find out
			from you.
			On Romulus...
			You're going there, aren't you?
			To find him.
			Yes.
			Have you any idea what might have
			taken him to Romulus?
			No.
			Is there anyone on Romulus that
			he might know... or choose to
			contact?
			Pardek...
			Who is Pardek?
			It could be Pardek...
			Who is Pardek?
			He is a Romulan Senator. Spock
			has maintained a relationship with
			him over the years... I don't know
			where they met. The Khitomer
			Conference, I'd imagine.
			Pardek represented Romulus?
			Yes... yes I'm quite sure he
			did...
			... in fact I recall Spock coming
			to me with optimism about a
			continuing dialogue with the
			Romulans at one point... and I
			told him it was clearly an
			illogical expectation... Spock
			is always so impressionable...
			this Romulan Pardek had no support
			at home... and of course in the
			end, I was proven correct.
			I tried to give him the benefit
			of experience, of logic... but
			he never listened. He never
			listened...
			It has been suggested... that
			Spock may have defected.
			Never. I can accept many things,
			but not that.
			But you believe he might be there
			to see Pardek...
			The Romulan Senator? How do you
			know Pardek?
			I've heard of him.
			That's what he's done. Gone to
			see Pardek.
			Do you know what business they
			could have together?
			No.
			I never knew what Spock was doing.
			When he was a boy, he would
			disappear for days into the
			mountains.
			I asked him where he had gone,
			what he had done... he refused
			to answer. I insisted he tell
			me... but he would not. I forbade
			him to go... he ignored me. I
			punished him... he endured it
			silently. And always, he returned
			to the mountains.
			One might as well tell the river
			not to flow...
			Secretly... I admired him... that
			proud core of him that would not
			yield...
			Sarek, we are a part of each
			other. I know Spock has caused
			you pain... but I also know you
			love him...
			Tell him, Picard...
			Peace and long life, Sarek.
			Live long and... and...
			... live long and...
			Spock... my son...
			... and prosper.
			Captain's log, stardate 45240.1.
			To cross the Neutral Zone, I will
			require a cloaked ship. To that
			end, I have set a course for the
			Klingon Home World. After all we
			did for Gowron during the recent
			war, I am certain he will be happy
			to return a favor.
			Still no response from the
			Klingons, Mister Worf?
			Nossir.
			He's ignoring me... what other
			explanation is there?
			Seems like, after three days of
			hailing him, he could've found
			a minute to talk to you...
			Sir...
			Yes, Lieutenant?
			I believe I know why our messages
			are not being answered. Gowron...
			has been rewriting Klingon
			history.
			Rewriting history?
			He is claiming that it was his
			courage... his genius... which
			brought about an end to the civil
			war.
			I see.
			In the new version... there is
			no mention made of the
			Federation's help in his rise to
			power.
			If Worf's right, our arrival
			would be an uncomfortable
			reminder of the facts...
			Victors re-write the history
			books. He can take every bit of
			credit, I'll gladly grant him
			that. But I need a ship.
			If Gowron won't talk to me... get
			somebody who will, somebody on
			the High Council, K'Tal perhaps...
			Yes, Captain.
			Captain, I have a visual
			identification of Senator Pardek
			of Romulus...
			This is a Barolian record of a
			trade negotiation in which Pardek
			participated four years ago...
			That's all?
			Yessir.
			Run it again.
			Call up the intelligence
			scan of Spock on Romulus...
			Same man... Pardek...
			One question answered.
			What do we know of him?
			He has been in public service
			since he was a young man... a
			senator for nine decades. He is
			considered a "man of the
			people... " He has sponsored many
			reforms. Reportedly, he is
			considered by the Romulan
			leadership to be something of a
			radical because he has been an
			advocate for peace throughout his
			career.
			I can see why Spock would
			cultivate a relationship with him.
			Yessir.
			Where are we likely to find him
			-- other than on the floor of the
			Romulan Senate?
			The district he represents is
			called the Krocton Segment. He
			maintains a dwelling there.
			Very good, Mister Data.
			There is more, sir... I took the
			liberty of expanding the
			perameters of my search... and
			have discovered that Pardek has
			several relatives in the Krocton
			Segment. It is likely that you
			will be able to locate him there
			on the third day of the Romulan
			week when the Senate is not in
			session.
			Your resourcefulness never ceases
			to amaze me.
			Thank you, sir.
			If I ever get to Romulus, Data,
			I am going to need help. I'd like
			you to accompany me.
			To the surface, sir?
			Yes...
			I understand how you can be made
			to look Romulan, but I believe
			it will be more difficult to
			transform an android, Captain.
			I think Doctor Crusher can come
			up with something...
			Captain... we are being hailed
			by the Klingon Home World.
			Gowron or K'Tal?
			Neither, sir... it is the junior
			adjutant to the diplomatic
			delegation.
			Junior adjutant.
			Name.
			B'ijik, sir.
			On screen.
			Greetings, Captain. I regret to
			inform you that Gowron and the
			High Council are quite busy and
			won't be able to speak with you
			today.
			Is he aware that we've been
			transmitting messages for three
			days?
			Messages? I'll have to inspect
			the logs... but I'm sure we
			haven't received any...
			It is of the utmost importance
			that I speak with Gowron...
			Captain, Gowron wishes it were
			possible to talk with everyone
			who wants an audience. But he
			is one man... the demands on his
			time are formidable. If you would
			like me to take him a message...
			A message. Very well.
			Tell Gowron, Leader of the High
			Council of the Klingon Empire,
			that his Arbiter of Succession,
			Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favor.
			A favor?
			I require a cloaked vessel.
			A cloaked vessel. This is no
			small favor, Captain.
			It is for a mission that could
			have repercussions throughout the
			quadrant.
			How would it benefit the Klingon
			Empire? I'm sure Gowron will
			ask...
			The only benefit to the Klingon
			Empire... would be our gratitude.
			That's what you want me to tell
			Gowron... .?
			Yes. And please add that if he
			is unable to provide a ship, I
			am sure there are others in the
			Klingon Empire who would be
			willing to help me. And then they
			would have our gratitude.
			I see.
			Also please tell him that I am
			immensely gratified that he is
			prospering so well. It is a
			tribute to his skilled leadership.
			They aren't removable, are they,
			Data?
			Removable, Doctor?
			Your ears.
			No, Doctor... they are fully
			integrated components.
			We'll need molds of his ears
			too...
			What about his skin color?
			We'll have to do some tests with
			his skin pigmentation. Changing
			it to appear Romulan shouldn't
			be too hard... I just want to be
			sure we can change it back again
			afterwards.
			The right eye is point-zero-zero-
			four higher than the left...
			It is not...
			You want a proper fit on your
			prosthetic? Trust your tailor.
			I won't tell a soul, sir.
			Anything from Gowron?
			Nosir. But after your tailor is
			done, would you join me in the
			cargo bay... La Forge has made
			some progress on those metal
			fragments...
			These two still have to report
			to Mister Mott to get their
			hairpieces designed...
			Thirty minutes, Number One.
			What we seem to have here is a
			navigational deflector array.
			Or at least what's left of one.
			Why would anyone want a Vulcan
			deflector?
			Beats me, Commander. Every
			question we answer here seems to
			bring up two more.
			You're certain it is Vulcan...
			Yes, sir. A metallurgical
			analysis confirmed that... and
			by running a molecular pattern
			trace, we even identified the ship
			as the T'Pau.
			It was decommissioned years ago
			and sent to the surplus depot at
			Qualor Two. As far as anyone
			knows it's still there.
			Worf to Captain Picard...
			Yes, Lieutenant?
			A Klingon vessel is decloaking
			off our port bow. Compliments
			of Gowron.
			Please convey our gratitude,
			Mister Worf. Advise the captain
			that Lieutenant Commander Data
			and I will be transporting aboard
			shortly.
			Aye, sir.
			I'd like to take the Enterprise
			to Qualor Two... see what I can
			find out there.
			Agreed.
			When I received my orders... I
			was not told where we were going.
			But the heading I was given...
			takes us into the Neutral Zone...
			and to Romulus.
			That's right.
			I know my duty, Captain... when
			I'm given orders, I follow them.
			But I do not like secrets. I want
			to know why we are on this
			mission.
			I'm sorry. It is a confidential
			matter.
			You're going after the defector,
			aren't you?
			Defector...
			You think information like that
			stays a secret? Ambassador Spock
			has gone to Romulus... and you're
			going after him.
			Your orders are to take us to a
			set of coordinates near Romulus...
			and to bring us back. That is
			all I am prepared to discuss.
			If we are discovered by the
			Romulans... it means death for
			all of us.
			I realize that.
			Hechu' ghoS...
			Very well, Captain. We have set
			a course for Romulus.
			It may not be what you're used
			to on a Starfleet ship.
			Quite nice. Thank you.
			Is this the captain's quarters,
			or mine?
			Both.
			We have limited space. We're a
			military ship, not a pleasure
			craft.
			Of course. This will be fine.
			You'll sleep Klingon style... we
			don't soften our bodies by putting
			down a pad...
			Good. I prefer it that way.
			You'll take your meals with us...
			and we don't serve Federation
			food.
			I haven't had gagh in a while...
			been looking forward to it. Very
			fresh.
			MeH HoD... (Bridge to Captain)
			Jatlh! (Speak!)
			MeHmaH ghoS... (We are
			approaching the Neutral Zone.)
			So'wl'chu'. (Prepare to engage
			the cloaking device.)
			Well, Captain... we're at the
			border of the Neutral Zone.
			You mean to do this, do you?
			Yes. I do.
			First Officer's log, stardate
			45240.6. The Enterprise is
			nearing Qualor Two -- home of a
			Federation surplus depot operated
			by the Zakdorn. We hope to find
			out how the salvaged deflector
			array ended up in the hands of
			the Ferengi.
			I have made contact, Commander.
			On screen.
			I'm Commander William Riker of
			the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			Klim Dokachin, quartermaster of
			Surplus Depot Zed-One-Five.
			We need some information about
			a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It was
			sent there a few years ago.
			Did you arrange an appointment?
			Appointment... no...
			Then I will be unable to help you.
			You may communicate with
			scheduling.
			Who does he think he is?
			The quartermaster of the surplus
			yard, Commander. With information
			you need.
			Right. Mister Worf...
			reestablish communication.
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Dokaychin...
			Dokahchin... Klim Dokahchin...
			Mister Dokahchin, the information
			I need involves a matter of major
			importance to the Federation.
			Uh huh.
			I'll need access to your logs,
			your files...
			It won't take long. My people
			can do the work.
			I don't allow outsiders into my
			computer system.
			Fine. One of your people, then.
			I wish I had the people to spare.
			I don't.
			Well, sir... what would you
			suggest?
			I don't know. Contact me when
			you reach orbit.
			I don't believe him.
			He's king of his particular hill,
			Commander. You'll have to treat
			him that way.
			Counselor... a perfect job for
			you.
			Thank you for coming on board,
			Mister Dokachin.
			Quite a ship you have.
			We've tied into your computers.
			If you could access the files...
			I don't usually see them in such
			good condition. By the time they
			get to me, they're always falling
			apart.
			Mister Dokachin, we must find this
			ship -- and you're the only one
			who can help us.
			Who're you?
			Deanna Troi, Ship's Counselor.
			He probably figures we don't get
			to see a lot of handsome women
			out this way -- and someone like
			you might get a little more
			cooperation from me.
			He's probably right.
			What was the name of that ship?
			The T'Pau?
			The T'Pau... Vulcan registry...
			There. Logged in on stardate
			41334.
			Where is the ship now?
			Docked.
			Section eighteen-gamma-twelve.
			Do you want me to take you there?
			I'd appreciate that.
			Helmsman, lay in a heading
			one-four-one by two-zero-eight.
			Ahead slow, two hundred kph.
			I suppose this is your first time
			in a junkyard, isn't it? You'd
			be surprised at some of the things
			I find on board these ships...
			I once found a fourteen foot
			Caldorian eel on board a
			freighter... in someone's
			locker...
			Are you serious?
			If you have time, I'll show it
			to you... I still have it...
			nursed her back to health...
			Commander, we are approaching the
			designated coordinates.
			On screen.
			Where is it? What happened to
			it?
			These are the correct
			coordinates...
			The T'Pau is missing?
			The T'Pau...
			... is missing.
			How could a ship disappear from
			your depot?
			I'm not accustomed to losing
			things, Commander. I'll find your
			ship for you.
			I have the T'Pau cross-referenced
			in four different directories...
			When it was brought here... was
			it stripped of materiel --
			armament, sensors... ?
			Of course...
			Can you tell us what happened
			to its navigational deflector?
			It was routed to the Tripoli, a
			holding vessel on the outer rim
			of the shipyard.
			It's not there anymore. What's
			left of that deflector is laid
			out on the floor of our cargo bay.
			How can that be?
			Maybe we ought to pay a visit to
			the Tripoli...
			In all the time the Zakdorn have
			operated this depot, nothing's
			ever been lost. Never. I'll
			tell you this... somebody will
			pay. I'll conduct an
			investigation. Whoever is
			responsible...
			Approaching the coordinates of
			the Tripoli, sir.
			On screen.
			I do not understand this. This
			is not possible.
			We beam goods to the Tripoli on
			a regular schedule. There was
			a shipment yesterday, and another
			is set for today. It must be
			there.
			When is today's transport?
			Just over two hours from now.
			A shipment of deuterium storage
			tanks.
			Ensign, align the Enterprise so
			we'll appear to be one of the
			abandoned ships. Mister La Forge,
			when we're in position, shut down
			engines and all systems except
			sensors and life support.
			Aye, sir.
			I'm guessing somebody's going to
			be here to receive those storage
			tanks -- and I'd be very
			interested to see who it is.
			These quarters were obviously
			intended for only one crewmember,
			sir. There is a single sleeping
			space.
			I'm sure the Klingons found it
			amusing to put us together in
			here.
			Since I do not require sleep, I
			propose you take the --
			-- shelf. I will be content to
			stand.
			Very well, Mister Data. Thank
			you.
			Are you comfortable, sir?
			I suppose so.
			Good-night, Captain. Sleep well.
			Thank you.
			What are you doing?
			Sir? Was I making noise?
			Not exactly...
			I was processing the information
			we have accumulated on Romulan
			society. I am preparing for the
			task of impersonating a Romulan.
			I see.
			Would you like me to discontinue?
			No, no. Please go ahead.
			What are you looking at?
			I am not looking at anything, sir.
			I am continuing to organize my
			files.
			But you're looking at me.
			I am sorry if I am disturbing you,
			sir. I will not look in your
			direction.
			Sir, do you not wish to sleep?
			I don't think so. Shall we
			continue to go over the files?
			I would be happy to.
			I have been studying the Krocton
			Segment, as you asked, and have
			selected an appropriate site for
			our transport...
			Captain K'Vada to Picard... please
			come to the bridge.
			Captain... we've monitored a
			subspace message that might
			interest you.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Sarek is dead.
			Commander... sensors detect a ship
			approaching at warp speed.
			Identification?
			Negative. No transponder
			signal... no subspace marker...
			Sounds like they don't want to
			be identified.
			The ship is coming out of warp
			now...
			On screen.
			Sensors indicate a combat
			vessel... origin undetermined...
			heavily armed... mass and density
			suggest it's fully loaded with
			cargo. From the look of these
			internal scans, I'd guess a good
			part of that cargo is weaponry.
			The ship is moving into section
			twelve delta four...
			It's taking the position assigned
			to the Tripoli. The coordinates
			are identical.
			Commander... readings indicate
			the surface-to-ship transport has
			begun...
			Bring the engines back on line,
			Mister La Forge... And restore
			all systems to normal.
			Aye, sir.
			He's powering up engines, sir --
			turning starboard.
			Open a channel.
			Open, sir.
			This is Commander William Riker
			of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
			Identify yourself.
			I repeat... you have entered a
			Federation depot... identify
			yourself.
			Sir, the ship is locking
			phasers...
			Shields up. Red alert.
			That ship easily matches our
			armament, Commander.
			It's coming about...
			If you do not respond to our
			hails, we will take that as
			evidence of hostile action.
			There is an energy build-up in
			their phaser banks... sir, they
			are activating weapons!
			Forward shields down to
			seventy-two percent --
			Boost power to the shields...
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf, target their weapon
			systems only and prepare to fire--
			Forward shields at sixty-eight
			percent, aft shields forty
			percent...
			On my mark, a point-seven-five
			burst only. We just want to get
			their attention.
			Ready, sir.
			Fire.
			Their forward shields are damaged,
			sir...
			We destroyed one of their phaser
			arrays... looks like collateral
			damage in the cargo area...
			Sir, I'm picking up massive power
			fluctuations... internal
			explosions... with all the
			armament that ship is carrying
			-- it's gonna blow!
			Well, Mister Data...
			... what do you think?
			I am very pleased, sir. I would
			not have thought it possible.
			I am eager to test the success
			of our efforts. It does remain
			to be seen if the Romulans will
			accept us.
			Sir, you have seemed unusually
			pensive since we received the news
			of Ambassador Sarek's death.
			Sarek and I shared a particular
			bond. Our lives touched in an
			unusual way... I admit that I
			feel the effects of his loss.
			The tenor of our mission has
			changed, at least for me, Data.
			We were sent to confront Spock
			about his disappearance. Now,
			we must also tell him his father
			is dead.
			I am afraid I do not entirely
			understand, sir. As a Vulcan,
			would not Ambassador Spock simply
			see death as a logical result of
			his father's illness... ?
			It is never quite that simple.
			Not even for a Vulcan. Certainly
			not for Spock who is also half
			Human.
			They spent a lifetime in
			conflict... now the chance to
			resolve all of their differences
			is gone.
			Considering the exceptionally long
			lifespan of Vulcans, it does seem
			odd that Spock and Sarek did not
			choose to resolve their
			differences in the time
			available.
			Yes. It really is quite...
			illogical...
			A father and son... both proud,
			both stubborn... more alike than
			either would care to admit.
			They've spent a lifetime building
			emotional barriers. Those aren't
			easy to break down.
			And then the time comes when it
			is too late to try. One realizes
			that all the things he had
			planned to say will go unsaid.
			That is a difficult moment... and
			a lonely one. Spock will now
			have to face that moment.
			Don't you two look sweet...
			Be careful, android... some
			Romulan beauty might take a liking
			to you... lick that paint right
			off your ears...
			Do you know what the Romulans will
			do to you if they discover who
			you are?
			I have a good idea.
			We are ready to be transported
			to the surface.
			Just so we understand each other
			-- my orders don't include rescue
			missions.
			Ah, Senator Pardek. You received
			my message.
			I got here as quickly as I could,
			Proconsul.
			What do you know of this Human?
			Jean-Luc Picard... a Starfleet
			Captain...
			I know nothing of him.
			You haven't seen him recently... ?
			To my knowledge, I've never seen
			him.
			I have received intelligence that
			says he's on his way here.
			Perhaps here already.
			Here -- on Romulus?
			Yes... curious, isn't it? I
			suppose we'd better find out if
			the report is accurate -- or
			merely rumor.
			Circulate his likeness to the
			security forces. Remind them that
			if he is here, he is probably
			disguised as one of us.
			I'll see to it.
			This is definitely the street on
			which the intelligence scan
			of Spock and Pardek was taken,
			sir... adjusting for the optical
			distortion, I am able to verify
			the architectural features...
			Where were they standing?
			Data...
			Sir?
			You're moving about in a very...
			well, android manner...
			I am sorry, Captain. I will be
			more careful.
			And don't call me "Captain."
			Yes, Cap --
			I understand.
			I have located the place where
			they were standing...
			Where?
			It is here --
			-- at this doorway.
			A legal intercessor's office...
			the name is similar to Pardek's.
			It would appear to be one of
			his relatives.
			Not open for business yet...
			Nevertheless, it would be my
			recommendation that we keep this
			location under observation.
			I have clearly determined
			Pardek's routine. On days when
			the Senate is not in session, he
			invariably comes to this section
			after the median hour.
			Very well, why don't we take the
			opportunity to try some of the
			local cuisine...
			What do you recommend?
			Soup.
			That sounds very appealing. I
			will have soup.
			Soup is fine.
			Do you happen to know what time
			the intercessor's office across
			the way opens?
			Why do you want to know?
			I need his services... he was
			recommended.
			I haven't seen you here before.
			We are here for the day... from
			the city of Rateg.
			Rateg. I don't think so.
			Why do you say that?
			You don't sound like you're from
			Rateg.
			It is a misconception that all
			Rategs speak with a particular
			inflection. In fact, there are
			twelve different --
			We come from several kilometers
			outside the city...
			Or perhaps you come from the
			security forces, to watch the
			intercessor's office. Is he in
			trouble?
			Madam, you are mistaken.
			It doesn't matter to me. I don't
			know when he opens. Eat your
			soup. Courtesy of a loyal
			establishment. Jolan True.
			We can't stay here long.
			We may not have to... Direct your
			view to the far corner... is that
			not Pardek?
			I believe you're right...
			Perhaps you should appear to
			enjoy your soup.
			Do not move.
			What? You've made a mistake...
			Quiet. Come with us...
			Wait here.
			For what? Why have you brought
			us here?
			Welcome to Romulus, Captain
			Picard.
			Don't let our "soldiers" alarm
			you... we had to get you off the
			streets quickly. Romulan security
			knows you are here.
			I am Pardek... you are among
			friends, Captain.
			I have come on an urgent mission
			from the Federation. I am looking
			for Ambassador Spock.
			Indeed...
			You have found him, Captain
			Picard.
