			Ship's log, First Officer Riker
			reporting. Stardate 41997.7 We
			are about to make a brief but
			necessary contact with the Jarada,
			a reclusive race known for its
			idiosyncratic attitude towards
			protocol... The Federation has been
			trying unsuccessfully to establish
			a relationship, and now the task
			falls to Captain Picard.
			... In two days we will reach the
			area of their planet, known as
			Torona Four. The Jarada demand
			a precise greeting. Their
			language is most unusual...
			... The slightest mispronunciation
			is regarded as an insult.
			The double bars indicate an
			elongated "s" sound --
			-- And the inverted "T" means to
			hold the "zee."
			Unless... ?
			Unless it's followed by three wavy
			lines; in which case the "zee"
			becomes a "bee."
			Exactly.
			What a language.
			It is an insect mind.
			My mind's barely working.
			Take a break, sir.
			No. I want to go over it again.
			You could be over-preparing.
			You've been looking forward to
			the upgrade of the Holodeck. You
			have the time. You need the
			diversion...
			Dixon Hill.
			The program's installed and
			waiting.
			Planet and city?
			Earth... United States... San
			Francisco, California.
			Time period?
			1941, A.D.
			File or access code.
			File Dixon Hill, private
			detective.
			Enter when ready.
			Very funny, Dix. What'd you do,
			lose another bet?
			I don't understand --
			The bellboy suit. Are you
			moonlighting at the Fremont?
			The uniform. Totally
			inappropriate. Why didn't I
			change?
			Mister Leech called twice, and
			there's a lady named Bradley
			waiting in your office. Nice
			legs.
			Gotta hot date with my fella.
			I'll see ya in the morning.
			Uh, I lost a bet.
			Oh well... At least you're ready
			for Halloween.
			Halloween?
			I need your help, Mister Hill.
			Someone is trying to kill me.
			Captain's log, supplemental. I
			am delighted with how the
			Holodeck has created the
			fictional world of Dixon Hill...
			... the twentieth century
			detective who has been a hero of
			mine since childhood.
			The illusion is flawless. The
			computer characters accept me as
			Dixon Hill, even to the extent that
			Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's
			wife from the wrong side of the
			tracks, wants to hire me.
			I'm not sure who wants me dead.
			My husband... My stepdaughter...
			Or a lover, perhaps?
			Perhaps.
			Perhaps Cyrus Redblock.
			I need you to find out. Name
			your fee.
			Twenty dollars a day. Plus
			expenses.
			Agreed.
			I haven't said yes yet.
			Oh you'll say yes.
			If it's Redblock, he must think
			I've got what he's looking for.
			But believe me, I don't.
			I'll take your word for it.
			Here's a C-note in advance.
			Consider it a retainer...
			... and next time, could you wear
			a suit?
			Remarkable.
			You'll have to call again. I'm
			just leaving. I'm not dressed
			properly. I'll be back.
			Not yet, please --
			Memory: save current setting.
			Current setting saved.
			Holodeck OFF.
			When I looked down on the street,
			I actually saw automobiles!
			An ancient Earth device used
			primarily for transportation.
			Ahh.
			Also seen as a source of status
			and virility; often a prime
			ingredient in teenage mating
			rituals --
			Teenage mating rituals?
			I saw an entire city block from
			that window.
			It sounds wonderful.
			I'm going to try it again, only
			this time I'm going to dress the
			part.
			Why not come with me?
			I also want to take that
			historian... the twentieth century
			expert...
			Whalen.
			Yes, Whalen. He probably knows
			more about Dixon Hill than I do.
			I will tell him.
			Invite him, Mister Data. This
			is, after all, a leisure activity.
			The sense of reality is
			incredible. When that woman
			kissed me, it was so --
			Exciting?
			Real.
			The subject of this meeting is
			the Jaradan rendezvous. Proceed
			with the briefing, Number One.
			This is primarily a necessary
			diplomatic mission. The Jaradan
			are strategically important to the
			Federation. Previous attempts
			failed because they are so easily
			irritated. A slip in the
			pronunciation of the greeting
			caused a twenty-year rift in the
			relation.
			Therefore the captain must recite
			the entire greeting without any
			mistakes.
			Simple as that.
			Yes. If, on the other hand, the
			captain makes even the slightest
			error --
			-- The captain is well aware of
			the gravity of the situation,
			Commander.
			I have located a history tape
			of the last Federation starship
			to come in contact with the
			Jarada. It graphically
			demonstrates what happened when
			that captain offended them.
			The captain is familiar with that,
			Data.
			Should we not run it?
			It's not necessary. Meeting
			adjourned.
			Why would the captain not want
			to review all the information
			available on the subject?
			When you've seen the Jaradan
			react once, you don't ever have
			to see it again.
			Dixon Hill is a most puzzling
			character.
			Not really. He was just a
			twentieth-century Sherlock
			Holmes.
			But his modus operandi is quite
			dissimilar. Worth investigating.
			Indubitably, Watson.
			Computer: request all

			Captain's log, supplemental...
			The Jaradan rendezvous is eleven
			hours away...
			I am about to reenter the world
			of Dixon Hill, this time properly
			dressed. An experience like this
			is more enjoyable when shared,
			so I've invited Lit-historian
			Whalen to accompany me. Doctor
			Crusher will join us shortly...
			Ready to go to San Francisco,
			Mister Whalen?
			More than ready, sir.
			If it's anything like the last
			time I'm sure you won't be
			disappointed --
			Request permission to accompany
			you, sir.
			I have mastered the lingo of the
			period. Example:
			It was raining in the city of
			Angels -- a hard rain -- almost hard
			enough to wash the slime from the
			streets. But it never does. When
			the rain stops, the boulevard
			dries and the snakes once again
			slink from their holes. That's
			when my door opens and the
			helpless, the desperate, walk
			through with a heart full of hurt
			and a pocket full of nothing.
			It unearthed half-forgotten
			feelings the same way it dug up
			sleeping bones in shallow unmarked
			graves.
			It was that kind of day.
			Dixon Hill: "The Black Orchid,"
			Chapter Three.
			Very impressive, gentlemen.
			Now... Shall we?
			Hey Dix!
			How's tricks?
			Uh, she's fine... just fine.
			Wonderful! He really thinks
			you're Dixon Hill!
			Say Joe, I'd like to buy a paper
			too, but I don't have any money.
			Catch me next time, Dix.
			"Hitler on the move... Roosevelt
			presses Congress for British
			aid... DiMaggio streak reaches
			thirty-seven?"
			DiMaggio. Joltin' Joe, the
			Yankee clipper.
			Baseball. A national obsession
			at the time.
			The streak they refer to, will
			eventually reach fifty-six
			games...
			And be snapped by a pair of
			journeyman hurlers for the
			Cleveland Indians --
			Cleveland!!!
			They got no pitching! They never
			got no pitching. What are ya,
			nuts or somethin'?
			The record will stand until the
			year 2026, when a shortstop for
			the London Kings--
			Hey Dix, what gives with this guy?
			He ain't from around here, is he?
			Uh, no... he's not.
			He's from South America.
			Yeah. He's got a nice tan.
			I should have listened to her.
			She told me someone was trying
			to kill her.
			She's a page from a book, sir.
			That's all she ever was.
			Well, well, look what the cat
			dragged in.
			Cat?
			What on Earth... Where the hell
			did he come from?
			South America. Can't you tell?
			Wherever you're from, while
			you're in my town, keep your nose
			clean.
			Well, tough guy, this time you've
			really done it. Your goose is
			cooked, but good.
			I'm sorry about this, Dix.
			Don't apologize to him'
			Where were you last night between
			ten and midnight?
			That would be a bit hard to
			explain.
			Yeah? Well you'll have plenty
			of time to come up with something.
			You're goin' downtown.
			What for?
			For the murder of Jessica Bradley.
			Status report?
			We're being probed, sir.
			The Jarada.
			Most likely. But it's long
			range. Can't be certain where
			it's originating..
			One could get the feeling they
			don't exactly trust us.
			Commander, I'm receiving a
			subspace message from the Jarada.
			That's not part of the plan.
			Pipe it through.
			En-ter-prise. The time has come
			to honor us. We await your
			greeting.
			This is Commander Riker, first
			officer of the Enterprise --
			-- You are not captain?!
			No sir, I'm not. I suggest we
			commence with screen to screen
			communication so we can see each
			other --
			-- You offend us! We will not
			show ourselves to a mere
			subordinate. We await your
			captain's greeting with growing
			unrest. End of communication!
			Terrific.
			Get the captain. You'll find
			him in the Holodeck.
			Hiya Doc. What's shakin'?
			Are you alright?
			I'm just a little dizzy, thank
			you. I had some trouble coming
			through. Where's Captain Picard?
			He's on ice.
			Pardon?
			He's being grilled.
			What is he Data, a fish?
			The captain's being interrogated.
			They think he's committed a
			murder.
			Shouldn't we be doing something
			to help him?
			Relax Doctor. It's all part of
			the game. Believe me, he's having
			the time of his life in there.
			I've told you everything I know.
			Yeah? Well, you're just gonna
			have to tell us again. From the
			top.
			Very good. I've read all this
			before. It's exactly as it should
			be.
			Spill it!
			La Forge to bridge.
			Riker here.
			I can't find the captain, sir.
			I told you, he's in the Holodeck.
			Something's... gone wrong.
			What are you saying Lieutenant?
			I can't communicate with them.
			I can't access the program -- and
			I can't open the doors.
			Ship's log, supplemental. First
			officer reporting. Due to an
			unknown breakdown in the Holodeck,
			we are unable to locate the
			captain and his party...
			Tasha, take over. I'm going to
			Holdeck Three.
			Commander?... I've studied all
			the technical manuals on the
			Holodeck. I think I could be of
			some help down there.
			Geordi's well equipped to deal
			with the situation, Wes. Right
			now, your duties are on the
			bridge.
			His mother's in there too, sir.
			Come on, Wesley.
			Thank you sir.
			... And you say you'd never met
			her before she came to hire you.
			I've already told you that.
			Twice.
			Yeah? Well you're gonna tell me
			again.
			Look fellows, this is no longer
			amusing.
			Easy, Mike!
			You think you're tough, Hill!
			But you're nothing! You're
			garbage!
			Don't take him too seriously, Dix.
			His old lady's been giving him
			a hard time. You know how it is.
			I need to get out of here.
			Yeah. I'll see what I can do.
			Something on your mind?
			Yeah. But I'm not sure I can
			repeat it in mixed company.
			You're a pretty hep lookin' broad.
			Is that good?
			It ain't bad. You like Charlie
			McCarthy?
			McCarthy?... Oh, you mean the man
			who hunted Communist witches.
			I got two tickets to the show
			tomorrow night.
			Do you mind if I experiment with
			this device?
			I don't care what you do.
			Thanks, Mac.
			Who is this jerk?
			Okay Dix. We're bustin' you out
			of here.
			That's welcome news.
			You better not try to leave town.
			It's been a pleasure, sir.
			I get the feeling he doesn't like
			me.
			We know you're dealing with The
			Fat Man, Dixon. Take it from a
			friend; it doesn't help your case.
			I'll keep it in mind.
			Thank you. For helping me.
			Forget it.
			When you comin' over for supper?
			The kids'd love to see you, and
			you know how much you love
			Sharon's cooking.
			Soon, my friend. But at the
			moment I have other duties.
			Blonde or brunette?
			She's a lady all right... and her
			name's Enterprise.
			Sounds like a working girl.
			I'll stop by the office with a
			bottle of scotch. You can tell
			me all about her.
			Have a good time?
			I'm not sure. Sometimes it seemed
			too real.
			Glad you could make it.
			I must say, you wear it well.
			Why thank you, Mister Hill.
			I think it's time we got back to
			the Enterprise.
			We are on the Enterprise, Captain.
			Yes. Of course we are.
			Do we have time to see your
			office?
			I don't see why not.
			The Holodeck makes excellent use
			of a finite space.
			Ah, Mister Hill. You've been
			avoiding me.
			It's Felix Leech! It has to be.
			You know me, sir?
			Well, I've read about you. Many
			times.
			I'm sorry Mister Leech, but we
			really must be going. Call again
			tomorrow.
			You're being quite rude, Mister
			Hill. You haven't even introduced
			me to your charming companions.
			That'll have to wait.
			We have business! Urgent
			business.
			You're not going anywhere. Not
			until we have a little chat.
			Bridge to Holodeck. We're
			approaching Torona Four.
			Any word from the Jarada?
			Not a thing, sir.
			They may be testing us. Seeing
			if we'll stick to the
			arrangements.
			What do we do now, sir?
			We wait.
			Everything checks out so far.
			Ensign Crusher believes the
			trouble may have been caused by
			the Jaradan probe. If so, it
			could be very difficult to
			locate.
			I'm not a man to be toyed with,
			Mister Hill. You were hired to
			locate a certain object. I demand
			to know what you've done with it.
			I can't help you, Mister Leech.
			I'm afraid this game is over.
			I assure you, this is no game!
			Take it from me Leech, you'll
			never find it.
			Now... give me the gun.
			But... they're not real.
			This man has been shot. If we
			don't get him to Sickbay, he'll
			die.
			There's massive internal bleeding --
			How could this happen?
			It'll happen again if you don't
			cooperate.
			You struck me! How dare you!
			You'll be sorry! The Fat Man
			isn't going to like this!
			We have to get him to Sickbay!
			Exit!
			Computer! Exit!
			We'll try the other exit.
			Computer! Identify exit!
			There is a programming
			malfunction. The computer refuses
			to identify the exits.
			I'm losing his pulse!
			Computer, this is the captain!
			Identify exit!
			Standard orbit, Mister Worf.
			Aye sir, standard orbit.
			Riker to Holodeck.
			Nothing yet, Commander.
			We're running out of time.
			It's no use. It's just not here
			anymore.
			Suggestions, Mister Data?
			I am at a loss. We are in a
			Holodeck-created building of 1941.
			The computer has refused to accept
			voice commands. The controls for
			the environment are therefore not
			accessible. They are outside in
			the reality of the Holodeck.
			I could use some light.
			Good day, Mister Hill. My name
			is Cyrus Redblock. I hope you
			don't mind us dropping in.
			I see I have no choice.
			Life is an endless stream of
			choices. Unfortunately, you have
			chosen to make my life more
			difficult.
			I don't suppose you'd be foolish
			enough to hide it here.
			I don't suppose so.
			Still, I'm sure you won't mind
			if we take a look around.
			I wish you'd quit asking, since
			it's obvious you're going to do
			it anyway. It's a big waste of
			time.
			Good manners, Madam, are never
			a waste.
			Civility, gentlemen. Always
			civility.
			Get that stiff out of here.
			He's not dead.
			From his pallor, he soon will be.
			You want I should throw him in
			the garbage, boss?
			The next room will do nicely for
			now.
			Which one struck you?
			It was Hill.
			For every action, there is an
			equal and opposite reaction. A
			truism that you have sadly
			neglected.
			I saw your light and figured you
			were working late.
			Guess I was right.
			Nice company you're keeping, Dix.
			You forget to take the trash out
			this morning?
			I'm a tolerant man, but I don't
			tolerate disrespect.
			Your devotion to etiquette is
			highly admirable, sir. However,
			your methods leave much to be
			desired.
			What have we here?
			Looks like a ghost.
			Where do you suppose he's from?
			Where were you hatched, anyway?
			Central America.
			I've been all over this world and
			I must say, I've not seen anything
			like you.
			He's not from this world. None
			of us are.
			We come from a world of fabulous
			riches. A world of objects --
			far greater in value than the one
			you seek.
			That's ridiculous! You're a
			private dick. We've met before
			and you never mentioned any of
			this.
			He's right, Dix. That's pretty
			weak stuff. I can't even buy
			that line of guff.
			I am not Dixon Hill.
			He's not!
			I only look like Dixon Hill.
			He speaks the truth, sir. From
			your point of view, he is only
			a fiction, a facsimile, a
			knock-off, a cheap imitation.
			Thank you, Mister Data.
			Sorry sir, that did not come out
			quite the way I interded.
			Very good. Very, very, good.
			What wonderful fiction! Quite
			entertaining. I admire your skill
			at trying to obfuscate our sense
			of reality.
			It is you who are not real, sir.
			Data--
			It is you who are imaginary
			characters derived from a work
			of fiction.
			Give it up, fellas. These guys
			are too smart to fall for that
			story.
			I am afraid you are not real either,
			Lieutenant.
			I don't want to hear any more
			of this! You're making me crazy!
			Deep down, you all sense the
			truth. Deep down, you know you're
			not real. All of you.
			Shut up!!
			Let me shoot them, Mister
			Redblock. Let me kill them, one
			by one.
			A most interesting situation.
			Perhaps we should test this
			theory by killing one of them.
			You've already done that! This
			man is dying! This whole thing
			is senseless!
			Hardly! Senseless killing is
			immoral. But killing for a
			purpose is often ingenious.
			Well said, Mister Redblock.
			What's our purpose?
			We are on a quest for knowledge,
			Mister Leech.
			We want the item.
			We don't have it.
			Shall I kill him?
			No, kill the woman!
			Redblock. I have the item.
			At last. I knew it! God, man,
			you are a character! Waiting
			until the last moment! Testing
			my resolve! What an ally you
			would make! Now -- where is it?
			I'll explain. But first, tell
			Leech to back off.
			Put the gun down, Mister Leech.
			But I want to kill her!
			Perhaps later. It won't harm us
			to listen to Mister Hill.
			Don't make any deals with that
			slime, Dix!
			Begin. Make your thoughts
			fruitful and your words eloquent.
			Your lovely friend's life depends
			upon it.
			There is a price.
			By God, man, I knew we were of
			the same stripe. Name it.
			Mister Whalen's life. You must
			help us save him.
			What the devil --
			Probes! I'm reading several
			of them, sir. All locked on to
			us.
			Verified. Coming from the
			Jaradans!
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Frequencies open, sir.
			This is Commander Riker, aboard
			the Enterprise. We demand that
			you --
			Cut that off!
			Lieutenant La Forge to bridge.
			Riker here.
			Is everything all right, sir?
			We felt quite a surge down here
			--
			Yes. Status report.
			We think we have something, sir.
			I'll let Ensign Crusher explain.
			I've found three --
			Forget the explanation! Can you
			repair it?
			I don't know if I should. If
			this isn't done correctly, the
			program could abort and everyone
			inside could vanish.
			Do you need more time to study
			it?
			No, sir. Whether we do it now
			or later, the risk will be the
			same.
			Do it.
			If we can find the way of getting
			him to our Sickbay by fixing our
			computer --
			Computer? I do not know this
			word.
			-- A mechanical or electronic
			apparatus capable of carrying out
			repetitious and highly complex
			mathematical operations at high
			speed.
			Computers are used to control,
			perform, process, or store --
			Enough!
			Let me kill him. He's beginning
			to irritate me.
			Captain, the exit...
			That's it! The way into our
			world.
			Remarkable. Is this a two-way
			passage? Can one enter your world
			and return to this one simply by
			stepping through?
			Yes. Allow us to help Mister
			Whalen, and we'll return with
			the item.
			By God, sir, you are a scamp!
			To think that I would wait here
			--
			If you are thinking of going
			through yourself sir, I can assure
			you that is not possible.
			Not possible!
			One look at you sir, proves
			anything is possible.
			Stand back, Mister Hill. I would
			shoot you myself, but I don't want
			to rob my assistant of his
			greatest pleasure.
			Thanks, boss.
			After we've gone, kill them all.
			Make sure no one ever finds the
			bodies.
			You're insane! You think you can
			kill a cop and get away with it?
			Why not? I've done it before.
			Come, Mister Leech.
			Our destiny awaits.
			Au revoir et bon chance, mon ami!
			Another world.
			A whole new world to plunder!
			Uh-oh.
			What is it?
			Nooo!! I want to live!! I want--
			We've done it, but still no sign
			of them.
			Should we go inside?
			Pick him up. Get him to Sickbay.
			What about you?
			I'll follow you. Now go!
			I can't think of a way to thank
			you. You know I can't take you
			with me.
			Someone's gotta book this creep.
			Once a cop always a cop, I guess.
			I have to go.
			So this is the big good-bye.
			Tell me something, Dixon.
			When you've gone.... will this
			world still exist?.. Will my wife
			and kids still be waiting for me
			at home?
			I honestly don't know. Good-bye
			my friend.
			Captain!
			Are you ready, sir?
			As ready as I'll ever be. Open
			hailing frequencies.
			Frequencies open.
			This is Jean-Luc Picard, captain
			of the USS Enterprise. Aaaaard
			kraxon Leeeeesss...
			Risssssss... Trassssss.... Trasulah!
			You have... honored us with
			your words of greeting. A new
			day dawns between us.
			So... Have a nice vacation?
			It was a nice place to visit,
			but I wouldn't want to die there.
