			First officer's log, stardate
			41775.5. We are en route to the
			ocean world known as Pacifica...
			Our mission is routinely
			scientific in nature. We look
			forward to seeing the warm blue
			waters and fine white beaches that
			make Pacifica a treasured jewel
			of the galaxy.
			... So the guy staggers to his
			feet and goes back to the girl.
			She smiles, looks him right in
			the eye and says "Just try that
			in hyperspace!"
			Ah, I see. So the difficulty in
			attaining such complex
			positioning in a zero gravity
			environment, coupled with the
			adverse effect it would have on
			the psychological well being of
			the average human male, is what
			makes this anecdote so amusing.
			Yes. Very humorous indeed.
			Hysterical, in fact.
			What's our e.t.a. at Pacifica,
			Mister La Forge?
			Twenty two hours, fourteen
			minutes.
			Increase to warp six.
			Aye sir.
			Think anyone'll mind if we arrive
			a little ahead of schedule?
			I know I won't. I've been looking
			forward to a nice swim.
			You are aware Counselor, that the
			Holodeck can be programed to
			recreate an oceanic environment.
			It's just not the same, Data.
			Have you ever gone for a real
			moonlight swim?
			One can swim in moonlight?
			How about you, Worf?
			Swimming is too much like bathing.
			-- Commander Riker.
			I am receiving a Code Forty-Seven.
			Verify.
			It is a Code Forty-Seven, sir.
			Starfleet emergency frequency.
			Code Forty-Seven... Captain's eyes
			only.
			Riker on the bridge, Captain.
			I'm sorry to disturb you.
			What is it, Number One?
			An incoming message -- Code Forty
			Seven, sir.
			Pipe it through.
			This is an emergency communique.
			It is not to be discussed with
			fellow officers unless deemed
			absolutely necessary. There will
			be no computer record of said
			transmission.
			Understood.
			Proceed with voice print
			identification.
			Picard, Jean-Luc. Captain, USS
			Enterprise.
			Voice print verified.
			Walker...
			Hello, Jean-Luc. Been a long
			time.
			Too long, my friend. Why are you
			contacting me on this frequency?
			It was a difficult decision. I
			felt it was worth the risk.
			Risk?!
			It's about Starfleet... about
			something we've always considered
			to be impossible.
			I don't understand.
			I can't explain it now. We need
			to talk, face to face.
			You're using a Code Forty-Seven!
			I have to know what this is all
			about.
			Not over subspace. No.
			For God's sake Walker, you know
			this is a secure channel --
			-- No!
			I want you to meet me on Dytallix B.
			When?
			Immediately.
			Impossible. We're expected at
			Pacifica --
			-- That can wait.
			You owe me. And you owe it to
			yourself to hear what I have to
			say.
			Something's beginning... Have you
			felt it?... Creeping out of the
			woodwork...
			An infestation.
			What is?
			Don't trust anyone. Remember
			that, Jean-Luc. Don't take
			anything for granted.
			Walker --
			-- Dytallix B. We'll be waiting.
			Are you familiar with Dytallix
			B, Lieutenant?
			Uh, well...
			If I may, sir? Dytallix B is one
			of seven uninhabited worlds mined
			for the Federation by the Dytallix
			Mining Company. I believe B is
			in the nearby Mira system.
			Fine. Chart a course for it
			immediately, warp seven. And
			there will be no records or
			logs mentioning any aspect of
			this diversion.
			Captain, they're expecting us at
			Pacifica. Shouldn't we contact
			them to let them know --
			-- Negative, Will. Nothing goes
			out without specific orders from
			me.
			Hopefully our delay will be
			minimal.
			I have the readout on Dytallix
			B, Commander.
			On screen.
			Dytallix B is the fifth of six
			planets circling the red giant
			known as Mira.
			One side always faces the sun --
			where temperatures reach up to
			one hundred and eighty degrees
			Celsius. The mines line the
			temperate zone between the day
			and night sides, but they are
			long deserted.
			Why the devil would we be going
			there? Are there any miners or
			indigenous life forms on the
			planet?
			I believe the answer is negative
			to both questions, sir. In a
			manner of speaking, it is nothing
			but a lifeless hunk of rock, a
			useless ball of mud, a worthless
			chunk of --
			Thank you, Data. I get the idea.
			Captain, we're approaching
			Dytallix B.
			Very good, Number One. I'm on
			my way.
			Captain, sensors are detecting
			three Federation starships already
			in orbit around the planet.
			Identify.
			Two are frigates: the Renegade
			commanded by Tryla Scott, and the
			Thomas Paine, Captain Rixx
			commanding.
			The third is just coming into
			range now, sir... It is an
			Ambassador Class heavy cruiser...
			The USS Horatio.
			Horatio?
			Isn't that Walker Keel's ship?
			Attempts at communication have
			been ignored by all three vessels.
			You will make no further attempts,
			Mister Worf. Any life-form readings
			on the surface, Mister Data?
			Three sir. All gathered inside
			what appears to be the entrance
			to a mining tunnel.
			Very well. Relay those
			coordinates to the Transporter
			Room. I'm beaming down.
			Alone, Captain?
			Alone, Number One.
			Good to see you, Jean-Luc. Thanks
			for coming.
			This is some greeting, "old
			friend."
			Tell me Jean-Luc -- where did we
			first meet?
			Answer the question!
			On Tau Ceti III. It was a bar --
			Quite an exotic one at that.
			What do I win?
			Do you recall the night you
			introduced Jack Crusher to
			Beverly?
			You know full well I hadn't even
			met Beverly then. You introduced
			them.
			My brother introduced them.
			You don't have a brother -- two
			sisters, Anne and Melissa. Now
			what the hell's this all about?!
			Apologies, Captain. We had to
			make sure you were really you.
			Walker, what's going on?
			Captain Picard, meet Captains
			Scott and Rixx.
			I believe we've met... The
			Altairian conference?
			Tryla Scott. It's said you made
			captain faster than anyone in
			Starfleet history, present company
			included.
			Are you that good?
			Yes. I am.
			Starfleet's finest.
			Fancy meeting you here.
			We all came secretly, Picard.
			To discuss the threat.
			What threat?
			Have you noticed anything about
			Starfleet Command lately?
			Anything unusual?
			No. We've been on the outer rim
			for awhile. Haven't had much
			contact with them.
			Some of us have seen strange
			patterns emerging. Unusual orders...
			High-ranking officials backing
			irrational proposals --
			-- Starbase twelve was completely
			evacuated for two full days! No
			explanation given.
			And what about the deaths?
			Mckinney... Ryan Sipe... Onna
			Karapleedeez...
			All dead?
			A series of "accidents".
			Or so they say; it's hard to be
			certain of anything. Interfleet
			communications are at a minimum.
			But something is happening.
			And we fully expect the Enterprise
			to be targeted soon.
			Targeted for what? By whom?
			We're not sure yet.
			Dammit Jean-Luc, I tell you that
			some of Starfleet's top command
			people are changing! This could
			affect the very core of our
			organization. Officers I've known
			for years are bluffing their way
			through talk of old times!
			That's their weakness! A lack
			of memory.
			He doesn't believe us. He thinks
			we're crazy.
			You've given me nothing to believe
			in! Just vague talk of wild
			schemes. Who's behind it, and for
			what purpose? How are people
			being changed?
			I can't say exactly. But I think
			its spread to my own ship.
			My first officer hasn't been the
			same since we stopped off at
			Earth. Our medical officer says
			he's perfectly normal, but I don't
			think I trust him either.
			Walker --
			-- We know we don't have all the
			answers. All we ask is that you
			keep your eyes open.
			That's sound advice at any time,
			Captain.
			Stay in touch with us -- covertly.
			This meeting never took place as
			far as Starfleet is concerned.
			Please... I'm asking you as a
			personal favor.
			I'm glad, Jean-Luc... Glad you're
			still one of us.
			Tell Beverly... I said hello.
			And watch your back, Picard.
			It seems you're in turmoil.
			Friends... close friends, are few
			and far between. I'm a private
			man, Deanna. My Starfleet duties
			have shielded me from social
			circles. My two oldest and
			closest friends were Jack Crusher,
			may he rest in peace, and Walker
			Keel. Until various missions
			split us apart, we were almost
			inseparable.
			I trust Keel completely. If he
			felt it necessary to violate
			regulations, I know he must have
			a good reason.
			And you are about to put your
			career at risk for him.
			Isn't that what friendship's all
			about, Counselor?
			-- They illicitly used the
			emergency channel to draw you
			here. Then they asked you to keep
			secrets from your superiors.
			Effectively, to disobey Starfleet
			regulations.
			The people involved are all of
			the highest caliber. If I didn't
			believe in their loyalty, I
			wouldn't have gone this far.
			Don't you think you should tell
			the rest of the crew?
			No. I won't risk implicating
			them. Not until we have solid
			evidence that something really is
			wrong.
			Take us out of orbit, Mister La
			Forge.
			Aye, sir.
			Resume heading to Pacifica, warp
			factor eight.
			Aye sir, warp eight.
			At that speed sir, we should
			arrive nine point six three hours
			behind the original schedule.
			Very well. Data, I have an
			assignment for you. One
			especially suited to your talents.
			Computer -- this is Lieutenant
			Commander Data. Access all
			Starfleet Command orders to
			starships, starbases and colonies,
			for the past six months.
			Working.
			I understand the Horatio was in
			orbit around Dytallix. Did you
			see Walker?
			Yes. He asked me to say hello
			to you.
			I would have liked to have seen
			him --
			-- That wasn't possible, Doctor.
			Captain... I'm picking up an
			unusual disturbance in a nearby
			quadrant.
			Confirmed, sir. Sector
			sixty-three.
			Specify. What kind of
			disturbance?
			Hard to say at this distance,
			Captain.
			I suppose Pacifica can wait a
			little longer.
			Yes. Let's investigate. Maintain
			speed and alter course
			accordingly.
			Aye sir, changing course to
			three-five-one mark four.
			Approaching Sector sixty-three,
			sir.
			Slow to impulse, Mister La Forge.
			Aye sir, slowing to impulse.
			Sensors beginning to pick up small
			objects, Captain.
			On screen.
			Doesn't look natural.
			Agreed.
			Enlarge and identify.
			It looks like... debris.
			From a space vessel of some kind.
			It could be one of the ships that
			was orbiting Dytallix.
			Agreed, sir. This sector is
			in close proximity to that planet.
			Any identifying marks, Worf?
			Nothing so far... Sensors not
			detecting any bodies in the
			flotsam... but judging from the
			amount of wreckage...
			... I'm sorry sir.
			It can only be the Horatio. She's
			been totally destroyed.
			Captain's personal log, stardate
			41776.1. The death of my friend
			Walker Keel, has had a powerful
			impact on me. I now believe there
			may be a cancer growing within
			the ranks of Starfleet.
			I've decided to alert my executive
			officer to the suspicions voiced
			by Keel and the other two captains.
			There is no proof of anything.
			The last time I saw Admiral Quinn
			he tried to warn me of a subversion
			inside the Federation. Then Walker
			tried, and now he's dead.
			Subversion? Personally I don't
			believe in conspiracy theories.
			Startling. Quite extraordinary,
			in fact.
			Directions unclear. Please repeat
			request.
			That was not a request. I was
			simply... talking to myself.
			A human idiosyncrasy triggered
			by fascination with a particular
			set of facts. Or sometimes
			brought about by senility. Or,
			used as a means of weighing
			information before reaching a
			conclusion. Or, as a --
			-- Thank you, sir. I comprehend.
			Continuing with record scan.
			Intriguing.
			I do not think the explosion of
			the Horatio was an accident. It
			was sabotage.
			But we can't be certain.
			Perhaps we can.
			My orders were to search for
			abnormal patterns in Starfleet's
			directives. I believe I have
			found just that.
			These are various outposts and
			starbases where I have detected
			unusual activity over the past
			few months.
			What sort of activity?
			An uncustomary reshuffling of
			personnel, usually in the command
			areas. The new officers have had
			abnormally frequent contact with
			the highest levels of Starfleet
			Command.
			Why hasn't anybody noticed this
			before?
			The orders were given with great
			subtlety. To use an aphorism,
			Starfleet's left hand did not know
			what its right hand was doing.
			Can you speculate as to the
			purpose of these reassignments?
			I believe it is a clandestine
			attempt to control vital sectors
			of Federation territory.
			It could be a prelude to invasion.
			But who's behind it?
			There is insufficient data to make
			such an assesment.
			What do you suggest we do, warp
			over to Starfleet headquarters
			and demand to know what's going
			on?
			Why not?!
			Yes...
			... Why not indeed?
			We're talking about a threat to
			the entire future of the
			Federation. I don't think any
			of us can rest easy until we've
			gone to the source.
			Captain's personal log,
			supplemental. We have altered
			course and are traveling toward
			Earth. I have apprised the
			remaining bridge crew of our
			situation.
			Approaching Earth, sir.
			Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.
			Standard orbit, sir.
			Any word from Starfleet Command,
			Mister Data?
			Nothing so far, sir.
			Strange...
			I have a message coming in from
			Starfleet Command, Captain.
			On screen.
			Greetings Enterprise. I am
			Admiral Savar. This is Admiral
			Aaron, and I believe you know
			Admiral Quinn.
			Yes. Good to see you again,
			Admiral.
			And you, Captain.
			Of course. We are always delighted
			when the Enterprise returns to
			the nest. Yet we are puzzled by
			the timing of your visit.
			Yes sir, I can imagine you would
			be.
			Governor Delaplane of Pacifica
			informs us that you canceled your
			scheduled stop there. Is this
			true?
			It is, sir.
			Explain yourself, Captain. Why
			have you returned to Earth?
			That... is something I'd rather
			discuss in person, Admiral.
			Please excuse us a moment,
			Captain.
			They seem normal enough.
			On the surface. Any thoughts
			counselor?
			Hard to say, sir. I sense that
			someone is hiding something, but
			I can't tell who or what.
			I can't say I'm overjoyed to see
			Remmick again.
			Considering what we've done, their
			response has been pretty
			temperate.
			I don't like it, Captain. We
			can't trust --
			Forgive the delay, Captain Picard.
			We'd be delighted if you and your
			first officer would join us for
			dinner.
			Yes. Delighted.
			This should give you a good
			opportunity to expatiate your
			viewpoint.
			To elaborate upon whatever it is
			that's troubling you.
			We accept your gracious offer.
			Excellent. Preparations are
			already underway.
			We'll greet you in the reception
			area in say... twenty minutes?
			Fine.
			I, uh, won't be able to attend the
			dinner I'm afraid. But I would
			like to see the ship and say hello
			again, Captain.
			Of course. Looking forward to
			seeing you. Enterprise out.
			Quinn wants to see us alone --
			at least we know he's still on
			our side.
			Are you ready to beam up to the
			Enterprise sir?
			Yes, Commander, quite ready.
			Welcome aboard, Greg. You
			remember Commander Riker.
			Yes, hello again Commander.
			I must say, you're looking well.
			Never felt better in my life.
			Last time we met you told me how
			tired you'd been feeling.
			Tired of life, I was. But not
			anymore. I look forward to new
			challenges now.
			I'd sure like to see some more
			of the ship.
			Remember what you told me back
			at Relva 7? About the threat you
			perceived to the very fabric of
			the Federation?
			Is that why you're here? Because
			of what I said?
			That's one of the reasons.
			Jean-Luc! You took me far too
			literally. I was only referring
			to the difficulty involved in
			assimilating new races into the
			Federation.
			It's an ongoing and tumultuous
			process that can cause stress and
			strain on all aspects of our
			alliance.
			I'm sorry... I must have
			misunderstood.
			I'm the one who should be
			apologizing.
			If I led you down the garden path,
			I humbly ask forgiveness.
			Of course.
			Now gentlemen, I believe you have
			a dinner to attend, while I would
			like to freshen up a bit before
			looking around some more.
			We have a guest accommodation at
			your disposal, sir.
			Outstanding.
			I should be getting down to the
			planet. Commander Riker will be
			at your disposal to show you
			anything you'd like to see.
			That's really not necessary --
			-- I insist.
			You can join me on Earth when the
			admiral's tour is completed.
			I may want to stay a while,
			Jean-Luc.
			Of course, Admiral. Stay as long
			as you wish.
			That's not Gregory Quinn. He may
			look like him and sound like
			him... but it isn't him.
			Can you be absolutely certain,
			sir.
			I am certain, Number One. I want
			you to go back to that cabin and
			keep your eye on his every move.
			Have Beverly concoct a reason for
			a complete medical examination.
			How?
			I don't care how! Just do it!
			Use force if necessary.
			He's a senior admiral.
			It's not him, Will. I know that
			now. What we need to find out
			is how he's been duplicated.
			And who or what's behind it.
			Captain... if you're right --
			-- I am right.
			-- Should you be beaming down
			alone? Unarmed?
			I'll take care. Find out what
			you can, and then join me -- in
			force if you believe it's
			warranted.
			Energize.
			Good luck, sir.
			Welcome home, Captain Picard.
			Thank you, sir. My first officer
			will be joining us shortly.
			Yes, I'm sure he will.
			You've met Commander Remmick,
			haven't you?
			Under less than ideal
			circumstances. It is nice to see
			you again, Captain.
			I hope you have a healthy
			appetite. We've prepared a
			special meal in your honor.
			I'm honored.
			Tell me, why is it so quiet here?
			The last time I saw this corridor
			it was bustling with activity.
			It often is. Tonight's a quiet
			night.
			Yes, a quiet night.
			Let's have some Andonian tea while
			we wait for your Riker. Then you
			can tell us what's brought you here.
			I see you keep up with our duty
			roster.
			Of course, Captain. The
			Enterprise is very important to
			us.
			Ready for your tour, Admiral?
			Quite ready, Commander.
			What's in the case?
			Actually... I brought this for
			Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd
			like you to see it first?
			What is it?
			A form of life. Discovered quite
			accidentally by a survey team on
			a distant uncharted planet.
			Why haven't we heard anything
			about that?
			Oh, you'll be hearing more about
			it shortly. But first there is
			much scientific study to be done.
			After all, this is a superior lifeform.
			Superior?
			Totally.
			Now come, Riker. Take a good
			look.
			I think I'll summon our science
			officer --
			It won't like your science
			officer. It likes you.
			Now look!
			Vitamins. They do wonders for
			the body.
			Ahh, your life is so painful now.
			But soon you'll be one of us.
			Riker to Security. Emergency --
			I'd like to begin the discussion
			of why I'm here.
			In time Captain, in time. First,
			a toast.
			To the Horatio, gentlemen.
			The Horatio.
			What an awful tragedy. Such a
			terrible loss of life.
			It's interesting you mention the
			Horatio. That's one of the things
			I wanted to discuss.
			Really?
			Has the cause of her destruction
			been ascertained?
			Absolutely.
			Implosion, due to extreme
			negligence on the part of her
			captain.
			Drink up, Picard. I believe
			you'll find it an excellent
			aperitif.
			It's good that you're here. He
			slipped and hit his head.
			This is Lieutenant La Forge in
			Guest Quarter Sixteen. We have
			a possible medical emergency.
			Your Doctor Crusher is most
			capable; I'm sure he'll be all
			right. Now if you'll excuse me,
			my time here is limited...
			Come on, Klingon. It's just you
			and me now...
			Do Klingons fear death as much
			as humans? I could snap your neck
			in a second, but that wouldn't
			be as much fun.
			Are you all right?
			If I could see... I'd be seeing
			stars.
			Who... what is he?
			Let's find out.
			Retinal scans are an exact match
			... It really is Quinn!
			How can that be? He picked me
			up like a rag doll.
			I'm going to run a complete
			internal scan.
			Keep me posted, Doctor. I'll
			be on the bridge.
			What is this?
			What do you know of conspiracies,
			Captain?
			Not nearly enough I suppose.
			But that's the charming thing
			about them, isn't it? When a
			machination is real, no one knows
			about it. And when it's
			suspected, it's almost never real.
			Except of course, in the paranoid
			delusions of those who believe.
			Sorry to interrupt. Dinner is
			served.
			Wonderful! Bantering with the
			captain has given me quite an
			appetite.
			I'd like to contact my ship. To
			inform Commander Riker that we're
			ready to sit down.
			Of course, Captain. We'll wait
			for you at the table.
			Picard to Riker.
			Doctor Crusher here, Captain.
			May I speak freely?
			I suppose we have no choice.
			Where's Riker?
			He was attacked by Quinn. Or what
			We thought was Quinn.
			Specify, Doctor.
			A parasitic being has invaded his
			body. It has complete control
			over all brain functions. It
			seems to breath through a small
			"gill" protruding through the back
			of Quinn's neck. Look for this,
			Captain. I believe it will be
			visible on anyone who has been
			compromised.
			Any idea what it is or where it
			comes from?
			Negative. I've never seen
			anything like it before.
			Lieutenant Worf. If the situation
			is under control, we could use
			you on the bridge.
			It's okay. He won't be waking
			up for a long time.
			Continue, Doctor.
			By the placement of the tendrils,
			the parasite appears to stimulate
			the vicim's adrenal glands which
			generate great strength and
			resistence to --
			-- Spare me the medical details,
			Doctor. Just tell me if you can
			remove it.
			Not without killing the patient.
			You must set your phaser on kill,
			Captain. Stun has little effect --
			Doctor, one does not beam into
			Starfleet Headquarters armed.
			Your food is getting cold,
			Captain.
			About to go to dinner now, Doctor.
			Have Riker join me when he's
			available. Picard out.
			Go ahead and start, Captain. We
			don't stand on ceremony around
			here.
			Oh do eat up, Picard. Just raise
			your hand if you want seconds.
			You're not going anywhere.
			You'll be one of us soon.
			You were meant for the doctor.
			It couldn't be helped. Riker
			walked in on us unexpectedly.
			No matter. The doctor will soon
			be joining us. All in good time.
			Ah, Captain Scott. Good, the
			setting is now complete.
			You didn't really think we were
			in the dark about your intentions,
			did you?
			Patience is one of our virtues,
			Captain. Instead of going after
			you, we allowed you to come to
			us.
			More dramatic this way, don't you
			think?
			Yes... one thing both races share
			is a love of theatre. And you've
			put on a fine show.
			What exactly is your race? Where
			do you come from?
			It's not important. Let's just
			say... we've come a long way to
			join you.
			It's a perfect match. We're the
			brains and you're the brawn.
			You'll understand soon, Picard.
			Indeed. We've been moving slowly,
			cautiously, for many months now.
			Careful to cover our tracks.
			Careful not to arouse suspicion,
			until it's too late.
			And it is too late. For you, that
			is.
			Well said, brother. Picard and
			Riker control the Enterprise.
			Which means we control the
			Enterprise.
			Eat hearty, brother! Relish your
			new body!
			Aaron!
			Hold it, Aaron!
			Come on!
			Can I help you, gentlemen?
			Is there any trouble? Perhaps
			if you'd tell me what it is --
			-- Remmick!
			No, Will!
			You don't understand.
			We mean you no harm. We seek
			co-existence.
			Captain's log, stardate 41780.2.
			Admiral Quinn is expected to make
			a full recovery...
			There is no trace of the parasite
			which took control of him. We'll
			never know how many of these
			life-forms infiltrated Starfleet,
			but it seems they could not
			survive without the "mother
			creature" which had taken over
			Commander Remmick...
			... Still, the haunting question
			remains... Who were these
			beings... and will we ever have
			to face them again?
			It was Doctor Crusher's idea to
			simulate the blue splinter. We
			had to make sure it would fool
			everyone, including you.
			That it did, Number One. Rest
			assured.
			I have attempted to trace the
			message Remmick was sending. I
			believe it was aimed at an
			unexplored quadrant of our galaxy.
			Any idea what the message was,
			Data?
			Well... I believe it was a beacon.
			A beacon?
			Yes, Captain. A homing beacon...
			sent from Earth.
