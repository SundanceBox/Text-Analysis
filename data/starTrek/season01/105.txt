			Captain's log, Stardate 41294.5.
			Our destination, the Class M Beta
			Cassius planet known simply as
			Haven. It is a world...
			... so renowned for its peaceful
			beauty that some believe it to
			have mystical healing powers.
			Such a beautiful world. Legends
			say it has been known to mend
			souls and heal broken hearts.
			Legends which are totally
			unsupported by fact, Captain.
			Legends like that are the spice
			of the universe, Mister Data,
			because they have a way of
			sometimes coming true.
			They have intrinsic value
			regardless of the facts, sir?
			Facts are not everything, Mister
			Data.
			Indeed, sir.
			Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.
			Standard orbit, sir.
			Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.
			Your presence is requested in
			Transporter Room One.
			Sorry ladies. Duty calls.
			Lieutenant, you needed me?
			Yes sir. There's an object of some
			kind beaming in from Haven.
			What is it?
			We're not sure. I'm holding it
			in stasis until we can register
			its exact nature. It's listed
			as a gift for Counselor Troi.
			For Deanna? From here?
			That's what I wondered about.
			She's on her way now.
			Surface Station approval coming
			in now, Lieutenant.
			Okay, let's bring it in.
			Odd looking. Why would one of
			our people be getting a gift from
			this world?
			What's going on?
			I hold a message for Deanna Troi!
			Lwaxana Troi and the honorable
			Miller Family will soon arrive!
			The momentous day is close at
			hand! Rejoice!
			No, oh NO... !
			I don't believe this!
			Counselor, what's this all about?
			They're bonding gifts...
			... what you would call...
			wedding presents.
			Wedding presents? What wedding?
			Who's getting married?
			I am.
			I was certain it would never
			happen, Captain. The years I'd
			spend on this mission, the
			distance it has taken me away
			from home...
			As you must have heard, genetic
			bonding is a Betazoid tradition.
			But your father was human, Deanna.
			The Millers are human...
			You'd understand if you knew the
			loveliness of my world. The
			Millers and my father knew it,
			they loved Betazed so that
			they adopted the customs and
			traditions, including this one.
			Will you and your husband be
			staying with the ship, Counselor?
			No, sir.
			Then... I'll just say
			congratulations for now, Deanna.
			If you'll excuse me.
			Bill ... more than anything else
			in the world ... anything ... you
			want to be a starship captain.
			True?
			I love you, Deanna.
			I can feel that.
			I know you love me... within those
			limits.
			So almost more than anything else
			in the world, I want to honor my
			father's memory with this bonding.
			Did you hear carefully what I
			said?
			Every word.
			I'm sorry.
			Come dance at my wedding.
			I'll try.
			Message from planet Haven,
			Counselor. They wish to beam the
			Miller...
			... ah, wedding party aboard.
			I'm Jean-Luc Picard, captain of
			the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.
			Quite some starship you have
			here, captain. Look forward to
			this visit.
			Oh, yes, yes.
			You couldn't be...
			... I'm Deanna.
			Deanna darling! You probably
			don't even remember me.
			Wyatt was absolutely right,
			Victoria. She is a beauty.
			I'm Wyatt.
			Isn't this simply beautiful?
			I knew romance was still alive
			somewhere.
			I'd like you to have this. It's
			a Chameleon Rose. It changes
			color with the mood of its owner.
			It's wonderful. Thank you.
			Deanna, did you like the chest?
			Oh, yes. Especially the way It
			rolled its eyes at me.
			You see, Victoria? I told you
			she'd love it!
			I was in favor of something more
			dignified.
			Steven picked the ugliest face
			imaginable.
			It was a fine face. Full of
			character!
			Excuse me, but... when is my
			mother arriving?
			Your mother's still down on the
			planet, Deanna.
			Why?
			Er -- is there a place for my
			parents to rest, Captain?
			We're not really tired, son, and
			besides I'd like to see some of
			the ship.
			Steven, you know full well
			Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam
			aboard until we've cleared out.
			So...
			You can visit your quarters now,
			if you wish.
			See the Millers to their
			accommodations, please.
			I'll join you all later.
			A Mrs. Troi ready to beam up, sir.
			So be it.
			Wyatt seems a fine young man.
			Yes, he does... But I'm not what
			he expected.
			I don't understand.
			Neither do I... but I'm definitely
			a surprise of some sort to him.
			I should warn you. My mother's
			a bit... eccentric.
			Where is everyone?
			Hello, Mother...
			Don't say it... think it. Use your
			mind, not your mouth.
			Hello Mother.
			Deanna. Shame! What has this
			life done to you?
			Don't tell me. You're the
			captain.
			Of course. Your daughter
			explained your telepathic
			abilities.
			That wasn't telepathy, it was
			common sense. Who else would they
			send to greet me but the Captain?
			You may carry my luggage.
			Mother!
			No, no, quite all right. I'm
			indebted to your mother for
			the... the fine counselor she...
			Mother, it's quite inappropriate
			to ask the captain to...
			Yes, you do seem to be having
			difficulty. A man your age must
			work to keep himself in shape.
			I'm not going another step this
			way!
			A starship has its customs just
			as we do. Please set that down,
			Captain.
			If you're my mother's valet, then
			please valet!
			Well, so long as you insist...
			I apologize for her behavior.
			Do you realize you've embarrassed
			your captain?
			Do as she says. Anything to avoid
			a quarrel on this occasion.
			Mother -- what happened to Xelo?
			I was forced to terminate his
			employment.
			Xelo was strongly attracted to
			me -- his thoughts became truly
			pornographic.
			Passenger accommodations.
			Of course the thoughts of Wyatt's
			father toward me were almost as
			vulgar...
			Mother...
			... but he really doesn't have
			Mister Homn's imagination.
			Between that and his wife's inane
			chatter, it's a wonder I made it
			here at all. How do you like the
			Millers, Captain?
			I'm sure I'll find them as
			pleasant as...
			As for me, I've found it shocking
			how they've changed in the years
			since my husband and I knew them.
			Or perhaps, I've just grown beyond
			them. You realize of course that
			with Betazoids, our ability to
			read the thoughts of others does
			see us grow and learn much faster
			than the typical dull and plodding
			human who...
			Mother, that's enough!
			So, you're not totally out of
			practice. Good. Very good.
			We hope you'll be comfortable
			here.
			Yes, the room is adequate.
			Small, but adequate. You will
			of course adjust the temperature
			to a civilized level.
			I'll see what I can do. Now if
			you'll excuse me, I'm sure you
			two have a lot to talk about.
			Yes Captain, you may go.
			You've been slack, little one.
			Allowed your mental powers to
			rust.
			To avoid becoming confused,
			mother. Humans constantly think
			one thing but say another.
			Yes, they do, don't they. The
			poor dears. Our style of complete
			honesty frightens them.
			On that subject Mother, there is
			such a thing as too much honesty
			with humans.
			Nonsense. It sets them a good
			example. If they'd only say what
			they think instead of hiding it...
			But they're accustomed to hiding
			their thoughts...
			And I quite understand what you
			faced here. An entire shipload
			of such inconsistency could drive
			one insane.
			Darling, I'm sorry this had to
			happen. Truly I am. But Steven
			Miller tracked me down and
			reminded me of the vows we made.
			Mother... I'm having some trouble
			believing in those vows as I once
			did...
			Deanna!
			But... but I'll honor them, of
			course. I'm a Betazoid.
			And you may find Wyatt an unusual
			person. I've sensed remarkable
			depths in him.
			Message coming in from Haven, Sir.
			On screen.
			I'm Valeda Innis, First
			Electorine of Haven. Captain
			Picard?
			I'm Picard.
			Your presence honors us. And
			your timing is fortuitous,
			Captain.
			How so?
			An incoming vessel has bypassed
			our stargate, violating our law.
			It has refused all attempts at
			communication.
			Are you saying you believe it to
			be hostile?
			Failure to communicate is
			inherently hostile.
			We have no defensive capabilities
			here and our treaty specifies
			your obligations in that regard.
			Agreed. But let's hope it
			doesn't become a defense matter.
			Of course, Captain. But I'm very
			happy we can count on you.
			Come in.
			I wanted to apologize for my
			mother's behavior. I'm certain
			she was hard to bear on the trip
			over.
			Your mother's honest -- I respect
			that.
			Yes, but she never lets up.
			I'll admit, her honesty is a bit
			persistent.
			I've never heard it described
			better. But it is a Betazoid
			trait.
			I'll try to be only half as
			annoying.
			Let's see... what can I tell you
			about me? I'm a medical doctor,
			for whatever that's worth.
			"Doctor?" Where? How?
			If you're picking up my thoughts,
			you'd know. Can't you do that
			at all?
			Yes... This could be what mother
			felt about you. I believe we could
			read each other eventually.
			Can I take that as a compliment?
			Absolutely. I've only felt this
			with... well, with someone who's
			on this ship.
			Oh? Do I have competition?
			No. All he wants is to captain
			a starship.
			What I want is to... well, to do
			another kind of brave and noble
			thing... which you may find
			prosaic. What I want is to cure
			people.
			Well, since I am a practicing
			psychologist, maybe we can work
			in concert. We are going to be
			together a long time.
			Yes. That's the point of
			marriage, I suppose.
			I really thought you'd tell me
			you were an artist.
			I just felt your mind very much
			on those. And they are your work,
			aren't they?
			Yes.
			And I can see it'll be very hard
			to keep secrets from you.
			This is why you were surprised
			when you first saw me.
			This woman... you thought that
			I would be this woman.
			I've seen this face since I was
			a boy. When I closed my eyes at
			night, I could hear her whispering
			my name.
			Knowing you were Betazoid, I
			assumed it was you, projecting
			yourself into my mind.
			I'm sorry I'm not what you hoped
			for...
			No. Please don't mistake a
			childish fantasy for
			disappointment. You're so
			beautiful, I-- I feel honored.
			You have no idea who she is?
			No. And it really doesn't matter
			now.
			Captain's personal log. I trust
			my concern over the problems of
			ship's Counselor Troi are not
			based merely on the fact of losing
			a highly valuable crew member.
			Actually...
			... it seems to me that she has
			become trapped by a custom of her
			home world which the facts of the
			twenty-fourth century have made
			unwise and unworkable. I wish
			I could intervene.
			On the viewer, Captain...
			Unidentified vessel. Traveling
			sub-warp speed, bearing two-three-
			five, mark seven.
			Sub-warp? It's several hours
			away then?
			Let's take a look at it. Enlarge
			to maximum.
			Increasing magnification, sir.
			Mister Data! Am I seeing the
			trouble I believe is there?
			If you mean a Tarellian vessel,
			you are, sir.
			I thought the Tarellians were
			finished! What are the poor
			devils doing here?
			Doctor Crusher to the Bridge,
			urgent!
			There's no way I'll permit them
			to destroy us. And the treaty
			here forces us to protect this
			world too.
			Captain's log, supplemental. It
			has been believed the Tarellian
			race was extinct, an assumption
			contradicted now by the sight of
			one of their vessels...
			... approaching Haven.
			The fact it is traveling at its
			present velocity suggests an
			answer.
			A damaged vessel, sir? That could
			explain it.
			If it were unable to reach warp
			speed, it would have taken all
			these years to get here.
			Continue with the briefing, Mister
			Data.
			Class M world, much like your
			Earth world, very similar humanoid
			life form, which faced the
			unfortunate old story of their
			hatreds outrunning their
			intelligence.
			Hostilites between the two land
			masses?
			Ending with one of them... it
			doesn't really matter
			which... unleashing a deadly
			biological weapon on the other.
			And naturally the other also
			became infected in the end...
			It makes one question the
			intelligence of humanoid forms.
			Are you acquainted with the facts
			of the infection, Doctor?
			They had reached Earth's
			late-twentieth century, early
			twenty-first century level. Which
			was all that's needed if you're
			a damned fool. A highly deadly,
			extra-infectious virus... which
			at that modest level of knowledge,
			is not that difficult to grow.
			We learned the rest of the story
			in security training. Some
			Tarellians made it to other worlds
			only to die along with the
			populations they infected.
			It's pretty well covered in
			Academy training now, Captain.
			Many of them tried to avoid other
			inhabited worlds as they
			escaped... only to be hunted down
			and destroyed anyway.
			Unfortunately, we had believed
			the last Tarellian vessel was
			destroyed eight years ago by the
			Alcyones.
			Exactly when will they reach
			Haven?
			Exactly thirteen hours, nine
			minutes, twenty-one...
			Which will create a very difficult
			problem for the Enterprise at that
			time. Our treaty here requires
			us to protect Haven from alien
			threats ... and a plague ship
			certainly qualifies as that. But
			Federation policy requires us to
			assist life forms in need ... which
			qualifies the Tarellians too.
			I'll want you to help me find some
			answers by then.
			All of which gives ample time for
			your second assignment. Or you
			may prefer it on a volunteer
			basis.
			The pre-joining dinner of
			Counselor Deanna Troi will proceed
			as planned.
			We've talked it over, Captain.
			We'd like you to perform the
			ceremony.
			I'd be honored, Mrs. Miller.
			Impossible. The captain is not
			practiced in the ways of Betazed
			joining.
			This will be a traditional Earth
			ceremony!
			I'm sorry, but it proceeds out
			of a Betazed bonding.
			And I am sorry, Lwaxana, but my
			family and I are living on Earth
			now...
			So that's why you want that
			barbaric ritual.
			Terrible, Captain, to see a woman
			go downhill like this...
			Mother!
			Downhill?!
			The human ritual is out of the
			question!
			Who are you to tell us what's
			out of the question?
			Your ignorance is astonishing.
			I am Lwaxana Troi: Daughter of
			The Fifth House, Holder of the
			Sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to
			the Holy Rings of Betazed.
			Who are you?
			Excuse me, everyone, but dinner
			is served...
			... and by Starfleet tradition,
			all disputes and disagreements
			are thereby resolved.
			In who's favor?
			The captain's.
			That's not what you're thinking.
			Captains are not required to
			think.
			A toast. To the young couple and
			their families. May this union
			be a happy and productive one.
			Is it true, Captain -- that
			there's a Tarellian ship, headed
			for Haven?
			Yes, it's true.
			That's amazing! I've read
			everything I could about them.
			Biological virus analysis was a
			favorite subject at medical
			school.
			In which case, I'd very much like
			to meet with you, sir. I'm
			pleased to have a medical
			colleague aboard.
			Yes, ma'am... Uh, Doctor? Would
			it be possible to prepare some
			medical supplies, geared toward
			the Tarellian's probable needs?
			We could beam it over without any
			fear of infection.
			What do you think, Doctor?
			I think it's a considerate idea.
			Sickbay's at your disposal,
			Doctor.
			Thank you.
			Must you do that?
			As you well know, it is the
			Betazed way of giving thanks for
			the food we eat.
			You? Giving thanks? Besides, you
			never did this before.
			I do it now. Unlike some people,
			I am in growth.
			Victoria, I've forgotten whether
			you enjoy pets or not.
			Love them, of course.
			Gently... gently!
			I thought you said you enjoyed
			pets.
			Captain... If I may be excused...
			... to spend some time considering
			the Tarellian situation...
			Of course.
			Ladies and Gentlemen.
			Why didn't he mention you?
			Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested
			in the Betazed ceremony you
			mentioned. Could you tell us
			more?
			I'd be delighted, Commander. It
			is an ancient ceremony, widely
			regarded as the most beautiful
			in the universe.
			After the young couple remove
			their clothing --
			The Bride and Groom go naked?!
			No. You misunderstand.
			All guests must go unclothed.
			This honors the act of love being
			celebrated...
			Don't worry too much, dear. Your
			body's not that bad.
			Besides, your husband quite likes
			the idea of seeing me unclothed.
			Steven!!
			You did know he's attracted to
			me, didn't you?
			Untrue! I don't.... Not really...
			Stop it, all of you --
			Especially you!
			Captain, as you requested, I have
			carefully avoided disagreements
			during this. But did you wish
			me to ignore what my senses tell
			me?
			Could you please continue your
			bickering? I find it intriguing.
			Why did you order up a desert?
			It matches my mood. Empty.
			Yes. It does.
			I lost you once before, and now
			I've lost you again.
			Are you certain exactly who lost
			who, Imzadi?
			Don't use that word now, Deanna...
			It means 'my beloved.'
			It also suggests the same feeling
			will go on ... tomorrow, and
			tomorrow...
			It suggests a kind of bonding ... an
			agreement...
			As I said ... I understand.
			Do you? Really?
			Imzadi... yes, you are my beloved.
			Today. But I can't lie to you
			and say I'm certain about tomorrow
			... and tomorrow ... I can't
			guarantee it will be something
			you can share.
			Because you are my Imzadi, I
			refuse to promise you a future
			I can't yet see.
			How... would an Earth woman react
			to that, Bill?
			To an Earth woman, I'd lie.
			But you'd know it if I did.
			Hello you two!
			Next!
			This is incredible. I've heard
			about this, but I never
			imagined...
			I respected what you did
			tonight...
			I lost my temper.
			It worked. You shamed them into
			compromise. After you left it
			really calmed down.
			The Joining will be half-Betazed,
			half-Old Earth. The Captain'll
			do the ceremony and Mister Homn
			will be my best man.
			And we'll take our clothes half
			off?
			Some of us all. You do... I
			do... Your mother, my father.
			But not my mother.
			How did you manage that?
			I didn't. Your mother did.
			And I just caught my father,
			practicing naked in front of his
			mirror.
			And so... A question I should have
			asked before.
			Deanna... do you really want to
			go through with this?
			Yes. I want to.
			I'm a very lucky man.
			Captain's log, supplemental. All
			attempts at warning off the
			Tarellian ship have failed. They
			still refuse to communicate and
			I am growing concerned.
			How can you be certain they're
			receiving us?
			Because our sensors are showing
			a responder echo, sir, on the
			frequency they once used.
			Message coming in from Haven.
			Viewer on.
			Captain, the plague ship is
			approaching transport range.
			We're aware of that, Electorine.
			You realize they can turn this
			lovely world of ours into a
			graveyard? Please take action,
			now, before it's too late.
			We'll take action in a few
			moments.
			Please... please destroy them now!
			We will not fire on them,
			Electorine.
			I'm certain I could disable their
			ship with a phaser burst, Captain.
			And then?
			Almost complete, Doctor.
			You show a remarkable knowledge
			of viral immunology, Wyatt.
			It's a striking design, don't you
			think?
			They built it underwater. At a
			base, three miles below sea-level.
			Oh? How did you know that?
			I don't know... I must have heard
			it somewhere.
			They're coming within transporter
			range, sir.
			Can't delay any longer, then.
			Ready the tractor beam, Lieutenant
			Yar. Target ship and activate
			on my command.
			Tractor beam ready.
			Let's hope it buys some
			communication.
			Engage.
			Got them, sir...
			Do we have them securely, Worf?
			Can they beam out to the planet?
			Negative, sir. They can't leave
			that ship.
			I know they're receiving us, sir.
			And at this distance they could
			reply with their running lights
			if necessary.
			Unless they have all died. Their
			ship could have been brought in
			by automation.
			Captain! The viewer... !
			It's the woman in Wyatt's
			painting!
			Captain's log, Stardate 41294.7
			orbiting Haven with the Tarellian
			vessel locked in our tractor beam.
			Question: What strange
			combination...
			... of circumstances has caused
			a woman out of someone's
			imagination to appear on the
			plague ship?
			Enterprise to Tarellian vessel,
			are you receiving us?
			My name is Wrenn... and before
			I inquire why you've trapped us
			here, is there one aboard your
			vessel named Wyatt?
			Your business is with me, sir.
			I am Captain Picard, commanding
			this starship.
			Captain, I don't understand...
			I can't believe this! Ariana was
			right!
			He is there, daughter!
			Wyatt, you've come to us. Just
			as you promised.
			What's happening? Except for
			dream images, I've never seen her.
			I'm not sure but perhaps mother
			would...
			Our first order of business,
			sir, is with the threat your
			vessel poses to the planet below.
			If you still carry the infection
			which destroyed your world...
			Oh, we still carry it, Captain.
			My daughter, I, all eight of us.
			Eight?
			All of us that are left, Captain.
			Most of the rest passed on during
			the years it took to reach Haven.
			Sir... if you've come here because
			of the legend about planet Haven
			miraculously healing the sick...
			No, no. We've learned to face
			the truth about such things. But
			Haven is a remarkably lovely and
			pleasant place, is it not? All
			we want is a resting place until
			the last of us are gone.
			I'm... sorry, but circumstances
			make it impossible for us to allow
			you to beam down to Haven.
			We do not ask to make contact with
			those living below. All we ask
			is to be on the edge of some sea,
			some unpopulated island or faraway
			peninsula...
			This is not our planet, sir. I'll
			be happy to present your needs
			to those who govern this world...
			Present the fact we intend to die
			here, Captain. And if we die
			while caged by your tractor beam,
			so be it.
			Isn't this combination exciting?
			But I can't wear it, of course,
			since your father would be
			devastated if I weren't naked.
			Mrs. Troi, may I talk to you about
			something serious?
			I am always serious, dear boy.
			Only my pleasant nature makes it
			appear otherwise.
			Please, Mrs. Troi.
			Yes, that was puzzling. A woman
			out of another place who insists
			she knows you.
			And...
			And whom you've dreamed of for
			all these years.
			And I hoped that with you handling
			thoughts the way you do...
			Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily
			your thoughts come through. I
			wonder if it is because you were
			raised on Betazed?
			Well, no matter, I can see you
			were wrong for my daughter anyway.
			Ma'am?
			The answer to the puzzle of Ariana
			and you is too simple for most
			humans to understand.
			Too simple?
			Of course. It's something they
			all know instinctively but go
			to great effort to reject or to
			build complicated superstitions
			about it. All life, Wyatt, all
			consciousness, wherever or
			whenever it occurs... is
			indissolvably bound together.
			Indeed, it is all part of the same
			thing.
			Yes! I have wondered if something
			like that...
			... weren't so. And no doubt so
			has Ariana, which helped the two
			of you to make contact.
			Shall I wear the light or deep
			ruby stones? Which would be best
			for me, naked?
			Wyatt, don't puzzle on it so much!
			It was just a simple thought!
			Wyatt, are you feeling all right?
			The supplies are ready. I'll take
			them to the transporter room.
			I'll notify the captain they're
			ready.
			Look at your father, Wyatt. He
			just can't wait to strip off his
			clothes in that barbaric ceremony.
			We had to compromise. As usual,
			I'm making the sacrifice.
			You look beautiful.
			But you looked best of all in
			the desert on the Holodeck.
			When you did this...
			You can put the supplies on the
			pad.
			Doctor Crusher had me set the
			coordinates. All we need is the
			captain's order --
			Captain! Someone's transporting
			to the Tarellian ship.
			Override!
			I can't sir. It's too late.
			Hello, Wyatt. We always thought
			you were a dream.
			You're not surprised. Did you
			know I'd beam over?
			Once we saw you were real, we
			knew. You are a doctor?
			Yes.
			I've brought medicines and
			supplies. I'll do what I can to
			help.
			And I knew you'd be this brave.
			How could you let this happen?
			My son, surrounded by those
			horrible lepers!
			Mrs. Miller, if I could have
			prevented this...
			Then beam him back!
			He can never come back, Mrs.
			Miller.
			You may turn off your tractor
			beam, Captain. We will not be
			going to Haven.
			Wyatt!
			Mother...Father... Forgive me,
			but I must... I'm going to try
			to cure these people.
			And Wyatt will do it. I've
			believed that all along.
			I knew I was coming to Haven to
			meet my destiny. I thought it was
			to be with you, Deanna. But it
			was Ariana who drew me here. I'm
			sorry.
			Wyatt, I'm happy for you. Ariana,
			I love you both.
			You've done surprisingly well for
			a human, Wyatt.
			Mother...
			I take that as a compliment,
			Deanna.
			My respects, Captain.
			And mine, sir.
			Good-bye.
			Keep the chest. You'll have use
			for it some day.
			Seems such a shame to waste that
			lovely wedding dress. Perhaps I
			should stay and be Joined to a
			new mate.
			What??
			The captain is highly attracted
			to me, but he's a little too old.
			Perhaps I should choose you.
			He has other obligations, Mother!
			-- Very well. It's his loss.
			Mister Homn!
			Thank you for the drinks.
			Try and remember your heritage,
			little one.
			You may energize.
			Captain! Even Xelo never had such
			thoughts about me.
			That was meant as a joke, Captain.
			But she has claimed to be so
			completely honest.
			Except when a lie is more amusing.
			Weren't you amused?
			I was not!
			Take us out of here, Mister Riker.
			Aye, sir.
			Warp two, helm, heading five-seven
			mark three-one-nine.
			Warp two, five-seven mark
			three-one-nine.
			Engage!
