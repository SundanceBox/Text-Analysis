			Include a burn unit with each
			kit. On arrival, identify the
			most critically injured and
			beam them up to Cargo Bay Six...
			Doctor Crusher, this is the
			Captain.
			Doctor Crusher here.
			Additional information. The
			number of colonists at the site
			is five hundred-four - including
			thirty-eight children.
			So far nothing more than the
			initial message. Explosion -
			cause unknown - many injured.
			Are you prepared, Doctor?
			We believe so, sir.
			Captain, we are now at warp nine
			point one.
			Which will bring us into the
			Quadra Sigma System in three
			point two hours.
			Captain, I have a schematic of
			the explosion site. It suggests
			the cause as a methane-like gas
			seeping in underground...
			Captain, I am...
			I am sensing what we encountered
			months ago...
			The "Q" Entity, sir? It is
			identical to the grid we
			encountered when...
			It reads solid, sir. If we hit
			it... !
			Not now, damn it, "Q"...
			Emergency full stop!
			Yes, sir.
			Shields and deflectors, up, sir.
			Now reading full stop, sir.
			Humans, I thought by now you
			would have scampered back to your
			own little star system.
			If this is "Q" I'm addressing,
			our vessel and crew are on a
			mission of rescue where a group
			of badly injured...
			We of the "Q" have studied our
			recent contact with you... and
			are impressed. We have much to
			discuss, including perhaps the
			realization of your most
			impossible dreams.
			However intriguing we may find
			that to be, we are now in the
			midst of an urgent journey. Once
			we have completed that...
			You will abandon that mission,
			Captain. My business with you
			takes precedence!
			If my magnificence blinds you,
			then perhaps something more
			familiar...
			Damn, the phasers are useless!
			"Q", STOP THIS!
			Stop this and we agree to talk
			for a moment!
			Starfleet Admiral "Q" at your
			service!
			You are not a Starfleet admiral,
			"Q"...
			Neither am I an Aldebaran serpent,
			Captain. But you accepted me as
			such.
			He's got us there, Captain.
			The redoubtable Commander Riker
			whom I noticed before. You seem
			to find this amusing.
			I might, if we weren't trying
			to rescue a group of suffering
			and dying humans who...
			Your species is always suffering
			and dying...
			No, Lieutenant Worf... !
			You'll make no move against him
			unless I order it.
			Pity. You might have learned
			an interesting lesson. Tsk, a
			macro head, a micro brain.
			"Q", you said you had the
			realization of "some impossible
			dreams" to offer us. Once this
			rescue is complete, I'll listen
			seriously to whatever proposal
			you wish to make and then, subject
			to it being acceptable...
			"... subject to" your foolish
			human values? Picard, why do
			you people distrust me so?
			Sir, if...
			Yes, Captain, it is best they
			don't answer that. But you... you,
			Picard, I grant the freedom to
			answer me honestly. Why do you
			distrust me so?
			"Q", right now humans may be
			dying because you...
			SPEAK! Why do you distrust me?
			Why? On our first meeting, "Q",
			you seized my vessel, condemned
			all humans as savages and on that
			charge, you tried us in a
			post-atomic twenty-first century
			court of horrors where you
			attacked my people... then you
			again seized my vessel...
			How that angers you: "Seized my
			vessel, seized my vessel... "
			... and then proceeded to interfere
			with our Farpoint mission,
			threatening to convict us as
			ignorant savages if, in dealing
			with complex and powerful
			life-forms, we made the slightest
			error... and when you failed even
			there...
			At that point, the "Q" became
			interested in you.
			Cannot some of you understand your
			incredible good fortune?!
			"Seized my vessel, seized my
			vessel... " The complaint of a
			closed mind too accustomed to
			military privileges.
			But you, Riker, and I remember
			you well, what do you make of my
			offer?
			I stand with my Captain.
			Of course, you do. Commendable
			loyalty.
			And what of these others? Since
			humanity now interests us, how
			shall we come to know them better?
			We don't have time for these
			games.
			Ah, yes! A game... for interest's
			sake, a deadly game. To the game!
			Obviously a Class-M world, gravity
			and oxygen within our limits...
			... but a twin sun? Where are
			we?
			Considering the power
			demonstrated by "Q" the last
			time... Anywhere! Assuming this
			place even exists.
			But this won't be boring. If
			"Q"'s anything, he's imaginative.
			Apparently the captain wasn't
			meant to be with us here.
			Sir! Over here... !
			Join me, Riker. A good game
			needs rules and planning...
			Wasn't it your own Hartley who
			said "Nothing reveals humanity
			so well as the games it plays?"
			Almost right. Actually, you
			reveal yourselves best in how you
			play.
			Sir, what he has in mind could
			provide us with vital information.
			What I sense is... pleasure, sir.
			Incredible. I was just thinking
			of an old-fashioned lemonade...
			... and so it became that. An
			excellent thirst quencher; it
			becomes quite hot out on this
			plane.
			What about my people?
			Whatever they want, of course!
			The rigid Klingon code! Drink
			not with thine enemy!
			Which explains something of why
			you defeated them.
			Still arguing the human past?
			Perhaps you're not that original.
			Au contraire! It is the human
			future that now intrigues us... and
			should concern you most. Of all
			species, yours cannot abide
			stagnation... change is at the
			heart of what you are. But
			change into what? That's the
			question!
			That is what humans call a truism.
			Meaning "hardly original"...
			You're the one who said it. And
			while we're at it...
			... this isn't part of any human
			future...
			True, I borrowed this from your
			stodgy captain's mind. It is
			dressing for the game we will play
			and games require boundaries,
			dangers, rewards, familiar
			settings, that sort of thing.
			It's not that familiar to me...
			Data?
			It is from Europe's Napoleonic
			Era, sir, late eighteenth, early
			nineteenth centuries. This is
			a campaign headquarters tent, his
			uniform is that of a French Army
			marshal, the...
			And a marshal outranks even an
			admiral...
			Would I go from a Starfleet
			admiral to anything less?
			Of course, you wouldn't.
			But Napoleonic equipment on an
			alien planet with dual suns... ?
			As you've said, I'm nothing if
			not imaginative. And the game
			should reflect that. Shall it
			be a test of strength?
			Meaningless, since you have none.
			A test of intelligence? Equally
			meaningless...
			A game needs risk... Something
			to win; something to lose.
			If we must play a game, what would
			we win?
			The greatest possible future you
			can imagine!
			Which, of course, requires
			something totally disastrous if
			you lose!
			The point of this game will be
			whether any of you can stay
			alive.
			If your "game" is fair, we will.
			For shame, Lieutenant Worf.
			Fairness is a human concept.
			Think imaginatively! It will,
			in fact, be completely unfair...
			You've gone too far.
			Game penalty!
			Where is she, "Q"? You can forget
			your game if...
			To use a twentieth century term,
			Commander, she's in a... a "penalty
			box." Where she can remain
			unharmed unless one of you merits
			a penalty.
			Unfortunately, there is only one
			penalty box. If any of you should
			be sent there... dear Tasha must
			give up the box to you.
			And... where does she go?
			Into "nothingness."
			I entreat you to carefully obey
			the rules of the game. The only
			one who can destroy your Tasha
			now... is you.
			Turbolift Control, do you read?
			This is the captain.
			Engineering, this is the bridge.
			Security -- this is the Captain.
			Computer?
			Computer on!
			Captain's log...
			Damn... I can't even make a log
			entry.
			I wish I could help you, Captain.
			What... what are you doing here?
			I... well, this sounds strange,
			but... I'm in the penalty box.
			You're what?!
			In "Q"'s penalty box. As I said,
			it sounds strange but it
			definitely isn't. Somehow I know
			that one more penalty... by me or
			anyone... and I'm gone.
			Gone?
			Please do not keep reminding
			me...
			I'm sorry...
			No, I'm sorry. It's so
			frustrating to be controlled like
			this...
			Lieutenant...Tasha... it's all
			right...
			What the hell am I doing? Crying?
			Don't worry. There's a new ship's
			standing order.
			When in a penalty box, some tears
			are permitted.
			Captain... if you weren't a
			captain...
			Consorting with lower rank
			females, Captain?
			Destructive to discipline, they
			say. But you are, after all, only
			human, eh?
			A marshal of France? Ridiculous!
			One takes what jobs he can get.
			For example, your log entries.
			Starship log, stardate today...
			This is "Q", speaking for Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard, who we consider
			too bound by Starfleet custom and
			tradition to be useful in this
			activity.
			But who proved himself a
			resourceful opponent when he
			defeated you at Farpoint.
			The Enterprise is now helpless,
			stuck like an Earth insect in
			amber while its bridge crew plays
			out a game whose real intent...
			... is to test if their first
			officer is worthy of the greatest
			gift the "Q" can offer.
			So, you're taking on Riker this
			time.
			Excellent! He'll defeat you just
			as I did!
			A wager on that, Captain? Your
			command of this starship
			against... ?
			Against your staying out of
			humanity's path... forever! Done?
			Done!
			And you've already lost, Picard.
			You see, Riker is to be offered
			something impossible to reject.
			Geordi, can you still see Worf?
			I'd see the freckles on his nose,
			if he had them, sir. He's at the
			third ridge now...
			The third ridge... ?
			Moving well.
			Oh, oh!
			Good, he sees them. They look
			like sentries, sir.
			"Q", listen to me. You seem to
			have some need of humans...
			Or concern regarding them.
			Whichever it is, why try to solve
			it through this confrontation
			with us? Why not a simple direct
			explanation, a statement of what
			you seek? Why these games?
			I'm surprised you have to ask when
			your human Shakespeare has
			already explained it so well.
			Indeed he did, "Q". But careful
			you don't depend too much on any
			single viewpoint he...
			Why these games I require of you?
			A pity you're not familiar with
			the contents of your own library.
			Hear this, Picard, and reflect.
			"All the galaxy's a stage, and... "
			"All the galaxy?" "All the
			world's a stage... "
			Oh, you know that one? Then how
			about, "... Life's but a walking
			shadow, a poor player that struts
			and frets his hour upon the stage,
			and then is heard no more. It
			is a tale told by an idiot, full
			of sound and fury, signifying
			nothing."
			And so you say, how we respond
			to a game tells you more about
			us than our real life, a "tale
			told by an idiot."
			Interesting, "Q".
			Shall I quote from Hamlet?
			No. I know Hamlet. And what
			he said with irony I prefer to
			say with conviction.
			"What a piece of work is man!
			How noble in reason! How infinite
			in faculty. In form, in moving,
			how express and admirable. In
			action, how like an angel. In
			apprehension, how like a god... "
			You don't really see your species
			like that?!
			I see us one day becoming that,
			"Q". Is that what concerns you?
			Can you still see Worf?
			It's hard to keep him in sight,
			sir. But the soldiers there...
			they've formed a "skirmishing
			line," I think you'd call it... and
			they're headed this way.
			Carrying ancient powder and ball
			muskets?
			That's what their weapons look
			like, sir.
			Muskets are appropriate to the
			1790 - 1800 French army uniform.
			But it is hardly a "weapon" by our
			standards, sir. A lead ball
			propelled by gunpowder -- one-hundred
			meters at most with any accuracy...
			Against phasers? Just one of our
			hand phasers could finish off
			an entire regiment of them.
			Except for one thing...
			That hardly sounds like "Q",
			giving us an advantage like that.
			Unless...
			DROP YOUR WEAPONS!
			I'm afraid it was me, Worf.
			Making certain our phasers still
			operate.
			A warrior's reaction.
			Incredible, Worf! You came out
			of nowhere!
			Report. What did you find?
			Sir... what they're wearing may
			be old Earth uniforms, but what's
			inside those uniforms isn't human
			at all. More like vicious animal
			things.
			Oh, oh! Good old "Q". But how
			can even the most savage animal
			forms threaten us if they're armed
			with the equivalent of popguns?
			They're moving in fast, sir.
			Data, if you've got a theory on
			what's happening...
			Think fast, Commander Riker.
			And move fast... !
			That's no "musket!"
			Troi, Geordi, Worf... !
			You have only one chance to save
			them, now. Send them to your
			ship!
			You'll let me beam them?
			Send them the same way as I do.
			I've given you that power.
			Do you understand? I've given
			you the power of the "Q".
			Use it!
			Use your power!
			Take the Conn, Lieutenant.
			Engineering -- this is the bridge.
			Engineering here, sir.
			Are all systems back on line?
			Back on line, sir? They were
			never off.
			Captain, you had better look at
			this.
			There has been no interruption
			in course or speed. Both have
			remained constant. Captain -- it's
			as though we never stopped.
			We never did. "Q" suspended time.
			Where's Commander Riker?
			He was with us.
			He must still be on the planet.
			We were under attack by... by
			animal things...
			Animal things?
			Animal things in uniform, sir...
			Which I think Data could probably
			explain better, sir.
			You may find it aesthetically
			displeasing, sir. I could just
			file a computer report on that...
			Sir, the important thing right
			now is why is Commander Riker
			missing?
			Understood, Counselor, but Will
			is almost certainly safe...
			... at least "safe" in a physical
			sense. "Q" has an interest in
			him... in fact, "Q"'s entire visit
			has something to do with our
			first officer.
			And the reason for that, sir... ?
			I wish I knew. "Q" became
			interested in him at Farpoint.
			I've no idea what it means.
			Meanwhile, we must proceed with our
			rescue mission...
			Something amuses you?
			Perhaps you would share the joke
			with me?
			The joke is you, you silly son
			of a bitch.
			Strange gratitude from one who
			has been granted a gift beyond
			any human dream. How can you not
			appreciate being able to send your
			friends back to their ship...
			... or sending the soldiers back to
			the "nothingness" from which they
			came?
			Certainly, you understand that
			at this moment you can send
			yourself back to your ship... or
			to Earth, or change your shape
			and become anything else you
			want to be...
			What do you need, "Q"?
			"Need?"
			You want something from us, "Q".
			Desperately! What is it?
			Want something from you foolish,
			fragile, non-entities? Careful,
			Riker, you're beginning to sound
			like your captain.
			Now that's a compliment, "Q".
			But it's not an answer.
			Riker... we have tried to offer
			you a gift beyond all other
			gifts... !
			... Out of the "goodness" of your
			heart?
			After Farpoint, I returned to
			where we exist... the "Q
			Continuum."
			Which means exactly what?
			The limitless dimensions of the
			galaxy in which we exist. We
			could hardly be capable of acting
			in ways that seem so astonishing
			to you... if we were limited to
			the primitive dimensions in which
			you live, dimensions which would
			make us prisoners of time and
			space.
			What do you mean by we?
			In our Continuum the terms we
			and I mean much the same.
			I don't understand...
			Of course you don't, and you never
			will until you become one of us.
			Until?... Would you mind going
			over that again?
			If you'll stop interrupting me.
			This really isn't the time to
			teach you the true nature of the
			universe.
			At Farpoint, we saw you as savages
			only, and thought to frighten you
			into scurrying back to your
			system. We discovered instead,
			that you are an unusual creature
			in your own limited ways... ways
			which in time may not be so
			limited.
			We're growing. Something about
			us compels us to learn,
			explore...
			The human compulsion. And,
			unfortunately, for us, a force
			that will grow stronger century
			after century, eon after eon...
			Eons! Have you any idea how far
			we'll advance?
			Perhaps in a future you cannot
			yet conceive... even beyond us.
			And so, we must know more about
			the human condition. We have
			selected you, Riker, to become
			part of the "Q"... to bring that
			human need and hunger to us so
			that we may understand it.
			I... suppose you mean that as a
			compliment, "Q"... or maybe it's
			my limited mind...
			... but... to become part of you?!
			I don't even like you!
			You're going to miss me!
			Oh, no!
			Come on, not again!
			What's happening, Commander Riker?
			I was sitting in school...
			My phaser's gone. Worf, are you
			armed?
			Where is "Q"? If you have any
			answer to this, Number One...
			Worf!
			NO! DAMN IT, DAMN IT TO HELL... !
			Riker, you... you did that?!
			And that's not all!!
			That grid, their wounds... only
			the "Q" could do that...
			Captain's log, stardate 41591.4.
			Twelve minutes out from Quadra
			Sigma III where the survivors of
			an underground disaster
			desperately need our help. Aboard
			the Enterprise...
			... First Officer William T. Riker
			needs help nearly as badly. But
			this is a subject so far out of
			my experience... out of any human's
			experience.
			Will, how the hell do I advise
			you what to do?!
			No one has ever offered to
			turn you into "God?"
			Don't joke with me! What the
			"Q" has offered you has got to
			be close to "immortality," Will.
			They're not lying about
			controlling space and time; we've
			seen it in what they can do.
			But...
			You've also seen it in what I can
			do.
			Of all things, that troubles me
			most, Will. Are you strong enough
			to refuse to use that power?
			Certainly!
			No matter how tempted? No matter
			how difficult "Q" makes it?
			You have my word.
			In orbit of Quadra Sigma III, sir.
			Ready to beam down rescue team
			to underground emergency area.
			This way.
			You are going to be all right,
			now.
			Where are the others?
			Gone. It's just us.
			Commander!
			There's someone there!
			She's dead. If we'd only gotten
			here a little sooner... !
			Sir, if you indeed have "Q"'s
			power...
			I don't understand. Can you
			bring her back to life?
			No!
			As soon as it's convenient
			Captain, I insist on a meeting
			with you and your staff.
			As soon as we are secure from the
			rescue operation, we'll meet in
			the Conference Room.
			Thank you.
			Counselor?
			Power -- immense. Frightening.
			I can't read the intent -- but
			there is terrible anger in him.
			We'll confer on the bridge here
			if no one...
			The bridge is fine since I've
			called the entire staff...
			Correction, Number One; knowing
			the decision you face, I've
			permitted you this gathering.
			Of course, Jean-Luc.
			This meeting isn't for you,
			Wesley!
			Why not, sir? You helped make
			me a bridge officer...
			... an acting ensign.
			All right, he stays. The first
			thing he'll hear is... because I've
			been given unusual powers, I'm
			not suddenly a monster. Except
			for those abilities, and I don't
			yet know how far they go... I'm
			the same William T. Riker you've
			always known.
			Well? Everyone still looks
			uncomfortable.
			Perhaps we're all remembering the
			old saying... "power corrupts... "
			... "and absolute power corrupts
			absolutely." Do you believe I
			haven't thought of that, Jean-Luc?
			And have you noticed that you and
			I are now on a first-name basis?
			Will, something has happened to
			you already...
			In what way? Haven't you seen
			how much I've regretted not saving
			that child? Captain, using the
			"Q" power to save her might not
			have been wrong!
			No more than it was wrong to save
			the rest of you from those soldier
			things.
			Let's keep in mind that particular
			danger was invented by "Q".
			What we represent to the "Q",
			Will, are lowly animals, tormented
			into performing for their
			amusement...
			Actually, they think highly of
			us, Troi. We have a quality
			of... of growth which they
			admire...
			Or fear?
			Number One, we've learned that
			the "Q" power does not admire
			us... "Q" has muddled your mind
			somehow.
			It's your mind that troubles me,
			Captain. Don't you understand
			his incredible gift to me?
			Are these truly your "friends,"
			Brother?
			Let us pray for understanding,
			for compassion, for...
			Let us do no such damned thing!
			What is this need of yours for
			costumes? Have you no identity
			of your own?
			I come in search of truth.
			You come in search of what
			humanity is!
			I forgive your blasphemy...
			Can't you see it, Number One?
			He's nothing but a flim-flam man!
			That's what he's been since his
			first appearance at Farpoint!
			Flim-flam?
			You offer Riker jealousy! What
			I offer him is clearly beyond your
			comprehension!
			How can you claim friendship for
			Riker while obstructing his way
			to the greatest adventure ever
			offered a human?!
			"Obstruct him?" Then it's not
			yet certain? He's not yet
			committed?
			The truly evil part of this is
			your jealousy, Captain.
			You love each one of your people!
			Demonstrate it! You have the
			power to leave each of them with
			a gift proving your affection.
			There'd be no... harm, would there,
			if I, if I gave them something
			I know they'd like?
			How touching. A plea to his
			former captain.
			"May I please give some happiness
			to my friends, sir? Please sir?"
			In fact... I authorize and support
			that idea, Riker.
			And please cooperate with him,
			if you wish.
			Are you certain, sir? If...
			I'm quite certain, Counselor.
			By all means, demonstrate your
			gifts of affection.
			Remarkable! He rises now above
			jealousy.
			Don't be frightened. There is
			no way I could harm any one of
			you. Shall I guess your dreams?
			Leave now, Wesley!
			No! Wesley, I may know best of
			all.
			Our friendship, our long talks...
			No, please... !
			Have your favorite wish, my young
			friend!
			Hey Wes, you've grown into a very
			good looking guy!
			Data...
			No!
			It's what you've always wanted,
			Data to become human!
			Yes, sir, that is true. But I
			never wanted to compound one
			illusion with another. It might
			seem real to "Q" -- even you,
			sir... but it would not be so to
			me. Was it not one of the
			Captain's favorite authors who
			wrote, "This above all, to thine
			own self be true?"
			Sorry, Commander, I must decline.
			Well, my friend, I know what you
			want. Welcome to the wonderful
			world of vision.
			You're as beautiful as I imagined,
			and more.
			Then we can throw the VISOR away?
			I think not, sir. The price is
			a little high for me. I don't
			like who I would have to thank.
			I can still steer the ship with
			this.
			If you accept this new you,
			Wesley, you'll lose wonderful
			times, so many important
			experiences...
			And Worf, who wants nothing...
			Except honor and my duty
			fulfilled.
			Proud warrior Worf, without a
			single tie to his own kind...
			No! She is from a world now alien
			to me. I have no place in my life
			for this now!
			Mister Riker...
			... it's too soon for this...
			If it's because your mother
			objects...
			No, I'd just like to get there
			on my own. Honest!
			How did you know, sir? I feel
			like such... such an idiot!
			Quite right, you should!
			But it was... such a pleasure to
			have been able to do those things.
			It's all over "Q". You have no
			further business here.
			Human, you have just destroyed
			yourself... !
			But only after you've paid off
			your wager, "Q".
			I recall no wager!
			I'm sure your fellow "Q" remember
			you agreed to never trouble our
			species again. Just as they're
			aware you've failed to tempt a
			human to join you. So, "Q", I
			strongly suspect you have some
			explaining of your own to do...
			Extraordinary! "Q" sought to
			discover the distinguishing
			characteristic of humanity and
			never learned what Coleridge
			said: "It must be the possession
			of a soul within us that makes
			the difference."
			Sir... we show the same "hole" in
			time again. Our instruments say
			we've just now beamed up from our
			rescue mission.
			How can the "Q" handle time and
			space so well, and us so badly?
			Perhaps we'll discover some day
			that time and space are simpler
			than the human equation.
			No coordinates laid in, Number
			One?
			Uh... yes, sir.
			You have my coordinates, Mister
			La Forge.
			Zero-zero-eight, Mark,
			three-three-nine, sir.
			Engage!
