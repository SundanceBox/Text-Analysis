			Hey, Jake! Wait a second!
			How're you doing?
			I'm fine. Really.
			I'm real sorry...
			Acting Ensign Crusher, report to
			Deck Twenty-one Forward Lounge.
			It's not your fault.
			Yes, I know, but I wish we were
			both going.
			Only thirty-two points...
			Acting Ensign Crusher, respond.
			I'm on my way.
			Gotta go.
			Do well for both of us.
			Mom, I can't be late.
			Don't worry. You have time.
			Happy Birthday, Wesley!
			Thanks everybody. But it's not
			until next month.
			Close enough.
			You won't be here next month.
			After you pass the entrance exam,
			you'll be on your way to Starfleet
			Academy.
			Go on, make a wish.
			You'll breeze through those
			tests.
			I hope so, sir.
			I know so. I remember how tough
			it was for me.
			But you've got brains, and family
			tradition, and actual experience.
			I wish I felt that sure.
			I was scared to death the whole
			time. But it's good for you.
			Keeps your adrenaline going. Not
			that you'll need it, Wes.
			Thank you... Humans are
			fascinating. They celebrate the
			passage of time with such joy
			until a certain age, and then it
			becomes a topic of some
			discomfort. I suppose it is
			because each birthday is another
			step towards inevitable death.
			Do Klingons observe birthdays,
			Worf?
			Klingons are born, live as
			warriors, and die.
			Then how do you know how old you
			are?
			I don't. Do you know?
			I have no age.
			Is there something wrong?
			No. I am simply trying to
			understand the celebration of
			aging. And how old were you when
			Wesley was born, Doctor?
			Have some cake, Data.
			I do not understand, sir. Why...
			You never ask a woman her age,
			Mister Data.
			I am very confused, sir.
			Some customs will never change.
			Acting Ensign Crusher, this is
			the Transporter Room. We are
			ready to beam you down to Relva 7.
			Thanks for the party, everyone.
			And the good wishes.
			Captain Picard.
			Picard here.
			We've received communication from
			Relva 7 that Admiral Gregory Quinn
			is about to beam aboard, sir.
			Admiral Gregory Quinn. Why wasn't
			I informed earlier, Lieutenant
			Yar?
			We just received the request, sir.
			I'm on my way to the Transporter
			Room, Lieutenant. Number One!
			This is unexpected. Welcome
			aboard, Admiral.
			Thank you. Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard, Lieutenant Commander
			Dexter Remmick.
			Sir.
			Allow me to present my staff:
			First Officer William Riker, Chief
			Medical Officer Beverly Crusher,
			chief of security, Lieutenant
			Tasha Yar.
			What can we do for you?
			I need to speak with you.
			Certainly. This way. Number One.
			No. Alone.
			Is this personal?
			Official business.
			Then my first officer...
			... Alone, Captain.
			Captain's log, stardate 41416. 2.
			We are orbiting Relva 7, one of
			the testing sites where final
			examinations are taking place for
			entrance into Starfleet Academy.
			But with the appearance of my old
			colleague, Admiral Gregory Quinn,
			our stay has taken on another
			meaning.
			Commander Remmick is with the
			Inspector General's office.
			Oh?
			He'll be conducting a complete
			investigation of the Enterprise.
			What are you looking for?
			I have reason to believe there
			may be something very wrong on
			this ship... very wrong.
			Tell me what you suspect.
			No. It's... inappropriate to
			discuss it now. We'll go over
			it fully when Mister Remmick
			concludes his investigation.
			You will find out what is wrong
			on this ship. Starfleet is
			depending on you.
			Yes, sir.
			Nothing and no one will stand in
			my way.
			And you, Captain, are ordered to
			cooperate in every way necessary
			with the investigation. Clear?
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Remmick, unless there are
			further questions...
			No questions, sir.
			Get on with your duties.
			Yes, sir!
			Greg, we've known each other for
			years. If you weren't just
			motivating young Mister Remmick, tell
			me what you believe is wrong.
			Captain, it is vitally important
			that my orders are followed
			exactly. I'll be staying on the
			ship.
			As you wish, Admiral.
			What is it?
			What?
			The unit you just put down. Don't
			worry. I won't tell anybody.
			Oh. It's a flux coordinating
			sensor.
			I'm Oliana Mirren, one of the
			other finalists. You must be
			Wesley Crusher.
			Yeah! You know me?
			I heard there was a very smart,
			very young man who'd be tough
			competition.
			Well, you wouldn't be here if...
			... I weren't smart? I know. But
			there's a lot more to it than
			that. You're lucky - you've had
			practical experience on the
			Enterprise.
			Oliana.
			T'Shanik of Vulcana Regar.
			Wesley Crusher, from the
			Enterprise.
			You don't look as if you meet the
			age requirements.
			Uh, I'll be sixteen next month.
			Happy birthday. When this is all
			over, we'll celebrate.
			Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.
			Mordock.
			Mordock? The Mordock? The
			Benzite who constructed the
			Mordock Strategy? I thought you
			already were in the Academy.
			No. Only a hopeful, like you.
			You're a legend in the Galactic
			Computer Network...
			Finalists, please take your
			seats...
			I'm TAC Officer Chang. Welcome.
			You are here because you are all
			top candidates. Although only
			one student will be chosen for
			the Academy, you have shown from
			the preliminary testing that any
			of you could easily qualify.
			We are looking for the person who
			combines all the important
			qualities necessary to be part
			of Starfleet's future. Integrity,
			intelligence, courage,
			imagination... and that
			indefinable quality of leadership.
			This may be the most difficult,
			exhausting experience of your
			life. And the most exciting
			challenge. Expect the
			unexpected... May you all do your
			best... Now, we'll begin.
			May I help you, Mister Remmick?
			Just keep on doing whatever it
			is you're doing, Commander Data.
			Yes, sir.
			There's nothing much to see here,
			Commander. We're in standard
			orbit. And, uh, the station has
			to be manned, even if it's
			routine...
			Is there something I can help you
			with, Mister Remmick?
			When I'm ready, Mister Riker, I'll
			want to speak with you.
			Privately.
			Just having that guy around makes
			me feel guilty.
			Commander, what's this guy after?
			I don't know, Geordi. But I'm
			going to find out. Now.
			Come.
			Captain, may I speak frankly?
			Always, Number One.
			As executive officer, I should
			be informed. I should know
			everything you know.
			I agree. You should.
			What's this about? Remmick is
			going to turn this ship upside
			down.
			That is his job.
			And mine is to make sure the ship
			runs smoothly.
			Which you do very well.
			Sir, am I under investigation?
			I don't know.
			And if you did?
			I couldn't tell you.
			I don't understand, sir. This
			is extremely frustrating.
			No less so for me. But I have
			promised full cooperation. And
			we shall give it.
			Sir.
			I want some answers from you now,
			Commander Riker.
			Later.
			You were ordered to cooperate...
			When it doesn't interfere with
			my duty. Not now, Remmick!
			Last question on the Hyper Space
			Physics test: If the matter and
			antimatter tanks on a Galaxy Class
			starship are nine-tenths depleted,
			calculate the intermix ratio
			necessary to reach a starbase a
			hundred light years away at warp
			factor eight...
			Thank you, students. You now have
			one hour free before the next
			test.
			I admit, Wesley, you have a very
			fast mind.
			As soon as I realized it was a
			trick question, there was only
			one answer.
			Yes. There is only one "ratio"
			with matter-antimatter. One to
			one.
			You're both very lucky. I can't
			imagine what it feels like to have
			things come so easily. I have
			to push every step of the way.
			Oh, no, Oliana, it doesn't come
			easily. I have to study all the
			time. Mordock's the one who's
			brilliant.
			You really don't know, do you?
			It's a good thing you're cute,
			Wesley, or you could really be
			obnoxious.
			See you later.
			Did you hear that Mordock? She
			said I was cute!
			Is that good, Wesley?
			I don't know. I think so. Maybe.
			I don't know.
			Perhaps I was incorrect about the
			speed of your thought processes,
			Wesley.
			Captain, I think I should
			apologize.
			No need, Number One. Mister
			Remmick's presence is unnerving,
			to say the least.
			Regardless, sir, I should realize
			that whatever your reasons are,
			they're valid. Whether or not
			I understand them.
			Are you available now, Mister Riker?
			Or do you still have duties to
			perform?
			I'm available, Mister Remmick.
			Any problem with using your Ready
			Room, Captain?
			I'll find him a comfortable place
			on Deck Fifteen, sir.
			It's more convenient here. Is
			there a problem, Captain?
			No, Mister Remmick. Be my guest.
			There are several seeming
			discrepancies in the captain's
			log. Let's go over them, one by
			one, shall we?
			The captain's log?
			Yes. To your knowledge, has the
			captain ever falsified a log?
			Have you discussed this with him?
			Right now, I'm asking you.
			If you want to discuss anything
			about Captain Picard, bring him
			in here and ask him face to face.
			You are required to answer my
			questions, Mister Riker. Unless
			you're trying to cover something
			up? Now, there are several
			discrepancies in the captain's
			log. Shall we go over them, one
			by one?
			Proceed.
			Do you believe the captain is
			emotionally and psychologically
			fit for command of this starship?
			There is nothing in his history
			or his personality that might
			suggest... mental lapses?
			Nothing.
			Not even the Ferengi incident with
			his old ship, the Stargazer?
			He was being controlled by a
			mind-altering machine, Commander.
			Without his knowledge.
			I would say that was a mental
			lapse.
			So, you are saying Captain Picard
			had no control over this vessel.
			He handed it over to Kosinski,
			who took the entire crew to some
			sort of "alternate" universe.
			No, sir. That's not what I'm
			saying. Kosinski was sent by
			Starfleet to improve our warp
			drive. The captain was ordered
			to take him aboard.
			According to his own logs, the
			bridge crew didn't think highly
			of Mister Kosinski's theories, yet
			the captain allowed him access
			to the engines anyway. Is that
			true, La Forge?
			Not exactly, sir.
			One way or the other, La Forge,
			Picard lost control of this ship.
			Is that true?
			Yes, but that's not how it
			happened.
			So, the answer is yes.
			Ensign Crusher... What are you
			doing on the Holodeck? I thought
			you were still on Relva 7.
			I'm through testing for the day.
			I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
			I'll leave.
			No! Stay. I thought I wanted
			to be by myself, but I guess I
			didn't really.
			How is the testing?
			Okay. So far. It's not the ones
			I've studied for I'm worried
			about. It's the Psych Test,
			facing my deepest fear and living
			through it. I don't even know
			what it is. I'm trying to figure
			out what images to bring up.
			Why?
			I wanna scare myself. What do
			you think -- Bulgallian rats?
			Lightning storm?
			Do those things frighten you?
			Kinda. But's it's exciting, too.
			You know, that rolling feeling
			in your stomach?
			No. I don't know. Wesley... The
			Psych Test is no more or less
			important than the rest of the
			process.
			That's what they said, but it's
			all I can think about.
			Thinking about what you can't
			control simply wastes your energy
			and creates its own fear.
			How can they know what my deepest
			fear is when I don't?
			By analyzing your psychological
			profile. They were right about
			everyone I tested with. Including
			myself.
			You? I didn't think there was
			anything that could frighten a
			Klingon warrior.
			Only fools have no fear.
			I'm sorry, Lieutenant Worf. I
			shouldn't ask so many personal
			questions.
			It is very... difficult for me
			to depend on anyone else. For
			anything. But especially for my
			life.
			But on the Enterprise you do that
			every day. Everyone depends on
			everyone else to protect them.
			Yes.
			Then you got over it.
			No. It is still my enemy.
			... With this new extricator, sir,
			we could eliminate three other
			bulky machines from cargo space.
			Excellent, Number One.
			Captain, there's an unauthorized
			entry in Main Shuttlebay.
			"Unauthorized?"
			Who is it, Lieutenant?
			The computer reads the I.D.
			number of... Jake Kurland.
			Bridge to Main Shuttlebay.
			Mister Kurland... This is Captain
			Picard. Respond.
			Isn't the area secured? I want
			answers.
			Not now, Remmick... Captain, he's
			going to take her out.
			Lock off the bay launch doors.
			Too late, sir. He's using the
			flight emergency override...
			Smart kid.
			... He's launching!
			Enterprise to shuttlecraft.
			Mister Kurland.
			Captain Picard. I'm going to
			Beltane Nine to sign onto a
			freighter. Tell my father I'm
			sorry.
			Tell him in person. Bring the
			ship back. Now.
			No. I can't face him. I'm
			leaving.
			I've lost power!
			All he's got left are his
			maneuvering jets.
			At that trajectory, he'll hit the
			atmosphere and melt at two hundred
			kilometers.
			Probable impact?
			Atmospheric entry... seventy-eight
			seconds.
			Options?
			He's out of transporter range.
			Tractor beam?
			Won't work. He's too far away
			for a positive lock.
			You're completely responsible for
			that boy's life, Captain.
			Either get out of my way and be
			quiet, or I will have you escorted
			from the bridge... Visual on
			shuttle cockpit.
			Visual on Main Viewer.
			The engine's dead. What am I
			gonna do?
			Stay calm, Jake. We'll get you
			back.
			Please help me!
			Jake!
			It's no use, Captain. I'm going
			to die out here.
			Mister Kurland! You are not going
			to die out there. Do exactly
			as I tell you. Take the nose of
			the shuttle and aim it directly
			at Relva 7.
			Aim it at Relva? I can't do
			that. It's crazy.
			Twenty-eight seconds to impact...
			Jake, listen carefully. I'm the
			captain and I'm giving you an
			order. Aim the shuttle at Relva.
			Now.
			Okay. It's done.
			Good. Monitor your speed
			exactly. When it hits point zero-two-zero,
			I want you to restart
			the engine and pull up, hard!
			Point zero-two-zero speed...
			Captain, I sure hope you're right.
			You'll just have to trust me.
			Point zero-zero-three; zero-zero-nine;
			zero-one-two...
			Hang on tight. It's going to be
			bumpy.
			Zero-one-five, zero-one-nine.
			Now! Start the engine!
			Incredible, Captain!
			He bounced her off the atmosphere!
			Mister Kurland, can you maneuver the
			shuttle home?
			Yes, sir.
			Do so. Then report to Mister Riker.
			Yes, sir!
			Main Shuttle Bay, prepare to
			receive shuttle.
			Very... original, Captain. But
			how did this child gain access
			to a Shuttlecraft?
			Kurland is a highly qualified
			Enterprise Academy candidate and
			fully trained in many areas ...
			including shuttles.
			And did this "full" training
			include discipline?
			Young men sometimes make rash
			choices, Mister Remmick. Which is
			why Mister Kurland will receive a
			strong refresher specifically in
			discipline...
			I'll note that in my report.
			Full cooperation, Number One.
			Oliana!
			Oh. Hi, Wes.
			I, um, thought you might want to
			have lunch... together.
			Thanks, but I'm not very hungry.
			Oh... okay.
			It's not you... it's just that
			Mordock and you are so far ahead
			in points, I'll never catch up.
			Oh. Sorry.
			You're not leaving., are you?
			And give up? Never. Besides,
			it'll be good practice for next
			year. See you later.
			Ah, Wesley. Distracted by the
			female human again. No matter.
			It does not seem to diminish your
			mental faculties. You do good
			work.
			Me? No, you're the one. I've
			studied the Mordock Strategy...
			Are you a player of Benzite chess?
			Sure!
			If you like, we can discuss this
			at lunch... I am hungry.
			Me too!
			You. I have a package for
			Operations. Where is it?
			End of the corridor on your right.
			Room 406...
			You blocked my path... you
			Bulgallian sludge rat!
			I apologize. An honest mistake,
			okay? I'm sorry.
			Is there a problem here,
			gentlemen?
			No, sir... I, he...
			How dare you! I am Rondon, you
			despicable Melanoid slimeworm!
			Liar!
			Who do you think you're bullying?
			You bumped into me. It was your
			mistake. You were rude.
			Do you want this to become
			violent?
			Friend. I like you.
			A very strange reaction.
			Not really. When he held up his
			hand, I could see it was
			webbed... the sign of a Zaldan.
			But you became hostile.
			Zaldans are infuriated by
			courtesy. They see it as a form
			of phony social behavior, designed
			to hide real feelings.
			Congratulations, Mister Crusher.
			You handled that particular
			incident very well.
			Was that "incident" deliberate?
			It's important to know how you
			candidates deal with other
			cultures, other species.
			Then it was a test.
			Yes. Not all tests are
			announced. Or what they appear
			to be.
			Zaldans have webbed fingers?
			I wouldn't have passed.
			Commander Data, I'm getting very
			little cooperation from the bridge
			crew. You're an android, correct?
			Yes, sir.
			And as an android, you are
			programmed to tell the entire
			truth?
			Yes, sir.
			There is a problem with this ship,
			Mister Data. It's in the records,
			somewhere. I need your help to
			find it.
			All the ship's records are
			available to you, sir.
			This information is very cleverly
			hidden. Your captain is not what
			he appears to be. Do not forget
			you have loyalty to Starfleet
			above all else.
			Loyalty is not the issue,
			Commander. There is nothing wrong
			with Captain Picard -- or the
			ship's logs. Therefore there must
			be something wrong with your
			original assumption.
			That is not acceptable, Mister Data.
			Acceptable or not, sir, it is the
			truth.
			Just how did this contaminant come
			on board?
			By accident, sir.
			Meaning Captain Picard has no
			standing procedure for this type
			of situation?
			No. Meaning "by accident" sir.
			You don't like me very much, do
			you?
			Is it required, sir?
			How would you characterize your
			relationship with Captain Picard?
			We're officers of Starfleet who
			have known each other for many
			years.
			Everything said here is
			confidential, Doctor. You can
			be completely open with me.
			About what?
			About how you feel serving with
			a man who was responsible for the
			death of your husband.
			My personal feelings about
			Captain Picard are irrelevant
			to this investigation. And none
			of your business.
			Then you confirm the logs are
			accurate: you violated the Prime
			Directive with the Edo? You
			deliberately interfered with their
			laws?
			Yes. It's exactly as I explained
			it in the log records.
			All to save Doctor Crusher's son?
			One of my crew was held unjustly.
			I stand by my decision.
			Mister Remmick, you have talked to
			everyone on this ship. I think
			you've had enough time to find
			out whatever it is you need to
			know.
			Are you worried that if I keep
			looking I'll find what you're
			guilty of?
			The only thing I'm guilty of is
			allowing this charade to go on
			too long.
			If it's me you're after, Admiral,
			ask me directly what you want to
			know. Then tell me exactly what's
			going on.
			I need a little more time,
			Jean-Luc.
			How much time? I won't tolerate
			my crew being harassed any longer.
			Remmick's full report is almost
			ready.
			I want to be here when he presents
			it.
			That has always been my intention.
			Commander Remmick, report to
			Admiral Quinn.
			On my way, sir.
			This has been a strain on our
			friendship.
			I know. Believe me, Jean-Luc,
			I regret that, but it has been
			necessary.
			This test will be graded as to
			the number of problems you
			complete within the allotted time.
			The Carlundrum I.Q. Test will now
			appear. The task is to predict
			the variable patterns of Platonic
			Solids. Your responses will be
			timed. Begin.
			I... I can't get... it.
			Don't fight it. Relax into it
			and just do it automatically.
			No... it's going too fast!
			You're doing all right...
			No... no. Wesley, I can't do it.
			(DIALOGUE TO BE WRITTEN)
			Test completed.
			Mister Chang...
			Congratulations, Mordock. That
			was the second fastest time
			recorded on this test. You all
			did well.
			It should not have been that way.
			Mister Crusher helped me.
			Yes. I know. An interesting
			choice, Mister Crusher. Especially
			considering how close you and Mister
			Mordock are in overall score.
			Yes, sir.
			You all have an hour to prepare
			for your last test.
			The Psych Test, sir?
			We prefer to think of it as a
			psychological evaluation based
			on reactions to various individual
			problems.
			But the Psych Test will do.
			Sir.
			Please sit down, Mister Remmick.
			Proceed with your report.
			Admiral, I've done my best to be
			objective during this
			investigation. And yet, I feel
			a sense of failure.
			Continue.
			I couldn't find what you asked,
			sir. I spoke with officer after
			officer, at length. I probed the
			log reports. And I have found
			nothing wrong. Except, perhaps,
			a casual familiarity among the
			bridge crew, but... mostly that
			comes from a sense of teamwork.
			I'm sorry, sir. I did my best.
			Quite. You're dismissed,
			Commander.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain Picard, my tour in the
			Inspector General's office will
			be up in six months. When I'm
			finished, this is where I'd like
			to serve, sir.
			Don't judge the young man too
			harshly. He's a good officer.
			It's not him I'm judging.
			Don't judge me too harshly,
			either. Not until I'm finished.
			We had to be very sure about you.
			Some time ago, a few of us in
			Starfleet Command became
			suspicious of problems within
			the Federation.
			What kind of problems?
			Something or someone is trying
			to destroy the fabric of all we've
			built over the last two hundred
			years.
			What's your evidence?
			I can't go into that. Too many
			other people are involved. But
			if we're right, this is the most
			critical time in the history of
			the Federation.
			What do you want from me?
			I don't know if the threat is
			coming from within or from the
			outside. I need people I can trust
			in strong positions throughout
			the Federation.
			You have my complete support.
			You know that.
			Not enough. I want to promote
			you to admiral, Jean-Luc. I want
			you to take over as Commandant
			of Starfleet Academy.
			The Academy?
			Yes. I need you close.
			Then there was never a problem
			with the Enterprise.
			No. I had to be sure you hadn't
			been co-opted.
			Greg, the real issue is politics.
			I'm no good at politics. Surely
			there are others more suited.
			I sense you're doubtful about
			this. All right. Suppose it's
			the rambling paranoia of an old
			man. Even if I am wrong, and I
			hope I am, you're still the best
			man for the job.
			I appreciate the value of what
			you're offering. It's not
			something I can decide quickly.
			I need your answer soon, Captain.
			All right. You'll have it
			tonight, Admiral.
			Mister Mordock will be finished with
			his Psych Test momentarily.
			Mordock? Are you... all right?
			I will be...
			Mister Crusher... you're next. Good
			luck.
			Hello?
			I'm here. I'm, uh, ready.
			Maybe they forgot.
			Breathe. Gotta remember to
			breathe.
			Somebody help! Something's wrong
			in the lab!
			Help! We're trapped. Help!
			We're gonna die.
			Evacuate immediately. Sixty-five
			seconds to life-support seal-off.
			Evacuate immediately. Forty-five
			seconds to life-support seal-off.
			Help me move this!
			You have to help me!
			I can't! It's too late. We're
			going to die! The liquid
			hydrogen's gonna blow!
			Please don't leave me! The
			shut-off valve ruptured. If we
			don't get out of here fast,
			they'll seal us off to contain
			the explosion!
			Evacuate immediately. Twenty-five
			seconds to seal-off.
			Come on!
			There's no way out! I can't move
			through that!
			You have to. I can't carry you
			both! You can walk. Come on.
			Evacuate immediately. Five
			seconds to seal-off.
			I'm sorry.
			Officer Chang! There's been an...
			It's all right, Wesley.
			Thanks.
			Excellent performance, Mister
			Crusher.
			Performance?!... That was the test.
			Yes.
			But a man died!
			Theoretically, yes. You had to
			make a choice. And you did.
			There's no right or wrong about
			it. Your greatest fear has been
			that you couldn't make that
			decision.
			Because of my father? Because
			Cap... someone made that choice
			and my father died.
			Sir?
			Yes, Number One?
			Mister Remmick has left the ship.
			Yes. He found nothing wrong on
			the Enterprise. You may inform
			the crew that Admiral Quinn is
			most impressed.
			Thank you. They'll be pleased...
			Can you explain now what he was
			after?
			They were after me, Number One.
			They want me to take over as
			Commandant of Starfleet Academy.
			Congratulations! What a wonderful
			choice, sir! You'll be able to
			shape the minds of the future
			leaders of Starfleet.
			You haven't decided what you're
			going to do.
			Yes I have, Number One. I'm
			going for a walk.
			I'm proud of all of you. You've
			done a superb job. Each of you
			would make a fine Starfleet
			officer. It's unfair that only
			one candidate from Relva will
			attend the Academy this year --
			and a loss to the Federation if
			the rest of you do not return to
			test again... Mister Mordock will
			be the candidate. His results
			were slightly higher than Mister
			Crusher's. Congratulations, Mister
			Mordock. You are the first
			Benzite in Starfleet.
			Thank you, sir, but it's not
			right. It shouldn't be me.
			Wesley lost points because he
			helped me. He shouldn't be
			punished for his generosity.
			He wasn't. He lost time, but
			it wasn't only that...
			Candidates, thank you and good
			luck.
			I am sorry, Wesley.
			It's okay. You deserved to win.
			Besides, you would've done the
			same thing for me.
			Yes. I believe I would.
			Congratulations.
			Well, personally, I hate losing.
			So you'd better be ready next
			year, Wesley. I won't be easy
			to beat.
			Mister Kurland!
			Yes, sir.
			Are you... feeling better?
			Yes, sir... I'm sorry I damaged
			the shuttle. But Mister Riker says
			I can work on fixing it as part
			of my "discipline" training.
			Good idea. I hope you learned
			that running away doesn't solve
			anything, young man.
			Yes, sir. I'm sorry I messed up.
			I know. But you did keep your
			wits about you out there... don't
			forget that.
			No, sir. And... thank you for
			saving my life.
			You're welcome.
			Mister Crusher? Why aren't you in
			your dress uniform for Admiral
			Quinn's farewell dinner?
			I... I didn't think it would be
			appropriate.
			Why not?
			I failed, Captain. I didn't get
			into the Academy. I failed you...
			and the Enterprise.
			Ridiculous. Did you do your best?
			When you test next year -- and
			you will test again -- do you
			think your performance will
			improve?
			Well, yes...
			Good. The only person you're
			truly competing against is
			yourself.
			Then you're not disappointed?
			Your failures and successes have
			to be measured within, Wesley.
			Not by me or anyone else... But
			if it helps you to know this, I
			failed my first time. And you
			may not tell anyone!
			You? You failed?
			Yes. But not the second time.
			Now, do me the honor of sitting
			next to me at dinner. I'm going
			to have to disappoint an old
			friend.
			I wish I could convince you to
			change your mind.
			I'll serve you better here.
			This is where you belong.
			If you need me...
			I've been playing politics too
			long. Perhaps I see conspiracy
			everywhere. Don't worry.
			Safe travels, my friend.
			Set course to Algeron 4, Mister
			Crusher.
			Course plotted and laid in, sir.
			You know, we're really alike, you
			and I. Both explorers to the
			core... Engage, Mister Crusher.
