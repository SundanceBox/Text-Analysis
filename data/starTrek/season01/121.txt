			Captain's log, stardate 41798.2.
			We are ordered by Starfleet, to
			proceed to the Lorenze Cluster
			and investigate the disappearance
			of the light cruiser USS Drake,
			which was in that system trying
			to unravel a mystery of its own.
			Recent long range probes indicate
			that all intelligent life on the
			planet Minos has disappeared.
			Number One?
			No help from their communications
			log. The Drake reported
			arriving at Minos and was never
			heard from again.
			Mister Data?
			The citizens of Minos gained fame
			during the Ersalrope wars as
			arms merchants. They manufactured
			sophisticated and highly advanced
			weaponry.
			For which side?
			Both.
			We are nearing the planet Minos.
			Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.
			Aye, sir. Standard orbit.
			Whatever happened to the Drake,
			happened quickly, otherwise
			Captain Rice would have sent
			another message.
			You know Captain Rice?
			We were at the Academy together.
			Tell me about him.
			Able. A good officer.
			How would he react under stress?
			Paul Rice is confident almost to
			the point of arrogance, but
			carries it well because he usually
			makes the right choices. He's
			a risk taker.
			Oh.
			I'll give you an example. One
			of the final tests in advance
			navigation at the Academy presents
			the student with three options.
			When Rice took the test, he
			rejected all of them and offered
			one of his own.
			I'd call that arrogant.
			But it paid off -- he received the
			top mark. And now that test has
			four options. The original
			three... plus his.
			In a difficult situation a man
			like that would react aggressively.
			Agreed.
			Number One, weren't you offered
			the Drake?
			Yes.
			You turned down your own command
			to take this assignment?
			At the time, I thought it was
			more advantageous for me to do
			a tour on the Enterprise.
			Captain -- readings correspond
			with the findings of the probe. 
			No signs of intelligent life-forms.
			Vegetation and animal life only.
			None?
			Correct.
			What happened to all those people?
			War?
			Disease?
			A dissatisfied customer?
			In any war, natural disaster, or
			even the most virulent plague,
			there are always survivors.
			Captain, we are being hailed.
			How is that possible from a planet
			with no people?
			Your sensors indicated no
			intelligent life?
			Correct.
			Put it on the Main Viewer.
			Whoever you are -- wherever you're
			from -- greetings and welcome to
			Minos -- the Arsenal of Freedom...
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the USS Enterprise. To whom am
			I speaking?
			... Where we live by the motto --
			peace through superior firepower.
			Come -- allow us to meet your
			needs. If you need a little
			something special, be it for one
			target -- or multiple targets -- we
			got it, you'll see it... here on
			the Arsenal of Freedom. Because
			we don't just provide weapons --
			we also offer complete weapon
			systems.
			It is a recorded message.
			To be totally armed is to be
			totally secure...
			It must be left over from the time
			of the Romulan wars, when the
			business of selling arms was
			booming.
			... Remember, the early bird that
			hesitates gets wormed. Perfection
			in highly-advanced weaponry.
			Versatility... flexibility.
			And... everything one hundred
			percent guaranteed... So lock on
			to my signal and beam on down.
			Screen off.
			It's a heck of a sales pitch.
			If an automated message system
			is still functioning -- other
			systems on the planet may also
			be operational.
			Weapons systems?
			Possibly.
			We are going to have to go down
			there to find it.
			Prepare your away team, Number
			One.
			Lieutenant Yar -- Commander Data.
			Commander, I recommend a minimum
			complement.
			Oh? I would have thought
			otherwise.
			We'll keep the first landing party
			small and mobile. Until I'm
			confident that whatever killed
			the inhabitants of this planet
			isn't still down there.
			Spooky.
			Riker.
			Bridge. Captain speaking.
			We'll start a pattern search
			from this point.
			Keep this channel open.
			Aye, sir.
			Commander, our communications are
			being monitored.
			By whom?
			Sir, since there is no intelligent
			life, the question is "by what?"
			Captain.
			Yes, I heard, Number One. We'll
			try to track it down from here.
			Tritanium. It's been melted.
			What could do that?
			Whatever it was, it's beyond our
			technology.
			Over here.
			We've never even seen anything
			like this.
			It's undamaged.
			Maybe a demonstration model for
			some potential buyer.
			Maybe. Let's spread out a
			little.
			Commander Riker. This is
			Lieutenant Solis. I am
			monitoring a slight energy
			buildup near your position.
			I am not able to pinpoint the
			source.
			Give me a direction.
			East of your position -- ten
			meters. I will continue
			monitoring.
			I can't see anything from here.
			The underbrush is very thick.
			Hello... Commander Riker.
			Rice! Where did you come from?
			I was over there.
			You had us worried. But, I should
			have known you'd pop up.
			How are you, Commander Riker?
			Me -- never mind me. How are you?
			No word, no message... nothing.
			How many are with you?
			Two others. Where's the
			Drake? Where's your crew?
			What's going on Number One?
			It's Paul Rice from the Drake.
			Lieutenant Solis?
			Sensors indicate low level energy
			readings, but the only life signs
			are the away team.
			Careful, Number One.
			Understood.
			You look strange, Paul...
			I was injured getting here.
			Do you need medical help?
			No. What is your purpose here?
			This is Commander Data and
			Lieutenant Yar.
			Other than ourselves, sir, I am
			picking up no other life signs
			here.
			Yes. I know.
			Riker, you didn't answer me. Who
			sent you here to look for me?
			Your mother.
			She's worried about you.
			Tell me about your ship -- the
			Enterprise, isn't it?
			No... The name of my ship is the
			Lollipop.
			I have no knowledge of that ship.
			It's just been commissioned. It's
			a good ship.
			Riker, refresh me, would you?
			What's its size and complement?
			Who's here with you?
			What's the armament on the
			Lollipop?
			Paul -- I will only answer your
			questions if you answer mine.
			Why do you want to know so much
			about my ship?
			We're friends, aren't we?
			Old friends.
			Our top speed is warp three.
			What's yours?
			"Is?" Then the Drake has not
			been destroyed.
			The Drake?
			Yes, your ship?
			Of course -- my ship is the
			Drake.
			Where is it?
			Classified.
			Classified?
			Please -- it's important. Our
			survival depends on knowing.
			What's the armament on your ship?
			Ten.
			Ten? I don't understand. Ten
			what?
			Six.
			Commander Riker, those answers
			make no sense.
			You haven't used my first name
			once, Paul.
			You remember it, don't you?
			Because you don't even exist.
			You're a fake -- an image of the
			original! Aren't you?... Answer me!
			Report, Number One.
			The image of Rice has been
			replaced by something which
			is hovering several meters away.
			Number One, get your team back
			here.
			Prepare to beam up.
			Commander.
			What just happened down there?
			Number One! Report!
			Report! Report!
			He can't answer you, Captain.
			Commander Riker has been encased
			is a cube of complex lucinium
			compound.
			Is he alive?
			Unknown.
			Transporter Room Three - have you
			locked on to the away team?
			I am unable to lock on to
			Commander Riker.
			Lieutenant Solis, situation
			report.
			The previous energy readings are
			gone.
			Data, have you been able to
			assess Commander Riker's
			condition?
			He appears to be in a kind of
			stasis.
			Theorize. What's the purpose of
			the encasement?
			Typically, the purpose of such
			an enclosure is for storage.
			Which would suggest what?
			That sooner or later someone or
			something will be along to collect
			him.
			Stand by. I'm coming down.
			You, sir?
			Yes.
			Doctor Crusher, this is the
			Captain. Meet me in Transporter
			Room Three.
			Mister La Forge, you have command
			of the bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			Whatever happens below, your
			prime responsibility is to the
			ship.
			Understood.
			Captain! I must take exception
			to your decision to beam down.
			Noted.
			What is it?
			The encasing material appears to
			be solid...
			I am getting no life signs.
			He's alive. What he ran into is
			an intelligence gathering device
			used during the Ersalrope Wars.
			Probably developed here.
			It projects an image of someone
			the subject will trust -- gets as
			much information as possible.
			If it's found out -- it encases
			the subject to await a more
			detailed interrogation later.
			Clever.
			Can you remove it?
			Yes -- but I cannot predict the
			risk to Commander Riker.
			We have little choice. Whatever
			has him is interrupting the
			transporter beam. Remove it.
			I am picking up energy readings.
			Captain, this is Lieutenant La
			Forge. Sensors indicate energy
			readings in your area.
			Doctor!
			Beverly!
			This one is different.
			It's evasive. Data -- I need you.
			Set your phaser on kill. I'll
			fire so that it will move left,
			and you get it.
			Captain!
			Doctor Crusher.
			Captain Picard.
			I have a malfunction.
			Enterprise, this is Lieutenant
			Yar.
			Mine's out too.
			The close pass by the weapon must
			have disrupted our communicators.
			Keep working. I'll look for
			Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.
			How bad is it?
			Bad... It's my arm.
			Hold on. We'll get you out of
			here.
			Enterprise, this is the Captain.
			Two to beam up.
			Enterprise.
			Data... Lieutenant Yar.
			What's wrong? Why don't they
			work?
			I don't know. But it's all right
			because once they realize our
			communicators are out, the
			sensors will locate us and Geordi
			will beam us up.
			Hold on. It won't be long.
			I can't find them.
			Step back.
			Data.
			All vital signs returning to
			normal.
			Good. Now Geordi can get us out
			of here.
			Sir, I'm reading life-forms on
			the planet. All five members
			of the away team.
			Good. They have freed Riker.
			Transporter Room. Get a lock on
			the away team, and beam them up.
			Shields just came on! Deflectors
			also up --
			I'm picking up an object off our
			port bow -- It's firing!
			Red Alert! Battle stations!
			Shields holding.
			But we can't beam up the away team
			with our shields in place.
			Phasers ready. Photon torpedoes
			standing by. Locking on target...
			Correction: target has
			disappeared!
			Full scan!
			Scanning...
			No readings. Wait -- something
			dead astern --
			Emergency power to shields!
			Object is firing --
			Return fire!
			Aft shields weakened.
			Whatever they're using, our
			shields can't stand up to it much
			longer.
			Captain's log, stardate 41798.25.
			Lieutenant J.G. Geordi La Forge
			in temporary command.
			Orbiting the planet Minos, we are
			under attack.
			Why are we still in orbit? We're
			taking a beating!
			We've got to hold out as long as
			we can. If we can disable our
			attacker, even for a few seconds,
			we can drop our shields and beam
			the away team back aboard.
			If we follow that plan, we'll lose
			the Enterprise! In view of the
			present crisis... I believe you
			should relinquish command to me.
			No.
			I outrank you.
			Mister Logan -- Captain Picard put
			me in command.
			The Captain did not anticipate
			that the Enterprise would come
			under attack. If he had, would
			he have left the bridge to you?
			If he had, he would not have left
			the ship.
			Picking up an object to starboard,
			sir -- heading toward us.
			Lock phasers and fire the moment
			it's in range.
			Aye, sir. Locking and --
			Object has vanished.
			Phaser lock lost.
			Starboard shields weakened.
			It's cloaked itself.
			You can't fight this thing and
			win. We've got to break orbit --
			now.
			Worf -- analyze its firing
			pattern. Maybe we can anticipate
			its location.
			Aye.
			Correlate the trajectory of the
			energy bolts with the attack path.
			I'll compute the optimum spread
			of phasers and photon torpedoes
			to hit it.
			Lieutenant La Forge.
			Geordi -- I know you want to do
			what's best for the Enterprise.
			So do I. Now... the best thing...
			The best thing is for this
			discussion to end and for you to
			get on with your duties. I am
			in charge until relieved by
			Commander Riker or Captain Picard.
			You are ignoring my greater rank
			and experience.
			Not at all, I'm counting on it.
			Get back to Engineering and find
			me every scrap of extra power you
			can. The more we can channel to
			the shields, the longer we can
			hold out.
			All right.
			Have you got a lock on it?
			Impossible to be sure.
			Maybe you should wait here while
			Data and I search for Doctor
			Crusher and Captain Picard.
			I'm a little groggy, but I'll
			be all right.
			I am getting energy readings.
			We'll do it just like before.
			It's got a deflector shield.
			The product continues to upgrade
			and improve.
			Spread out. We'll concentrate
			our fire and try to collapse its
			shield.
			You're right, they keep getting
			better.
			Commander, the weapons are
			appearing at intervals of
			precisely twelve minutes.
			That one took everything we had.
			I don't know how we'll handle the
			next one.
			Then let's try and not be here.
			Come on, let's find the rest of
			our team.
			Oh, no you don't -- no time to
			sleep.
			I'm tired. Very tired.
			Come on, stay with me, Doctor.
			Stay alert, Doctor! That's an
			order, damn it!
			I must have lost a lot of blood.
			I've stopped the bleeding --
			There's another wound. My leg.
			This is going to hurt a bit,
			Doctor.
			I heard that before.
			Doctor -- you have to stay awake
			-- you have to help me! Tell me
			what to do.
			What else can I do?
			The wound needs a clotting agent.
			I can't find your medical kit.
			Those roots. What are they?
			These?
			I don't know.
			Break off a piece and taste it.
			Don't swallow.
			It's very bitter --
			Good. Pound it into a paste and
			spread in onto the wound.
			I understand.
			What do we do next, Doctor?
			Help me -- you've got to help me!
			The patient has lost a great deal
			of blood from multiple
			lacerations. What's your
			diagnosis, Doctor?
			Your patient is going into shock.
			What do I do?
			Elevate the legs and keep her
			warm.
			All right. Stay with me, Doctor.
			Keep talking...
			Did you happen to bring a blanket?
			No, but I'll find something.
			Keep up your end. Stay awake.
			That's an order, Doctor.
			A shot in the dark is better than
			nothing. Let's see if we can get
			lucky.
			I can't seem to pin down the
			pattern...
			Sorry, sir. I should have seen
			that.
			It's all right. You are doing
			fine.
			Program laid in, sir. Phasers and
			photon torpedoes ready.
			Bring her about to two-three mark
			one-eight-five.
			Aye, sir.
			Fire!
			Phasers and photons firing.
			We missed.
			Number four shield buckling.
			Number three shield nearing
			failure.
			Bridge, this is Engineering. I
			can't hold this power level much
			longer.
			Backup systems are overloaded.
			Backup systems failing.
			Bridge, this is Engineering. Tell
			me something.
			Mister Logan, report to the bridge.
			On my way.
			Deflectors are breaking down.
			We have less than one minute of
			reserve.
			We are getting out of here.
			Ensign T'su - set course. Three-one-five...
			mark zero-seven.
			Course set.
			You are leaving them on that
			planet?
			Speed warp five.
			Warp five - aye.
			Engage.
			Hold course and speed for twenty-eight
			seconds, then come to a full
			stop.
			If we stay, we'll be destroyed.
			There are over a thousand people
			on the ship -- I have a
			responsibility to them.
			What about your responsibility
			to Captain Picard and the members
			of the away team?
			We have a responsibility to them
			as well. Mister Logan, you are
			going to take command...
			... of the Saucer Section. Bridge
			crew - prepare to move to the
			Battle Bridge.
			You're going to separate?
			Yes. I want you to take the
			Saucer Section and proceed
			immediately for Starbase
			One-zero-three.
			You still won't be able to see
			that device.
			There are ways.
			Risky.
			That's why we are going to
			separate.
			Worf, Solis, T'su. You're with
			me on the Battle Bridge. Good
			luck, Mister Logan.
			Commander -- here. There seem
			to be air shafts overgrown with
			vegetation. Perhaps they somehow
			fell through one of them.
			Clear some of that away.
			If Data's calculations are
			correct, the next sphere should
			show itself in two minutes.
			{He starts to give a sales pitch
			to Picard. It tells Picard about
			the machine. Picard realizes that
			these people have created a nearly
			perfect killing system. The spy
			at the beginning, and all of these
			devices which are capable of
			learning and improving.}
			You poor fools. The first time
			you tested it, or demonstrated
			it... something went wrong and
			your creation destroyed you.
			What was that noise?
			{Another (something from the model
			number... ) is about to clear.
			Something about the demonstration.
			that it is another one of the
			devices going to the surface.}
			Can you stop it?
			Why would I want to do that? It
			can't demonstrate its abilities
			unless it leaves the nest.
			Captain... can you hear me?
			Yes -- we're here.
			Are you all right?
			Doctor Crusher has been seriously
			injured. Our communicators are
			out and I haven't been able to
			contact the Enterprise.
			Yes, we are in the same fix. Is
			there a way to get down to you?
			None that I know of. Number One,
			those devices are part of a system
			which is located down here.
			Another is about to be released.
			We know, Captain.
			It's too far. There is nothing
			to hold onto... no way to climb
			down.
			I'm surprised either of them
			survived.
			Commander, I can do it.
			How?
			Jump.
			It's over ten meters.
			Eleven point seven five.
			Data, you're sturdy, but you're
			not indestructible.
			I believe I can safely traverse
			the distance.
			Captain -- Data is coming down to
			join you.
			Be my guest.
			Data!
			At your service, Captain.
			Prepare to initiate separation
			sequence.
			All decks report ready.
			Begin separation.
			Separation complete, sir.
			Lian -- lay in a course for Minos --
			warp five.
			Course set.
			Engage.
			We had better find a defensive
			position. If Data's right --
			And he usually is.
			We're going to have company in
			thirty seconds. And this time...
			I don't know how we're going to
			stop it.
			Shields and deflectors are up.
			When I order the shields down,
			you have one responsibility.
			Locate the away team and get them
			up here. You may only have a few
			seconds.
			Approaching the planet, sir.
			The ride's going to get a little
			bumpy. Things are going to happen
			fast.
			Just keep alert... stay calm...
			and focus on the task at hand.
			You know your jobs.
			You've been trained, you've been
			tested, and you've earned the
			right to sit in those chairs.
			Another weapon has been launched.
			We have to find a way to stop this
			system.
			I need to see the program
			schematic.
			You got it.
			Is it possible to re-adjust the
			targeting sequence?
			Absolutely. They wouldn't be
			much good if you couldn't.
			Data, assign it a neutral target.
			The target must be specific.
			Itself, then. Have it track
			itself or the power source that
			manufactures it.
			The force of that explosion would
			destroy this chamber and evervone
			near by.
			Watch now - the Echo-Papa, Series
			Six-oh-seven is about to complete
			this phase of its mission.
			Got any ideas?
			None.
			Give me some options, Data...
			Quickly.
			Why don't you just shut it off?
			Is that possible?
			Why not -- it's a machine, isn't
			it?
			Shut it off.
			But, you haven't seen half of
			what this beauty can do.
			We've seen enough.
			Does that mean you are going to
			buy it?
			If that's what it takes to shut
			it off. Yes... I've seen enough --
			you've made a sale.
			You won't be sorry.
			Now... end the demonstration.
			Done.
			Number One!
			Here, sir. That was close.
			Lieutenant La Forge.
			It's great to hear your voice,
			Captain. We're a little busy
			right now. I'll get right back
			to you.
			Phasers at full readiness.
			Keep those shields at full power.
			It'll be on us any moment.
			Shields holding.
			Ahead one-quarter, heading
			two-five mark three-zero-zero.
			That heading will take us further
			into the planet's atmosphere.
			That's correct.
			We're going to lose some
			maneuverability, so keep a firm
			hand on the helm.
			Aye, sir.
			You want our attacker to follow
			us into the atmosphere...
			That's what I'm hoping.
			Scan for any air disruption or
			vortex -- cloak or no cloak,
			we'll spot it by its turbulence.
			How fast will you be able to get
			a phaser lock?
			Just watch me.
			Hull temperature one thousand
			degrees and rising.
			Emergency power to deflectors.
			Velocity increasing, sir.
			Steady as she goes.
			Hull temperature twenty-five
			hundred degrees.
			Deflectors nearing overload.
			Helm is growing unresponsive, sir.
			Can you compensate?
			Yes, sir, I can.
			Hull three thousand degrees.
			Maintain heading.
			Thirty-three hundred degrees.
			Number four deflector inoperative.
			Turbulence to starboard!
			Scanners locked --
			Weapons locked!
			Fire!
			Got him!
			Come to four-zero mark six-five,
			ahead one-third, and assume
			standard orbit.
			Locked onto life-forms and ready
			to beam them up.
			Excellent. Energize.
			Ensign T'su -- lay in a course
			to rendezvous with the Saucer
			Section.
