			Captain's log, stardate 41636.9.
			As feared, our examination of the
			seven year overdue Federation
			freighter, Odin -- disabled by
			an asteroid collision -- revealed
			no survivors.
			However, three escape pods were
			missing, suggesting the
			possibility of survivors...
			Ready to begin orbit of Angel One,
			Captain.
			Make it so, Mister La Forge. What
			kind of place is this, Data?
			Angel One is a class M planet,
			supporting carbon-based flora and
			fauna, sparsely populated with
			intelligent life forms... similar
			in technological development to
			mid-twentieth-century Earth.
			Just like being marooned at home.
			Assuming any survivors made it
			this far. Admittedly, it's the
			closest planet to the Odin. But
			the distance we've traveled in the
			past two days at warp one would've
			taken the Odin escape pods five
			months.
			Five months, fourteen days, eleven
			hours, two minutes --
			Thank you, Data.
			-- and fifty-seven seconds.
			Captain, we're receiving an audio
			signal from Angel One.
			Starfleet was quite adamant that
			we maintain excellent diplomatic
			relations with this planet. Any
			other pertinent information before
			we reply, Mister Data? Their form
			of government would be a logical
			starting place.
			Angel One has evolved into a
			constitutional oligarchy. It is
			governed by a parliamentary body
			consisting of six elected
			Mistresses, and headed by a female
			they refer to as "The Elected
			One."
			It sounds very much like my own
			planet.
			Klingons appreciate strong women.
			How current is your information,
			Data?
			A Federation vessel last visited
			this planet sixty-two years ago,
			Captain.
			Except, let us hope, for the Odin
			escape pods.
			Since this is a female-dominated
			society, it might be more prudent
			if you made the initial contact,
			Counselor.
			Please open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			This is Counselor Deanna Troi of
			the USS Enterprise.
			I am Beata, The Elected One. How
			may we assist you, Counselor?
			The Federation has neglected a
			visit to your planet for far too
			long. With your permission, we
			would like to correct that
			oversight.
			We feel in no way neglected,
			Counselor. A diplomatic courtesy
			call is neither expected nor
			required.
			We also come in search of possible
			survivors from one of our
			freighters.
			A brief visit will be tolerated.
			They've broken off transmission.
			Ever feel like you're not really
			wanted?
			That's their prerogative,
			Lieutenant.
			Prepare the away team, Number One.
			Aye, aye, sir.
			Where're you boys off to?
			Skiing, sir. Our instructor has
			us scheduled for the Swiss Alps,
			sir.
			Save us some deep powder.
			No problem, sir. The Holodeck
			has all you'll ever need.
			The away team is ready, Captain.
			Angel One's position in this
			quadrant may become strategically
			vital. The hope at Starfleet is
			that some day this planet could
			become a part of the Federation.
			We'll try to make a good impression,
			Captain.
			Energize!
			See that these matters are handled
			immediately.
			As you wish, Mistress.
			I am Beata, The Elected One of
			Angel One.
			Mistress Beata, I am Counselor
			Troi.
			We've brought you a small token
			of our goodwill.
			My cooperation is not for sale,
			Counselor.
			We didn't mean to imply that it
			was, Mistress.
			Out of respect to your wishes that
			we keep our visit brief, perhaps
			you would like to address the
			issue of survivors immediately.
			Immediately -- but not
			impetuously. You will present
			your case.
			Until I am certain of your
			intentions, I know of no such
			survivors.
			Representatives of the Starship
			Enterprise -- do you wish to
			petition the Parliament of Angel
			One?
			We do. We have reason to hope
			that survivors from a damaged
			Federation freighter may be
			marooned on your planet. We are
			seeking to learn if this is so.
			Even a planet as remote as Angel
			One has heard of Starfleet.
			Searching the galaxy for survivors
			seems a petty task for one of their
			mighty vessels.
			We don't consider even one
			survivor petty.
			Is this man suggesting that we
			place a lesser value on life than
			you do?
			Not at all.
			Our discovery of the abandoned
			freighter was an accident,
			Mistress Beata. We have a duty
			to investigate.
			I see. And if you were to find
			survivors? What then?
			We will take them with us. See
			that they are reunited with their
			families.
			Mistress Beata... ?
			Yes, Ariel?
			Are we to take these strangers
			at their word?
			A good question.
			What reason could we possibly have
			to deceive you?
			Another good question.
			Are there survivors from the
			freighter Odin on this planet?
			After we discuss that matter,
			we'll let you know.
			See to their comforts.
			You will remain here until
			summoned.
			Are we able to talk? Is the
			area secure?
			Yes. Tricorder doesn't show
			any listening devices or
			anything else of a threatening
			nature
			Good. Troi?
			There was much fear in that room.
			Paranoia, if you ask me. But of
			what?
			I cannot say. Nor do I feel their
			fear was focused. I sensed that
			all were not concerned for the
			same reason.
			Data?
			There are undoubtedly survivors
			from the Odin on this planet,
			Commander.
			I agree. Otherwise, why would
			they be so circumspect?
			As the Mistress Beata is so fond
			of saying -- good question.
			What do we do if they elect to
			deny the existence of any
			survivors?
			Let's not look for problems.
			I want all departments prepared
			for a warp six trip to the Neutral
			Zone as soon as the away team
			completes its mission.
			Trouble, Captain?
			Insurance. Romulan battlecruisers
			have been detected near one of
			our border posts. They've
			requested assistance as soon as
			we are available.
			Captain Picard!
			Report, Mister Crusher.
			We, ah, finished our ski lesson,
			sir... and it kinda just happened,
			sir.
			On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher,
			nothing "just happens."
			What is that smell?
			Hmm, yes... slightly reminiscent
			of Night-Blooming Throgni,
			Captain. From home.
			Quite stimulating, wouldn't you
			say?
			No.
			I can't smell anything. I'm
			a little congested...
			Don't let this "just happen"
			again, Mister Crusher.
			Yes, sir!!
			Interesting. An alcohol-based
			synthetic, artificially
			reproducing a floral scent.
			It is called perfume, Data.
			The purpose of which is... ?
			Certain cultures consider perfume
			an aphrodisiac.
			I am unfamiliar with that term.
			An aphrodisiac is something
			designed to stimulate or enhance
			sexual pleasure.
			How does stimulation of the
			olfactory nerve affect the
			enjoyment of sex?
			The Elected One will see you now.
			You claim you intend to remove
			these survivors from our planet.
			Are you prepared to give us your
			solemn word on that?
			We are.
			You should know that the vote was
			not unanimous. Some among us are
			suspicious.
			Yet, the majority feel that we
			have no choice but to trust you.
			We don't understand the source
			of your misgivings, Mistress, but
			we appreciate your faith in us.
			Make certain that our faith has
			not been misplaced.
			There are four survivors from the
			ship you call the Odin. All male.
			Their leader is a man who calls
			himself Ramsey.
			If you'll bring these men to us,
			we'll have them off your planet
			immediately.
			If they were mine to deliver, I
			would do so without hesitation.
			Unfortunately, their hiding place
			has long eluded us.
			Hiding place? Why are they in
			hiding?
			Because they are fugitives on
			Angel One! And the sooner we are
			rid of them, the better!
			When these men arrived seven years
			ago, they accepted our hospitality
			quickly enough. But gradually,
			they grew restive. Making
			unreasonable demands, going
			against the natural order -- there
			seemed to be no end to the trouble
			they created.
			Using the technology of the
			Enterprise, we might be able to
			find these men.
			I assumed as much. But be warned,
			Counselor --
			-- these men are dangerous.
			This is worse than Hesperan
			Thumping Cough. What is it, Mom?
			You and your friend probably
			picked up something on the Quazulu
			Eight field trip last week.
			Whatever it is may have been
			activated by your exposure to the
			cold ski environment of the
			Holodeck.
			But the transporter biofilter is
			supposed to kill stuff like that.
			If this is our first contact, it
			wouldn't have been programmed into
			the biofilter computer yet.
			Mom...
			Sickbay to Captain Picard.
			Picard here.
			Wesley and one of his friends have
			contracted some form of
			respiratory ailment -- most likely
			a viral infection.
			Is it contained?
			I believe so. I've isolated the
			twelve students who were on the
			field trip where I believe the
			problem began.
			How contagious is it?
			Unknown. Nor do I have a clue
			as to how it's transmitted.
			Please stay with it, Doctor.
			Starfleet has important business
			for us as soon as the away team
			returns. I don't relish having my
			crew infected.
			At the moment, my only suggestion
			is that all crew avoid any
			cold-weather Holodeck simulations
			until further notice.
			Agreed. And keep me advised.
			Data, how can we best go about
			finding Mister Ramsey and the
			other survivors?
			Assuming the survivors have
			retained some remnants of their
			lives aboard the Odin, we might
			not have a difficult task. If
			we can isolate something unique
			to the survivors -- perhaps an
			element not otherwise found on
			Angel One -- we can utilize the
			Enterprise scanners.
			Mister Data will need access to
			your library.
			Our library is far too
			sophisticated for a man to
			comprehend.
			I am an android, Mistress, though
			anatomically, I am a fully
			functioning male.
			An amusing notion. Perhaps you
			could teach our males a thing or
			two.
			Trent -- see to the android's
			needs.
			Do not forget your promise.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead, Lieutenant.
			The away team has requested that
			we scan the planet surface for
			traces of platinum.
			Have Mister La Forge break fixed
			orbit and initiate a search
			pattern.
			Aye, Captain.
			Geordi.
			Search pattern initiated now.
			This is all quite unnecessary,
			Doctor.
			I'm merely fatigued.
			Because you are very ill, Captain.
			You have the virus.
			Captain, in my opinion, you are
			no longer physically able to
			effectively command this vessel.
			Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. I've
			got an away team down there, in
			less-than-friendly territory, not
			to mention an appointment with the
			several Romulan battlecruisers...
			You have an appointment in your
			cabin, Captain. With your bed.
			Is that an order?
			Yes.
			I guess I'm better at giving
			orders than taking them.
			I think I may sneeze...
			A Klingon sneeze?!
			Only kind I know.
			Lieutenant La Forge -- you have
			command until further notice.
			Please make the proper entries
			in the ship's log.
			Aye, sir.
			Scanners indicate a platinum
			trace. Should I notify the away
			team?
			Make it so.
			The Enterprise reports a possible
			location for Mister Ramsey and
			the other survivors.
			So soon? I'm impressed with your
			haste.
			I am suspicious of it.
			You've had your opportunity to
			object, Ariel. You were in the
			minority.
			Excuse me, Mistress. I have
			matters to attend to elsewhere.
			With your permission, we'd like
			to begin our search immediately.
			By all means.
			But I'm sure that Counselor Troi
			and the others can do that without
			you.
			If I recall, you had a gesture
			of goodwill you wished to give
			me... ?
			That can certainly wait until
			we've recovered the survivors.
			Are you suggesting that the women
			in your party are incapable of
			performing this task without the
			help of a man?
			Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and
			Counselor Troi are completely
			qualified.
			How generous you are with your
			praise.
			Inform them you will remain here
			with me.
			Riker to Lieutenant Yar.
			This is Yar.
			Tasha - you'll be leading the team
			without me.
			Commander... ?
			In the interest of diplomatic
			relations, I'll remain with
			Mistress Beata while you conduct
			your search.
			Certainly, sir.
			Relax. We have much to discuss.
			Set phasers to stun.
			Is that really necessary?
			A justified precaution, Counselor.
			Mistress Beata observed that
			Mister Ramsey and his men were
			dangerous.
			Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Tasha.
			Three to beam to the location of
			that platinum trace, Geordi.
			Coordinates set.
			Energize!
			Welcome. I've been expecting you.
			Picard to bridge.
			Pardon me.
			La Forge here, Captain.
			Status report, please.
			Eighty-two more reported cases
			of the virus, sir. Doctor Crusher
			has converted the Holodeck into
			an isolation ward.
			And the --
			-- away team?
			No recent contact, Captain. But
			I've informed them of the medical
			situation up here and the growing
			Romulan threat to our Neutral Zone
			outpost.
			Keep me--
			--advised. You'll have the bridge
			until Commander Riker returns.
			Engineering reports a computer
			malf...
			Sorry, I'm... getting sick.
			I'm sure half the ship knows that
			by now. Report to Sickbay.
			Engineering to bridge.
			La Forge here.
			Sir, the computer won't accept
			the variant climate controls
			Doctor Crusher wants in the
			quarantine areas.
			I'm on my way.
			With all respect, Lieutenant,
			there are other people to do that
			job now.
			bridge to Engineering. Lieutenant
			Wong knows the system. I'm sure
			she'll be able to resolve all
			problems.
			I'll ask her to look at it right
			away, sir.
			Worf...
			Thanks for the advice.
			We haven't much time, Mister
			Ramsey. The Enterprise has urgent
			business elsewhere.
			Certainly we have time for a
			drink.
			How did you find me?
			Actually, it was quite simple.
			I accessed all possible elements
			available to the crew of the Odin,
			cross-referenced those to elements
			endemic to Angel One, then
			eliminated the common
			denominators. Angel One has no
			platinum. Enterprise scanners
			did the rest.
			Platinum, was it?
			My wings. I kept them for their
			sentimental value.
			Where are the other survivors,
			Mister Ramsey?
			Oh, they're nearby. Packing, as
			a matter of fact, since we can
			no longer remain here. As the
			unofficial leader of our little
			group, I've been chosen to speak
			for us all.
			Marooned seven years on an alien
			planet. Rather than excitement
			or anticipation at being rescued,
			I sense a feeling of calm in you.
			What is it you think you're
			rescuing me from? My shipmates
			and I have all taken wives. A
			few even have children. You can't
			"rescue" a man from the place he
			calls his home.
			... Why were you so hesitant at
			first to tell us about the Odin
			survivors?
			Simply because Ramsey and his men
			are anarchists. Tampering with
			the laws of nature. Obsessed with
			spreading untruths, and
			encouraging dissent among our
			people. I had to be certain you
			weren't here to fuel their
			struggle.
			It's not our place to interfere
			in the domestic affairs of other
			societies.
			Not you, perhaps, because you
			understand a man's place. But
			Ramsey is not so well-mannered.
			Sometimes I fear that it is
			actually the men who are the
			clever ones, enjoying all that
			life has to offer while we women
			devote ourselves to the drudgery
			of making life work.
			In our society, men and women
			share equally in all that life
			has to offer.
			Don't misunderstand me, Riker.
			I'd be the last to imply that men
			are in any way inferior to women.
			But, after all, men are... men --
			with a natural place in the scheme
			of things.
			We gave up those distinctions
			centuries ago. In our world,
			equality among the sexes is so
			well established, we no longer
			consider it an issue.
			You deny that differences exist
			between men and women?
			We not only acknowledge the
			differences. We delight in them.
			That's so like a man. So
			emotional. What would we do
			without you... ?
			Thank you, Trent.
			You may go.
			With compliments of the USS
			Enterprise.
			It's called an Albeni meditation
			crystal.
			Very impressive.
			And now, of course, I must repay
			you in kind.
			... Five months in a rescue pod
			no bigger than this room is an
			eternity I hope none of you ever
			have to face. When we finally
			made it here, we all thought we'd
			died and gone to heaven. You've
			seen the women of the planet --
			tall and strong and lovely.
			But once the newness wore off,
			we started to see how men on this
			planet were treated. No vote,
			no opinions... no respect.
			None of which is any longer your
			concern, Mister Ramsey. Call the
			others in, please. It's time to
			leave.
			Despite its problems, Lieutenant,
			we like it here on Angel One.
			We're not going anywhere.
			But Mistress Beata --
			Mistress Beata be damned! Her
			wish is not my command. And
			neither is yours. You can't force
			us to go.
			Mister Ramsey is correct,
			Counselor. The Odin was not a
			starship, which means its crew
			is not bound by the Prime
			Directive. If he and the other
			survivors wish to stay here, there
			is absolutely nothing we can do.
			Bridge to Sickbay -- how are you
			Doing, Doctor?
			We have more sick than we do beds.
			I've been forced to confine over
			three hundred to their private
			quarters.
			We're going to be seriously
			undermanned if we're forced to
			engage the Romulans in battle.
			The Romulans are your problem,
			Lieutenant. Trying to find an
			innoculant is mine. This virus
			mutates every twenty minutes.
			On the positive side, the virus
			is debilitating -- but so far we
			haven't had any fatalities.
			If this continues, there'll be
			no one left to run the ship.
			If it continues, no one will be
			healthy enough to care.
			Lieutenant Yar to Enterprise.
			Enterprise, go ahead.
			Prepare to beam three back to our
			previous location, Geordi. After
			we regroup with Commander Riker,
			we'll return to the ship.
			Suggest you make that on the
			double. We have a real medical
			emergency brewing up here. A
			third of the crew is down. And
			the latest report from the Neutral
			Zone outpost is that more Romulan
			battlecrusiers are entering the
			area.
			I'll inform the commander.
			One thing before we go. You said
			you were expecting us. Why?
			I'm sorry. I can't tell you.
			We wish you well, Mister Ramsey.
			Energize!
			They are gone.
			It is such a refreshing change
			to be with a man who knows what
			he wants.
			You mean without a woman having
			to tell him?
			Exactly! I knew you were bright
			enough to understand. Women, by
			our very nature, want only what
			is best for their men.
			Men are not objects to be
			possessed, Mistress Beata.
			Of course they're not. It was
			merely a figure of speech.
			Enter.
			Why do you bother me?
			Forgive the disturbance, Elected
			One...
			I expect so little from this sorry
			excuse for a man. Perhaps even
			that much is too much...
			What is so important you find it
			necessary to intrude on my
			privacy?
			They have returned, Mistress.
			But without Ramsey or the others.
			Your advanced technology has
			proven inadequate?
			What happened, Troi?
			Mister Ramsey and the other
			survivors refuse to leave.
			But you promised!
			I'm sorry. There's nothing else
			we can do.
			I am sorry as well.
			Since you refuse to take them with
			you, I am left with no choice...
			but to sentence them all to death.
			Enter.
			It looks horrible, tastes worse --
			but it's absolutely guaranteed to
			make you feel better.
			Knew you'd like it.
			New cologne?
			Same... you gave me last birthday.
			Uh-uh, different. Like something
			I smelled earlier. Something...
			I don't know... like a flower I
			remember. Something Klingon, I
			think.
			Lieutenant Worf and I... detected
			a similar scent when we bumped
			into... your son at the Holodeck.
			It's that smell! That must be
			how the virus travels!
			An airborne microbe whose sweet
			scent inspires deep inhalation...
			... And once inside the body,
			becomes this damned virus!
			I have a great deal of work to
			do.
			You are excused, Doctor.
			What's the latest on the
			Enterprise's medical situation?
			Doctor Crusher feels the virus
			will undoubtedly run unchecked
			through the entire ship's
			contingent. Attempts to develop
			an innoculant have so far ended
			in failure. Lieutenant La Forge
			still has the Conn pending your
			return.
			What about the Romulans in the
			Neutral Zone?
			The border outpost reports a
			contingent of seven Romulan
			battlecruisers within sensor
			range. The USS Berlin has
			answered their distress call, and
			is standing by. However, should
			hostilities erupt, the outpost
			and the starship will be
			outgunned. It is felt that the
			Enterprise's presence in the area
			will be a vital show of force.
			Some show of force. The
			Enterprise may be able to fly on
			autopilot. But with that virus
			knocking down our crew, we're
			going to be in sorry shape if
			things turn ugly.
			The Romulans won't know our
			strength, Lieutenant.
			It's time for us to leave this
			place.
			It feels terribly wrong to leave
			while Beata is determined to
			execute those people.
			She has to find them first.
			Ramsey and his bunch have been
			fugitives for years. I suspect
			he's pretty good at evading
			capture. As cold as it sounds
			we're going to have to treat this
			mission as if it never happened.
			Everything will remain exactly
			as it was before we arrived.
			Something is wrong.
			Your presence on Angel One no
			longer amuses me.
			Amusement was never our intention,
			Mistress.
			Before you go back to your ship,
			there is something I wish you to
			see.
			We were no harm to anyone. Why
			did you tell them where to find
			us?
			Don't blame them, Ramsey. You
			brought this upon yourself.
			You... and the traitor.
			One doesn't need the technology
			of the Enterprise to follow
			Mistress Ariel sneaking off to
			warn her husband.
			Let her stand with him now...
			... For tomorrow they will die
			together.
			You're out of commission, Geordi.
			Report to your quarters.
			Can't leave my post... until I'm
			relieved.
			I've been aboard the Enterprise
			long enough to know she's designed
			to run herself.
			But the innoculant --
			I can do my research on the
			computers here.
			Then I can convalesce here.
			You claim to be an advanced
			society, yet you resort to tyranny
			and executions in order to
			suppress those who don't share
			your views.
			I don't expect you to understand.
			Why? Because I'm only a man?
			You'll accomplish nothing with
			that attitude.
			Mistress Beata, if you could avoid
			executing Ramsey and his
			followers, would you do so?
			Is that not the way of an advanced
			society?
			Then let us talk to men from the
			Odin one last time. Let me try
			to convince them to leave with
			us.
			But what of the others? Their
			minds have been poisoned. Will
			you also include those from this
			planet who unwisely chose to
			follow Ramsey and his group?
			Yes. All of them.
			Mistress Beata is giving you a
			second chance. We're prepared
			to take your entire group with
			us.
			That's very kind of you, sir, but
			we're not going.
			Haven't you been paying attention,
			Ramsey? You're scheduled to be
			executed tomorrow.
			We don't want to die. We don't
			want to leave, either. I'm not
			Academy educated, but I've studied
			a little history. The ancient
			Christians faced their lions, the
			natives of the African continent
			faced their suppressors.
			Even the women of the twentieth century
			chose to settle for nothing but
			full equality.
			There's no time to debate the
			issues, Ramsey. We're taking you
			with us whether you choose to go
			or not.
			Excuse me, Commander, but removing
			any of these people against their
			will would be a violation of
			several Starfleet regulations,
			not the least of which would be
			the Prime Directive.
			I realize that, Data.
			But I'd rather be facing a court
			martial than trying to live with
			the guilt of leaving these people
			to their deaths.
			Commander Riker to Enterprise.
			This is the Enterprise.
			Things must be worse up there than
			we thought.
			Doctor, where is Lieutenant La
			Forge?
			He's right here, Will, but he's
			in no shape to be here.
			We're on our way, Doctor.
			There'll be fourteen to beam up.
			Two groups, five each. I'll be
			in the last group of four.
			I'm afraid I can't allow that,
			Will. The virus is totally out
			of control. Until I know exactly
			what I'm dealing with, I can't
			let anyone new be exposed.
			There are people facing certain
			death down here, Doctor.
			They could well be facing the same
			thing up here, Will. I have no
			idea what effect living on Angel
			One might have on a person's
			immune system. I'm sorry.
			Understood.
			Doctor -- would this virus have
			any effect on Data?
			None that I can imagine.
			You're going back alone, Data.
			We have no idea what the Romulans
			plan to do to that outpost.
			You're going to have to get the
			Enterprise to the Neutral Zone
			before it's too late.
			That's a direct order, Mister Data.
			Neutral Zone before it is too
			late. Understood, Commander.
			This is Data, standing by to beam
			up.
			And what of them?
			I don't know, Deanna.
			Mistress Beata invites you to
			witness this morning's
			reaffirmation of Angel One's moral
			imperative.
			Is that supposed to be the fancy
			name for murder on this planet?
			Send Mistress Beata our regrets.
			The Elected One will not look
			fondly upon --
			Enterprise to Commander Riker.
			They are still here?
			This is Commander Riker.
			I gave you a direct order to head
			for the Neutral Zone immediately.
			Explain the delay.
			To be precise, Commander, you
			ordered me to reach the Neutral
			Zone "before it is too late."
			I have computed the length of time
			the border outpost and USS Berlin
			can safely withstand a Romulan
			attack... deducted our time to
			destination at maximum warp speed.
			That leaves Doctor Crusher with
			forty-eight more minutes to
			complete her research and develop
			an innoculant to the virus.
			Which means there's still time
			for us to do something.
			Forty-eight minutes... I think
			we're down to splitting hairs.
			Splitting hairs is a figure of
			speech I recognize, Commander.
			Speaking for those whose hair is
			soon to be split, forty-eight
			minutes may make a great deal of
			difference.
			Excuse me -- forty-seven minutes.
			Perhaps, Data, just perhaps.
			Thanks for following my orders
			so precisely, Data. Riker out.
			On second thought, Trent, we would
			be honored to watch your moral
			imperative in action.
			Sickbay to bridge.
			Go ahead, Doctor.
			Bingo, Data.
			Bingo? I fail to see the
			relevance, Doctor. Is that not
			a reference to an ancient Earth
			game?
			It's also a reference to success,
			Data. I've got the innoculant.
			Excellent, Doctor. And we still
			have a margin of seventeen
			minutes. I will inform the away
			team immediately.
			Enterprise to Commander Riker.
			We are ready to have you beamed
			up, Commander.
			Data, I want you to lock the
			transporter on the holding area
			where they're keeping Ramsey and
			the others. If we don't hear from
			Beata in the next ten minutes,
			you are to begin the beam up
			sequence, five at a time. The
			away team will beam up last.
			Understood, Commander. Enterprise
			out.
			The Elected One wishes to see you.
			Welcome home.
			It's good to be back. Is everyone
			recovering?
			Slowly... but yes.
			Enter.
			How are you feeling, sir?
			On the mend, thank you. Tell me
			about Angel One.
			Set coordinates for the Neutral
			Zone, Mister Data. We have a call
			to pay on the Romulans.
			Coordinates set, Commander. On
			your mark --
			As Captain Picard would say --
			make it so, Mister Data.
