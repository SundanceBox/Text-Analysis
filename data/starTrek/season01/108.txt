			Captain's log, stardate 41249.3.
			We have orbited the two major
			planets of the Beta Renner system
			taking aboard delegates from
			those two worlds. Since achieving
			space flight, their major life
			forms, the Anticans and the
			Selay...
			... have become deadly enemies.
			But both have also applied for
			admission into our Federation.
			We are to deliver these
			delegates to this sector's neutral
			Conference Planet called
			"Parliament" in the hope their
			dispute can be resolved.
			I am Captain Picard. We hope
			to make this journey pleasant
			and comfortable. Arranging
			that will be my first officer,
			Commander Riker.
			Welcome aboard. If you'll follow
			me...
			... I'll show you the
			accommodations we've...
			We can already smell the Anticans.
			They were taken aboard first?
			Only because their world was the
			first on our heading to
			Parliament.
			Will our quarters be near the
			Anticans?
			About one hundred meters apart.
			Is that all right?
			No. Unsatisfactory.
			I believe we can accommodate their
			wishes, Captain.
			We'll rearrange suite assignments.
			If you'll follow me?
			And we must be upwind from the
			Anticans.
			Of course, sir...
			Neither seem very promising
			Federation candidates.
			Even Parliament's peacemakers may
			find this case difficult.
			Do you understand the basis of
			all that nonsense between them?
			No sir. I didn't understand that
			kind of hostility even when I
			studied Earth history.
			Oh? Well, yes, but these life
			forms feel such passionate hatred
			over differences in customs, God
			concepts, and even strangely enough,
			economic systems...
			Sir, my sensors are picking up
			an unusual energy object ahead.
			On screen.
			Confirmed, sir. My sensors read
			nothing solid but considerable
			energy in...
			... in changing patterns.
			Traveling at warp speed, too.
			Intriguing.
			I can find no match with anything
			in our records, sir.
			Change course for a close sensor
			pass... we'll then increase warp
			speed to reach Parliament on
			schedule.
			Aye, sir.
			Why the interest in this, Worf?
			It is just routine maintenance
			on the sensor assemblies.
			Simple, Geordi. Our captain
			wants his junior officers to
			learn, learn, learn...
			Not just the junior ones.
			Okay, hold this relay off-line
			while...
			Security to Sensor Maintenance.
			La Forge here.
			We're making a close sensor pass
			on an unusual object, Geordi.
			Any problems?
			None, Lieutenant. All equipment
			on line and functioning.
			Sensors ready, sir.
			Life form reading?
			No life form reading, sir.
			Begin the pass.
			Sir, it is changing shape... !
			Any readings indicating matter
			there?
			Negative, Captain. Energy only.
			La Forge to Sickbay. Medical
			emergency in Sensor Maintenance
			Room!
			Repeat -- medical emergency!
			What happened?
			Don't know. It seemed like he
			was hit by...
			... some sensor feedback, maybe.
			Lieutenant Worf?
			Lieutenant, can you hear what I'm
			saying?
			Let's get him up.
			He was just monitoring the sensor
			console when he jerked as though
			something hit him. What my
			sensors showed...
			... It was kind of a... glow... just
			for a second. I can't explain it.
			Could your VISOR device have
			malfunctioned?
			Doubt it, sir. It seemed what
			I was seeing was something real.
			I'm going to give you something
			to help you rest. Just relax.
			Fortunately, he's stronger than
			an orbital tug. There's nothing
			physically wrong with him. What
			have you sensed?
			Nothing... which bothers me. He
			has never shielded his feelings
			from me. I can't understand why
			he is suddenly doing it now.
			Are you able to perceive anything
			at all, Counselor? It may be
			important.
			Perhaps... very faintly.
			Almost... like a frightened
			child.
			Worf "frightened?"
			It doesn't make much sense but...
			Yes, it's fear. Definitely there.
			Sorry to call you, sir, not
			strictly security, it's about
			the dietary requirements of the
			Antican delegates.
			I thought that had been taken care
			of in advance, Tasha.
			So did we, sir. Their live
			animals were beamed aboard -- We
			were going to preserve the meat
			for them, but ....
			... they say we must bring it to
			them alive.
			Then do so!
			Lieutenant Yar was... confused.
			We no longer enslave animals
			for food purposes.
			But we have seen humans eat meat!
			You've seen something as fresh
			and tasty as living meat, but
			inorganically materialized out
			of patterns used by our
			transporters.
			How sickening! How barbaric!
			He's reading normal? How did you
			manage that?
			Yes... normal, now.
			Are you all right?
			Yes... perfectly.
			Yes... both of us quite normal.
			Where... where am I?
			Don't you remember? You were in
			the Sensor Maintenance Room ---
			I remember monitoring the sensor
			console -- and that's all. What
			am I doing here?
			That's a story the doctor will
			tell you.
			I called it a "cloud" for lack
			of a better term at the time.
			But the sensor pass shows it as
			much more. Combinations very
			complex, precise energy
			patterns...
			Constantly interacting on each
			other?
			Yes, sir... But whether
			individually or as a whole, it
			is difficult to say.
			Obviously, you seem to feel it
			should be inspected more closely.
			A mystery is only a mystery as
			long as it remains uninvestigated,
			sir.
			Ah. I love a mystery, Mister
			Data, but this one has to wait
			until we deliver the delegates
			to their peace conference on
			Parliament.
			Hi Mom. You're back early.
			Yes.
			Physical sciences class. We're
			studying Doctor Channing's theory
			on dilithium crystals.
			Tell me about it.
			Really? You never seemed that
			interested in warp theory before.
			Doctor Channing thinks it's
			possible to force dilithium into
			even more useful crystals. If
			as shown here, matter and
			antimatter could be aligned even
			more efficiently...
			Would that affect navigation?
			This is engineering, not helm
			control.
			Oh yes, the helm's located on the
			bridge.
			Mom, is something wrong?
			This... is the helm.
			Unless there have been some
			changes I don't know about.
			Doctor Crusher?
			You will wish to know Lieutenant
			Worf is much improved. Ready to
			report back on duty.
			What was the diagnosis?
			A temporary mental abberation.
			When it concerns a bridge officer,
			I expect a better explanation,
			Doctor.
			Then I must first run some
			crosschecks in the
			library-computer. Klingons are
			so unusual in their reactions,
			aren't they?
			Take Science Station Two, Doctor.
			Intriguing, Doctor. What does
			helm control have to do with
			medical crosschecks?
			I... I don't know why I'm...
			Is something wrong, Doctor?
			Doctor, are you all right?
			Yes... yes. I -- I'll do my work
			from my office. That's where I
			should be...
			Do you want someone to accompany
			you?
			Counselor, what's happening to
			my people?
			Captain? There is a malfunction
			in this station. I cannot bring
			any information up on it.
			Science Two does not function
			either, sir.
			Engineering to Captain Picard.
			We have something wrong with warp
			drive circuitry, sir.
			Transporter Room Six to bridge.
			Reporting transporter console
			malfunction, sir.
			Mister Data, this ship is less
			than a year out of spacedock.
			What are the chances of all this
			occurring?
			It is a virtual impossibility,
			sir.
			So what the hell is going on
			here?
			... I don't understand it,
			Gentlemen. I need information.
			You're telling me there is no
			explanation for any of these
			malfunctions?
			At least, sir, all department
			heads report the damage repaired.
			That was not the question, Number
			One. What caused the
			malfunctions?
			I believe it was a rampant
			electronic short that jumped from
			system to system, sir. The only
			thing is --
			Yes, Mister Singh?
			That shouldn't be possible. The
			affected systems don't generally
			interact with each other -- and
			where they do, it wasn't the
			interlink that was malfunctioning.
			Have you spoken with Chief
			Engineer Argyle about the problem?
			With all the engineering staff,
			sir. They're just as puzzled.
			I am not satisfied with that.
			I want explanations of this by
			the time we get to Parliament.
			But...
			By the time we get to
			Parliament, Mr. Singh.
			These weapons were removed
			from two of your people who were
			loitering out of sight in the
			vicinity of the Selay delegation
			quarters. Would you care to
			explain, sir?
			Those are not weapons, First
			Officer. They are tools we use
			to dispatch the animals we consume.
			Your food supply is not on the
			same deck as the Selay delegation,
			sir.
			And you will admit these "tools"
			can kill.
			Some of my people are impulsive.
			and we all have reason to hate
			the Selay.
			They appear to have the same
			feelings about you, sir.
			That is the nature of politics.
			Nonetheless, Chief Delegate, I'm
			putting you on notice that all
			weapons -- no matter what their
			basic function -- are being
			confiscated. Violence will not
			be tolerated on the Enterprise.
			Of course not. And if any does
			occur, I can assure you it will
			not be we Anticans who start it.
			Thank you, sir.
			But we will finish it.
			Sir, warp power is fading!
			Picard to Engineering. What is
			our problem?
			Warp five... four... three...
			two...
			We've lost the warp engine
			computer tie!
			And we just dropped below warp
			one, sir.
			Go to impulse power!
			State of the art vessel? Hah.
			Commander Data, signal Parliament
			that we will be delayed. We will
			send the new arrival time as soon
			as determined.
			Yes, sir.
			Sir, subspace radio is out.
			Your theories on the sudden
			vulnerability of these systems,
			gentlemen?
			If the Enterprise were really this
			fragile, sir, she never would have
			gotten out of spacedock.
			Therefore, her systems failures
			are not endemic to the ship, but
			are more likely the result of the
			actions of an unknown adversary.
			We have a saboteur aboard.
			I believe I said that.
			Gentlemen. The question now is,
			who. I can't believe it's one
			of our people.
			Agreed. Which leaves someone in
			either alien delegation. If the
			Ferengi bribed or bought even one
			of them, that's all that would
			be needed.
			Ferengi contacts have been
			detected on both Selay and Antica,
			sir.
			Can any of you suggest another
			solution?
			You're sounding like a private
			eye, sir.
			Query: private eye?
			A private consulting investigator
			who solves crimes.
			A most interesting occupation.
			In the world of fact, it is, Data.
			However in literature, criminal
			detection becomes a fascinating
			exercise.
			The immortal Sherlock Holmes would
			have an interesting view of our
			mystery, I believe.
			I'm sure, sir -- but I'm afraid
			we have to find our solution
			without History's Greatest
			Consulting Detective.
			Is it there, Mister Singh? If
			the control network breaks at that
			point...
			... it bleeds warp engine command
			off into dead ends.
			Excellent. I believe I can
			handle it from there, Mister Crusher.
			But, sir --
			Your schedule shows classwork now.
			Sorry.
			Yes, sir.
			But I don't learn nearly this much
			in school.
			I tend to agree. But the captain's
			orders on this are very clear.
			Solve any new problems today?
			I was starting to, maybe, but
			Mister Singh sent me off to class.
			Wes -- you're only an acting
			ensign.
			You have to let the commissioned
			officers do some of the work.
			Mom, listen. I've learned more
			than they understand. For
			example, on Channing's dilithium
			crystals theory I was telling you
			about...
			When did you tell me about that?
			This morning. Don't you remember?
			Honestly, I don't, Wes.
			You asked if the warp engines had
			to do with navigation, and I said --
			Why would I have said that?
			Mister Singh, the Captain wants --
			Engineering to bridge. Security
			alert!
			Picard.
			Lieutenant Worf, sir. I just found
			Mister Singh.... he's dead.
			Captain's log, stardate 41249.4.
			Assistant Chief Engineer Singh
			has been found dead in the Engine
			Room Office, cause unknown. We
			continue to run on impulse power.
			I want the autopsy as soon as
			possible, Doctor.
			Captain, I'm so sorry. To have
			one of our people die like this...
			First, let's find out how he died.
			Doctor?
			The autopsy is underway, sir.
			It could be... a word you're not
			to use...
			...murder. Status of
			investigation?
			Underway.
			Our best people.
			Sir, he may have been working
			there on restoring warp power.
			According to these readings, we
			could go back to warp speed now.
			But that wasn't the reading when
			I left.
			Singh probably repaired it just
			before he was killed.
			But he couldn't have fixed it from
			here, sir! The problems we saw
			were inside the engines!
			Who else could have corrected it,
			Wes?
			Inform the bridge of engine
			status.
			We now have warp capacity, sir.
			All power on line.
			Well done. Warp engines ready.
			On previous heading, warp factor
			six.
			I tolerate these questions,
			Lieutenant Yar, because I need
			this vessel to get us to
			Parliament. Your shipboard
			problems do not concern me.
			They should. Our delays are your
			delays.
			The peace conference will wait
			for us.
			I must ask where you were during
			this vessel's Earth hours of 1800
			last night and 0700 this morning.
			Eating.
			Sir, I'm talking about hours
			here...
			It was a large meal.
			And an interesting animal.
			You wanted me, Doctor?
			Yes, concerning your memory
			blackout.
			I still don't remember having one.
			The same thing happened to me.
			I want to try hypnosis on both
			of you. It may restore your
			memory as to what happened.
			I fear such things, but...
			Fear from you, Worf?
			One thing is clear... Almost all
			the "peace" delegates answered
			our questions with lies.
			Imprecise, Lieutenant. They
			omitted certain truths, which in
			itself tells us something.
			We can learn something from
			non-disclosure?
			Oh, indubitably, my good woman.
			It's something the Captain
			mentioned. Sherlock Holmes, which
			Data is obviously studying...
			Has studied, sir - every case.
			As Holmes would have pointed
			out... during the time in
			question, something was afoot!
			"Afoot?"
			While both sets of delegates say
			they were in their quarters, our
			crew locator sensed them passing
			here...
			... and here.
			But since they don't show where
			they went, we're still in the
			dark.
			On the contrary, dear colleague -
			on their return they drew medical
			supplies appropriate to the
			treatment of minor wounds and
			abrasions on these life forms.
			Which, leaves you with only one
			conclusion.
			Exactly. That they were too
			engaged in their own affairs to
			have disabled our ship and
			murdered the engineer. Given a
			choice, they'd rather kill each
			other than any of us. It's
			elementary my dear Riker...sir.
			Speaking of aberrant behavior...
			Beverly... can you hear me?
			Yes.
			I want you to go back in your mind
			to the moment when you first
			recall this sensation of memory
			loss. Please picture it exactly
			as it occurred.
			He's lying on the hospital bed
			sedated. I'm walking up to
			him... I---
			I -- I -- I --
			Gently...gently. How do you feel
			at this moment -- as you lean over
			him to take the specimen?
			I... feel... someone else...
			something else there too...
			Go on.
			I feel crowded. Not alone...
			get out. Get out of my mind!
			You said almost exactly the same
			thing -- as though there were
			something else inside you.
			-- Which confirms the feeling of
			duality that I sensed earlier in
			both of them.
			Why didn't you report it?
			Because, sir, I assumed at first
			it was the kind of duality we
			Betazoids feel in all of you.
			Even you, sir. When you approach
			a decision and ask yourself which
			way to go... who are you talking
			to?
			Your hypnotism revealed another
			form of duality?
			Yes, sir. I believe something
			invaded them.
			It seems the only possible
			conclusion.
			Data, let's proceed without the
			pipe.
			If you wish, sir...
			... but I ask if you take it as
			incontrovertible that it cannot
			be a family member or one of our
			crew?
			Yes. Very unlikely.
			Then our investigation was
			worthwhile, sir. We have eliminated
			both the delegates and all our
			regular ship's complement.
			What are you suggesting?
			I am referring to the Great
			Detective's credo, sir. I
			quote... "We must fall back on
			the old axiom that when other
			contingencies fail, whatever
			remains, however improbable, must
			be the truth."
			Wes, everything's fixed now.
			That engine computer net wasn't
			repaired, sir. It just suddenly
			became all right.
			It's the result that counts.
			What --- ?
			What is it?
			Helm control just went down.
			She won't respond.
			Bridge to Captain. You're needed
			here immediately.
			Wes, alert Engineering from your
			panel.
			Trying...
			Report.
			Helm is down, sir. The ship's
			running wild ---
			Sir, we dropped to impulse
			power --
			Sir... ? Are you all right? I
			thought I just saw ---
			I'm fine.
			Everything is fine now.
			Why the drop to impulse power,
			Lieutenant?
			The helm is suddenly
			malfunctioning, sir.
			Malfunctioning? You're wrong --
			Look again.
			Sir, I ---
			Mister La Forge?
			There's nothing wrong with the
			helm now. Everything is -- just
			as it should be, sir.
			In that case, make our heading
			two-nine-five mark three-seven.
			Sir... ?
			You have a problem with that
			heading, Lieutenant?
			Do you want to double back on our
			course, sir?
			That is what I've ordered.
			Captain... I'm puzzled about your
			reversing our course.
			The energy "cloud," Commander --
			I believe it important to have
			another look at it.
			Sir, we're behind schedule to
			Parliament already ---
			I believe a very important
			scientific discovery awaits us
			on this heading.
			Perhaps you'll share your
			reasoning on that, sir?
			Yes, since we obtained only
			minimal information on our sensor
			pass of it.
			We must go back to learn more.
			Counselor... do you believe a ship
			captain should explain every
			order?
			Of course not, sir.
			I demand to see the captain.
			Stop, return to your quarters... !
			What is that doing on our deck?
			I demand to know why this starship
			has changed course!
			Please return to your quarters,
			delegates!
			You're late and you asked for this
			confidential meeting.
			Sorry. I was just so troubled
			by my talk with the captain.
			Something seems wrong... terribly
			wrong.
			I believe I sense something
			... different in the Captain ... not
			much and maybe I'm incorrect.
			They think I may be.
			You could be reacting to the
			reverse course order.
			But that's our captain. It's not
			the first time he's done something
			unusual.
			A mere change of direction hardly
			justifies mutiny.
			Exactly what do you believe you're
			sensing?
			Exactly?
			It's difficult to put into
			words... just a feeling that
			he's, well... closed part of his
			mind to me.
			How can you tell there's something
			there that you can't feel?
			As I said... it's hard to say.
			I just feel the captain's become
			... perhaps dangerous.
			If he's dangerous...if...
			... he'd have to be relieved from
			command.
			Which you're allowed to do... but
			it's beaucoup trouble if you're
			wrong.
			And at this moment it is all pure
			speculation. He has done nothing
			to subject the Enterprise to
			danger.
			Besides, I'd need a medical log
			giving clear evidence of
			incapacity.
			You could do it without that
			problem...
			Only if all command officers
			agreed it vital to do so. But
			he's not showing overt unusual
			behavior.
			Ultimately he will, I believe...
			Commander, as second in command,
			it's still in your corner. I'll
			order medical and psychiatric
			exams... You'll have to back me
			up somehow.
			First Officer's log, stardate
			41249.5. As I believed, the
			senior command officers refused
			to relieve the captain from duty
			on such slender evidence.
			Yes?
			I'd like you to come to Sickbay
			for some examinations, Captain.
			Oh?
			I'll be glad to do that when I'm
			free.
			I'd like to conduct them now, sir.
			Why?
			What can I do for you, Number One?
			Sir, Counselor Troi has
			recommended the examinations.
			Same question. Why?
			It is my duty to inform the
			captain that we believe it
			possible that he is under some
			kind of alien influence
			which... may constitute a danger
			to this ship.
			I consider it equally possible
			that you two and the counselor
			are overworked, and possibly
			suffering hallucinations.
			This is an order... you're to
			arrange medical and psychiatric
			exams of both yourself and them.
			Doctor, you realize you're all
			acting strangely?
			I'm concerned that you've suddenly
			turned the ship away from...
			What's happened to your mind,
			Doctor? The search for knowledge
			is always our primary mission.
			I'm sorry but I'm too busy for
			this kind of nonsense. Must I
			call security to force you to
			report to Sickbay?
			What in hell... ?
			Sorry. Wrong species.
			Riker to security chief.
			Yar here.
			Security squad to the Engineering
			Deck. The Selays are playing hide
			and seek down here -- obviously
			with the Anticans --
			-- and it's a lethal game. I want
			them returned to their quarters
			under guard.
			Right away, sir.
			And are you... aware sir, the
			captain expects you to take a
			medical exam?
			I'll do it later.
			Come.
			What do you want?
			I have the results of the exams
			you ordered.
			You don't care to inspect them?
			Please, are you Jean-Luc?
			He is here.
			The Jean-Luc I know?
			And more.
			The "more" frightens me...
			And elates us. We wish you could
			understand the glorious adventures
			ahead.
			You and... ?
			Soon we'll both be home.
			First officer's log, supplemental.
			On the orders of... Captain
			Picard, we have returned to the
			vicinity of the energy pattern
			"cloud." I am personally
			convinced that something from this
			"cloud" now shares...
			... the captain's mind. But there
			seems to be nothing we can do...
			at least within regulations.
			There have been no actions
			warranting relieving Captain
			Picard. And our medical
			personnel, while dubious about
			his condition, are not prepared
			to certify the captain's
			incapacity.
			Approaching the "cloud," sir.
			Very well, Mister La Forge. Bring
			us to within ten thousand
			kilometers and hold us there.
			Aye, sir.
			Shall we begin the scientific
			tests that you wanted, sir?
			They are already underway.
			I have an announcement for the
			entire bridge.
			As many of you suspected...
			... when our ship passed through
			the edge of this, it accidentally
			carried off a sentient being... one
			much like these energy patterns
			we're seeing here.
			A frightening experience for any
			intelligent being. As if a great
			claw reached down and scooped up
			any of you from your home world.
			Drawn into the energy pathways
			of this vessel...
			... it found its way to you, Worf,
			frantic at being carried from its
			home. Recognizing you as
			sentient beings, it pleaded for
			help.
			... but in ways you could not
			understand... going desperately
			from one to another of you...
			then discovering the computer
			intelligence in the ship's memory
			circuits.
			Simplistic intelligence, but it
			furnished a way to slow this
			Enterprise thing that had captured
			it.
			And it very much regrets the
			accidental death of Engineer Singh
			during this...
			Captain, do you exist in
			combination with the entity?
			Is it in control of you, sir?
			By the time we combined...
			... We had learned much about each
			other... our passion for
			exploration... for the unknown.
			We found we had similar
			dreams... and it offered your
			captain a way to realize them
			beyond any human expectation.
			Captain, I must speak to you
			privately...now.
			I understand. As an energy
			pattern free of the limitations
			of matter... it might travel
			anywhere, at any velocity...
			Captain, did you hear me?
			Sir, I see no way for you to
			journey with an energy form.
			Isn't there?
			Maybe... just maybe...
			He's planning to beam both the
			entity and himself into that
			"cloud."
			The transporter need not pattern
			your captain back into matter...
			we'll beam energy only...
			... and we will become...
			... a combined energy pattern of
			that life form.
			A resignation from this command
			and from Starfleet has been
			appropriately recorded...
			I refuse to allow this, sir.
			Oh? Under what Fleet regulation?
			Does this resignation threaten
			the ship and its company in any
			way?
			Captain Picard, you are now
			relieved from duty. I judge you
			disabled...
			... mentally incapacitated...
			Security! Help me restrain the
			Captain... 
			This is blinding me...
			... Where is he? These light
			flashes...
			Captain! I'll help you if you'll
			let me... 
			Hang on to the captain, someone!
			The Transporter Chief has no idea
			of what the coordinates were, sir.
			He's just out there "somewhere?"
			How can we settle for that?
			Give me a choice, then.
			Still no readings, no sign of
			anything.
			Mister La Forge, it's time to
			set a course for Parliament. Warp
			eight.
			We're really leaving him... ?
			I've waited as long as possible,
			Lieutenant.
			Wait! I'm feeling... yes, it's
			the captain!
			The captain only. He's out there
			alone!
			The entity... has it abandoned him?
			Aban... ? No, the combination just
			wasn't possible out there.
			The Captain's in trouble, sir;
			we must beam him back!
			Beam him back as what? He's
			nothing but energy now.
			Sir, the entity was caught by
			the ship's circuitry -- the
			captain might try to get in the
			same way if he's in trouble!
			Move the ship in closer!
			Moving in, sir. But where?
			No way to know. Let's hope he
			can come part way himself.
			Troi, is there any way you can...
			"get" a message to him?
			I wish I could.
			Sensors are monitoring our
			perimeter, the ship's circuitry...
			Nothing, sir.
			Take us into the edge of it, La
			Forge.
			Mom, is he gone for good?
			The funny thing is, I... I sort
			of liked him...
			Sir! On my sensor controls...
			Something's here. I can feel it!
			Just as before! Going to you
			first, Worf...
			Something crazy on my viewer
			circuits...
			Commander Riker!
			"Static?"
			"P" for Picard!
			He's in the ship's circuitry!
			Come to the Transporter Room.
			Please!
			There might be a way, sir! Hurry!
			This is a wild theory Data!
			I knew we had to have the
			captain's physical pattern here,
			He was the last one beamed out.
			Is what you're thinking possible?
			Unknown at this time, sir. I
			hope the captain remembers his
			pattern is here.
			If he has, his energy has moved
			into the transporter relays by
			now...
			Wish we had some sign he's there.
			We've no choice but to risk it.
			Energizing, sir!
			What the devil am I doing here?!
			Sounds like our Captain...
			But confused. This Picard-pattern
			was formed before he went out
			there...
			What's happening to me, Number
			One? I was ready to beam away...
			somewhere... I remember talk of
			an... an entity? But all that
			seems so vague...
			I believe the Captain is now his
			separate self, sir. A lot of what
			happened is naturally missing...
			Data, what nonsense are you
			talking now? Is it still
			"Sherlock Holmes?"
			Ah, yes. Indubitably, sir,
			indubitably.
			Well, at least get rid of that
			damned pipe. It smells.
			Doctor Crusher asked me to steer
			you past Sickbay. She says you've
			looked very tired.
			Sorry Commander, but Security Team
			Two reports they've discovered
			a puddle of blood outside the
			Selay Quarters and they can't
			find one of the delegates and...
			Lieutenant, couldn't this have
			waited a moment? We've got the
			captain back.
			Good to see you, sir. The problem
			is that one of the cooks has just
			been asked to broil Reptile for
			the Anticans... and it looks like
			the Selay delegate...
			Riker, with these "peace"
			delegates and all, I do need some
			rest. Take charge, Number One.
