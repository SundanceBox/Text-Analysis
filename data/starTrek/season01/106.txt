			Captain's log, Stardate 41263.1.
			We have rendezvoused with the
			USS Fearless from which...
			... a Starfleet propulsion expert
			and his assistant are beaming over
			to conduct tests on the
			Enterprise's warp drive engines.
			I don't understand your
			concern, Number One. They're
			not authorized to make any
			alterations in our engines.
			According to Starfleet's message,
			they will simply test different
			ways of entering warp speed and
			different intermix formulas.
			What's the harm in that?
			It's the specs that Kosinski sent
			us. In my opinion, sir, they're
			gibberish.
			Gibberish?
			Mister Data, will you explain?
			Sir, we put Mister Kosinski's
			specs into the computer and ran
			a controlled test on them. There
			was no improvement in engine
			performance.
			Then explain Starfleet's report
			how the same tests on the USS
			Ajax...
			... and then on the Fearless over
			there, resulted in a measurable
			increase in propulsion.
			Our engines are new, sir, top
			condition. The tests on those
			older ships may have simply
			straightened out some engine
			inefficiency.
			Bridge from Transporter Chief.
			Two from USS Fearless are ready
			to beam over.
			Stand by for Commander Riker,
			Chief. He's on his way.
			Obviously, something does
			worry you about these tests.
			Yes, sir. And if you don't
			mind...
			... I'll ask Counselor Troi to
			look these visitors over.
			Welcome aboard, Mister Kosinski.
			I'm the first officer, Commander
			William Riker. This is...
			Where is the captain, please?
			He is engaged in other duties,
			sir...
			A ship's engines should be a
			concern of the ship's captain...
			They are, sir. Which is why they
			make their first officers directly
			responsible for engine condition
			and performance.
			Guided, of course, by one of our
			chief engineers, Lieutenant Commander
			Argyle in this case.
			A pleasure, sir. I appreciated
			receiving the advance specs...
			On which you have no end of
			questions?
			Aye, I have.
			And you, sir, are listed
			as...as...
			As Mister Kosinski's assistant.
			My actual name is unpronounceable
			by humans...
			From Tau Alpha C. That's very
			distant...
			... All approved and described in
			the Starfleet communications.
			Now...
			... I'd like to set up in the
			Engine Room immediately...
			Our chief engineer will show you
			to his Engine Room.
			No need -- I know my way around
			starships...
			One thing Kosinski isn't hiding.
			A bad disposition.
			Agreed... Also, he's arrogant,
			overbearing, self-important.
			And very sure of himself and
			his ability.
			And the other one -- his assistant?
			He's the puzzle.
			With most life forms I feel
			something. I may not be able to
			interpret or understand it, but
			I feel something, if only a
			presence. With him -- nothing.
			Empty space. It was as though
			he isn't even here.
			... Something about this concerns
			me. I don't know what, I can't
			point out a reason... yet.
			Stay concerned. Please! The
			safety of the Enterprise may be
			entrusted to those two!
			Inform the bridge I shall begin
			the first test in precisely fifty
			minutes. Why is that child here?
			He's working on a school project.
			Before you continue, there are
			some questions. First, tell us...
			... To save myself time, let me
			ask those questions for you.
			You received the information which
			Starfleet provided -- you fed it
			into your computer -- being as
			precise as humanly possible -- then
			you ran a controlled test. And,
			then, to your astonishment --
			nothing happened.
			So you said - "What's going on?
			This doesn't work. Kosinski's
			a fraud."
			You see, I have had this
			discussion on other Starfleet
			vessels. They didn't understand
			it; why should you?
			You are surely not saying it's
			unexplainable?
			I'm saying I'm not a teacher, and
			don't want to become one. I have
			neither the inclination nor time.
			You have all the time you need.
			I don't think you understand.
			This has already been approved
			by Starfleet Command.
			But it hasn't been approved by
			the chief engineer... or by me.
			I didn't know that was necessary.
			Now you do.
			Perhaps I should talk with Captain
			Picard.
			If you like, but it won't change
			anything.
			How basic shall I be?
			I leave that to you.
			We can save a little time this
			way. My assistant is laying in
			my base formulas a bit more
			rapidly than a human can do it...
			... even myself.
			Here is, in the simplest possible
			terms, what I do. This warp drive
			system was tuned only in the
			grossest sense, at least to my
			standard anyway. What I do is
			specific.
			How should I say this?
			Aah... sufficient to say for now,
			these symbols and their
			relationships have greater meaning
			to me than to you...
			... although you can in time learn
			them. Then, those of you
			sufficiently gifted, can duplicate
			my results.
			But the three percent efficiency
			increase of the other vessels
			could still have been caused by
			other things such as simply
			working more carefully, better
			station coordination...
			And you mention "gifted." In
			what way? Whatever any of us can
			learn to do on a computer, another
			computer can eventually perform
			faster, more precisely...
			Wrong! What the computer can't
			do is create. Only the mind...
			... is capable of true, original
			thought.
			But what we're dealing with is
			mechanics. However complex it
			may be, it has to do with an
			engine.
			And that is exactly where you go
			wrong. Warp drive has become so
			complex that it is...
			... as filled with mysteries as
			nature itself.
			If you'll view the screen with
			me and consider the following.
			Is this merely "mechanics" or is
			it nature that we deal with in
			this? What else than nature are
			elementals like space and time?
			Boy, don't play with that.
			Main Engineering is ready to
			proceed, Captain.
			Engineering, this is the bridge.
			It's your call.
			Do this one just like the others.
			Nothing changes.
			Commander -- I will make my
			preliminary adjustments at warp
			one-point-five, and complete them
			as we achieve warp six.
			Engineering to bridge, did you
			copy that?
			Affirmative, Number One. Are you
			ready?
			We are.
			La Forge, set in warp
			one-point-five.
			Warp one-point-five.
			Engage!
			All right, here we go.
			Passing warp five.
			What are you doing... ?
			What is our velocity?
			It is off the scale, sir...
			Reverse engines!
			Captain, no one has ever reversed
			engines at this velocity.
			That's because no one has ever
			gone this fast. REVERSE ENGINES!
			All stop!
			Position.
			Calculating it, sir.
			Data, what do you read there?
			A malfunction... I trust.
			Position please, Lieutenant La
			Forge.
			According to these readings, sir,
			we have not only left our own
			galaxy, but have passed through
			two others, stopping on the far
			side of Triangulum -- the Galaxy
			known as M-Thirty-Three.
			That's not possible. Data, what
			is our distance traveled?
			Two million -- seven hundred
			thousand light years.
			I can't accept that.
			You must, sir. Our comparisons
			show it to be completely
			accurate.
			And I calculate that at maximum
			warp, sir...
			... it would take over three
			hundred years to get home.
			Captain's log, stardate 41263.2.
			This will be a rather unusual log
			entry, assuming Starfleet ever
			receives it. As I have already
			informed my crew...
			... a phenomenal surge of power
			during a warp speed experiment
			has sent our starship hurtling
			out of our own galaxy, past
			another, taking us over two
			million, seven-hundred thousand
			light years in a few minutes.
			Message on this has been
			transmitted to Starfleet, sir.
			Which, traveling subspace, they
			should receive in fifty-one years,
			ten months...
			Mister Data... !
			Sir?
			Captain Picard, I presume?
			We're still trying to determine
			what happened, sir.
			The truth is, Captain, I made a
			mistake. A wonderful, incredible
			mistake.
			Just explain what brought us here!
			As the power built, I applied the
			energy asymtotically. I
			anticipated some tiling, but it
			didn't occur. That was my error
			-- using Bessel functions from
			the beginning.
			What is he saying, Number One?
			Well... if you want the truth,
			sir, it sounds to me like
			nonsense. But considering...
			But considering where we are, we
			must assume it isn't.
			I can call my mother. She's a
			doctor...
			No, there's nothing she can do.
			I need to rest. I've been away
			too long.
			Whatever happened to you... was
			it part of what happened to the
			ship?
			Please believe I mean no harm to
			this vessel... or those in it...
			Is Mister Kosinski like he sounds?
			A joke?
			No, that's too cruel. He has
			sensed some small part of this...
			... that space and time and thought
			aren't... well, aren't the
			separate things they seem to be?
			I... I just thought the formula
			you were using said something like
			that...
			Boy, don't you ever say that
			again. At least, not at your age
			in a world that's not ready for
			such...
			... such dangerous nonsense.
			I've always suspected this rate
			of speed was possible, of course,
			but, at this level -- never. We
			are going to need new definitions.
			New parameters.
			Perhaps you could call it the
			Kosinski scale.
			Why not? Since I'm the one who
			has made the so-called "warp
			barrier" meaningless.
			And, Captain, this must be a
			special thrill for you.
			"Thrill?"
			As an explorer. In three
			centuries of space flight, we have
			charted just eleven percent of
			our galaxy. Then...
			... voila, we accomplish this.
			Yes... but isn't the real point,
			can you do it again? Can you get
			us home?
			Of course I can. I'll just do what
			I did before.
			Coming, Riker?
			Commander Riker will join you in
			a moment.
			Comment is invited. Counselor?
			He's convinced he's right -- I
			have no doubt of that.
			Can you allow a man who has made
			one mistake back into a position
			where he may make another?
			What are the options? If he
			doesn't do it, who will?
			Captain, we are here. Why not
			avail ourselves of this
			opportunity for study? There
			is a giant protostar here in the
			process of forming. No vessel
			has been out this far.
			Spoken like a true Starfleet
			graduate.
			It is tempting, eh Number One?
			Aye, sir, it is.
			As they say, sir... you're the
			captain.
			Yes, that's the problem. I know
			that if Kosinski can get us home,
			Starfleet could use his technique
			to send back a pure science
			vessel to do even more.
			Number One -- have Mister Kosinski
			prepare to get us out of here.
			Aye, sir.
			Do you realize that many great
			advancements of mankind have been
			tied to speed? This is a moment
			in history -- right now. Right
			here. And your names will be
			linked forever with mine.
			Excuse me, Commander Riker. I
			don't think he did it... I think
			it was...
			Not now, Wes.
			But, when this all happened, I
			was watching his assistant and...
			I'm sure it was fascinating,
			Wesley, and I look forward to
			hearing about it. But not right
			now!
			Standing by, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			Come on.
			He's too tired.
			Why don't you do it by yourself?
			Yes, why not?
			No, I will help.
			As you wish.
			I've laid in a reciprocal course
			back, Captain.
			You may tell the captain I am
			ready, First Officer.
			Ready for you to engage, Captain.
			Warp one-point-five.
			Warp one-point-five.
			It's not working...
			ALL STOP!
			Answering all stop.
			Captain, according to the
			instruments, our speed never
			exceeded warp one-point-five.
			All stopped, Captain.
			Yes, but where is this place?
			Where none have gone before.
			Captain's log Stardate 41263.3.
			Instead of returning to our own
			galaxy...
			... the Enterprise has gone forward
			to a place in the universe which
			is uncharted and unknown. Our
			ship's instruments...
			... have continued to operate,
			our motion and course sensors
			reveal what would ordinarily be
			considered impossible...
			... but this is very real... our
			present position puts us at over
			a billion light years from our
			galaxy.
			Data, you have the helm. I'll
			be in Engineering.
			Main Engineering.
			What is it?
			A Klingon Targ!
			From home, my pet...
			... but when I was a child!
			You're telling us that's a
			kittycat?
			Yes, I suppose that's what you...
			You darling, what are you doing
			here?
			Now, run. This isn't a safe place
			at all.
			What's wrong, Tasha? You look
			frightened to death.
			I.. I was at...
			This is crazy! I was at the
			colony where I grew up ... being
			chased by a rape gang...
			Captain, we need help...
			How? What is troubling you?
			Don't you see what's following
			us?!
			You look tense, Jean-Luc. Sit
			and have a cup of tea.
			Maman.
			I'll make it good and strong, the
			way you like it.
			We will have a nice long talk.
			Maman... this can't be! You've
			been...
			Dead? But I'm always with you,
			you know that.
			Strange, but... yes, I've felt
			that. But why now...suddenly...
			Why out here, you mean? At what
			you see as the end of the
			universe? Or do you see this as
			the beginning of it?
			We... we believed it the outer rim.
			Tres Euclidian.
			Do you understand these things,
			Maman?
			Maman, can you tell me where my
			ship is? What is this place?
			Captain, you were reported headed
			for...
			Just a moment, Number One!
			Can I help you, sir?
			No... no, let's help all of us.
			General Quarters, Red Alert!
			What is it Captain? Why are we
			at General Quarters?
			I had to get everyone's attention.
			This was the quickest way.
			This is the captain. This is not
			a drill. It seems that in this
			place, the physical universe and
			... and the world of ideas are
			intermixed. What we think also
			becomes real. Therefore, we must,
			repeat MUST begin controlling our
			thoughts.
			We will report all this to you
			more fully as our understanding
			increases. The Enterprise will
			stay at full alert until this
			crisis is solved.
			What did you do?
			It wasn't him. It never was.
			It was his assistant.
			What are you talking about?
			Kosinski wasn't the one
			controlling the warp experiment.
			It was me!
			The equations he punched in were
			nonsense, just as we thought.
			I honestly thought it was me.
			I thought somehow... somehow that
			I was operating on his level.
			It's also my fault, Captain. I
			should have realized it wasn't
			Kosinski.
			How could you? How could
			anyone... ?
			Wesley did.
			If you knew something, why didn't
			you say so?!
			He tried -- twice. But I didn't
			listen.
			He's unconscious. Why?
			I'm not certain yet...
			He phased.
			What does that mean?
			Parts of him just disappeared,
			then came back. No one else was
			paying attention to him the first
			time.
			When we saw it this time, he
			seemed to be struggling...
			fighting it...
			He's dying.
			Save him! He's the only one
			who can get us back!
			Realistically, it does not seem
			possible.
			Captain's log, supplemental. Our
			position is unknown and our only
			chance of returning to the known
			universe is a dying alien...
			... who is generally humanoid but
			with a physiology sufficiently
			different from our own to create
			medical problems in caring for
			him.
			Cause?
			I don't know. My equipment
			here does not register his kind
			of life signs. I would have to
			guess exhaustion, fatigue.
			Is he going to be all right?
			What's the boy doing here?
			Mom... he's my friend.
			You may want him here before we're
			done sir.
			He seemed to feel some kind of
			relationship with the boy.
			My name is Wesley, Mister Riker.
			He knows...
			... We all know.
			Will he live?
			I'm not sure.
			Wake him.
			I recommend we let him come around
			in his own time.
			We don't have that luxury. Wake him.
			He could die and with him any
			chance we have.
			Doctor...
			Wes... You and I have other
			friends aboard this ship, too.
			If we remain in this place any
			longer we may lose the ability
			to tell the difference between
			thought and reality. Regardless
			of the risk, we must wake him...
			now.
			Do you recognize me? I'm the
			captain... I need answers.
			Do my best... to provide...
			Who are you? Or what?
			I am -- a Traveler.
			A traveler? What is your
			destination?
			Destination?
			Yes, what place are you trying
			to reach?
			Place? No, there is no
			specific place I wish to go.
			Then what is the purpose of this
			journey?
			Curiosity.
			That's not an answer. What is
			it that you want?
			I have certain... "abilities."
			They give me an understanding of
			-- propulsion. I have been trading
			this for passage on Starfleet
			vessels.
			Allowing Kosinski to take the
			credit for what you did.
			It seemed the sensible way.
			Until now.
			Captain, I seek only
			transportation in order to see
			and experience your... your
			reality. I am not a threat to
			you, your ship or your crew.
			He isn't, Captain. I know he
			isn't.
			Our "reality?" And in satisfying
			yourself, you have put my ship and
			my crew at great risk.
			I have made some mistakes.
			Some mistakes? What kind of
			"mistake" can cause these
			incredible explosions of velocity?
			... I don't know if I can put it
			in terms you'll understand.
			I believe that there may be a warp
			speed that could have gotten us
			to Galaxy M-Thirty-Three... but
			there is no "velocity" of any
			magnitude which could bring us
			to wherever this is. Can you
			tell us if our navigation sensors
			are right? Is this millions of
			light years from where we were?
			Yes.
			What got us here?
			Thought.
			Thought?!
			You do understand don't you that
			thought is the basis of all
			reality? The... "energy" of
			thought, to put it in your terms,
			is very powerful.
			That's not an explanation.
			I have the ability to act like
			a lens which focuses thought.
			That's just so much nonsense.
			You're asking us to believe in
			magic.
			Yes -- this could seem like magic
			to you.
			No, it actually makes some sense
			to me. Only the power of thought
			could explain what's been
			happening. Especially out here.
			Thought is the essence of where
			you are now. You do understand
			the danger?
			Chaos. What we think is what
			happens.
			It pains me I was so careless,
			Captain.
			My intent was only to observe,
			not to cause this. You should
			not be here until your far, far
			distant future. Certainly not
			until you have learned control.
			You are from a different time,
			aren't you?
			Well -- no -- not exactly from
			another "time." Although as you
			understand the concept... yes,
			perhaps that term fits as well
			as any.
			And you have this ability to...
			ah... "travel."
			Yes...
			And others of your kind can also
			"travel?"
			Yes.
			Then, why -- in all of our history
			-- has there never been a record
			of you or someone like you having
			visited us?
			What wonderful arrogance. There
			is no record because we have not
			visited you before.
			Why not?
			Ah. Well, up until now ... if
			you'll forgive this... when
			compared to many others in the
			universe, you have been...
			uninteresting. It's only now that
			your life form begins to merit
			serious attention. I'm...
			sorry...
			No, no -- none of that.
			He's unconscious again.
			Revive him.
			Whatever you need from him, you
			better get it soon.
			I suggest, sir, that the first
			jump out of our galaxy was as he
			said, a "mistake"...
			Or he was distracted by something.
			But it weakened him in some way,
			leading to the incredible jump
			out here.
			Theory!
			Can you propose some facts that
			fit this?
			Can you get us back?
			Wait, Captain. Not so fast. We
			have an opportunity for scientific
			discovery here...
			And report our observations how?
			To whom?
			Can you get us back?!
			I will try.
			Number One, you'll take the
			Traveler to Main Engineering;
			I'll be on the bridge...
			He is very weak.
			I know.
			The Captain is right. We don't
			have much time.
			But first, I request a moment with
			the captain. Alone!
			Strange how he seems to care for
			you.
			He will forget me in time. Which
			is as it should be.
			It is Wesley I wanted to speak to
			you about.
			The boy?
			It's best you do not repeat this
			to the others... especially not
			to the mother. Whatever may
			happen, it is best it proceeds
			naturally.
			I must get my ship back; do we
			have time for this?
			Yes. He and a few like him are
			why I travel.
			You have it in your power to
			encourage him without
			interfering...
			Encourage him in what?
			How shall I explain? Are you
			acquainted with the intricacies
			of what is called here... music?
			Somewhat.
			And musical genius such as I saw
			in one of your ship's libraries.
			One called Mozart, for example?
			Who as a small child wrote
			astonishing symphonies as you call
			them... whose genius made music
			a tangible reality to be not only
			heard, but also seen and felt
			beyond the ability, the
			understanding, of others?
			Your Wesley is such a person.
			Not with music but with the
			equally lovely intricacies of
			time, energy, propulsion...
			... and the instruments of this
			vessel which allow all that to
			be played.
			You are right, I must hurry now...
			You are right in something else.
			He is also just a boy for now.
			He should be encouraged... but
			told none of this.
			Help him to Engineering. I'll
			be on the bridge. We must try
			to get back home.
			Yes, sir.
			Put it out.
			How?
			Think! Put the flame out in your
			thoughts.
			Now. Get to your station and
			concentrate on your assignment.
			Captain's log, any time entry is
			meaningless. We have no choice
			but to repeat the same warp
			experiment...
			... but wish one variation. A
			principal part of this warp
			formula will be the thoughts of
			everyone aboard the Enterprise.
			We have no idea exactly how this
			works...
			... we understand only that the
			Traveler makes use of this
			somehow. It will be most
			important that those aboard avoid
			random thoughts that might change
			the reality of what we're
			attempting to do.
			Any further advice, Counselor?
			When you begin the attempt, there
			will be stress... And it's only
			natural that the crew's
			concentration will shift.
			Plus some genuine fear, Captain.
			You can't notice what's outside
			without feeling some of that.
			ALL DECKS, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN
			SPEAKING. ALL DECKS...
			... I MUST HAVE YOUR FULL
			ATTENTION. IN A FEW MOMENTS AS
			WE ATTEMPT TO WARP BACK HOME, IT
			IS VITAL... ABSOLUTELY VITAL, THAT
			YOU CENTER YOUR THOUGHTS ON YOUR
			DUTY... OR UPON THE WELFARE OF
			THE ONE CALLED 'THE TRAVELER.'
			THINK OF GIVING HIM SOME...
			... OF YOUR STRENGTH. URGENT.
			THIS IS AN ORDER. YOU MUST
			TRY TO DO THIS.
			YOU WILL ATTEMPT NOW TO CONCENTRATE
			COMPLETELY ON EITHER YOUR DUTY OF
			THE MOMENT... OR UPON THE
			TRAVELER... ON HIS WELL BEING.
			THINK OF HIM AS SOMEONE YOU CARE
			DEEPLY ABOUT.
			And now to focus their thoughts
			on that...
			... ALL DECKS, ALL STATIONS, GO
			TO BATTLE STATIONS.
			I will need Kosinski back on the
			main computer.
			You need me?
			Yes --
			You're looking better.
			I'm feeling better.
			Helm, set in warp one point five,
			retroactive course.
			Warp one point five, sir.
			Retroactive two-six-one mark
			three-one.
			Bridge to Engineering...Standby.
			There is such an abundance of
			well-being on this ship. It feels
			like...
			... quite wonderful.
			Engineering to bridge, we're
			ready.
			On my order, Mister Data... Mister
			La Forge...
			Engage!
			It's not happening... not
			enough...
			Warp one-point-five, sir...
			... which is what my instruments
			have read all along.
			Our position reads exactly what
			it was before this sleigh-ride
			began, sir.
			Sleigh-ride?
			Or whatever you want to call it,
			Data. I don't have a name for
			it.
			The Traveler's gone, sir.
			Gone?
			He phased completely out of
			existence... at least out of our
			existence.
			Attention all decks. This is to
			inform you that the Traveler has
			left us. With your support, he
			has returned us to our galaxy.
			Wherever he has gone, we wish him
			well.
			Have the boy come up on the
			bridge, Number One.
			Wesley Crusher, report to the
			Bridge.
			On the double.
			Our next assignment is on this
			heading?
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Data, Mister La Forge...
			Increase to warp five. Same
			heading.
			Warp five, sir.
			Same heading, sir.
			Come onto the bridge, Wesley.
			Move!
			Commander Riker told me how
			supportive you were in
			Engineering. Well done.
			At ease -- sit here in Command.
			Captain -- that's not allowed.
			Your orders.
			Oh, that's true. I can't waive
			them again.
			Only commissioned officers.
			It's quite all right, sir, I
			understand.
			Please don't interrupt me, Wesley.
			Sorry, sir...
			Any commission rank?
			Even an ensign?
			Then he would have authorized
			access to the bridge.
			Well, then, I'll have to make him
			an Acting Ensign.

			-- Wesley Crusher is made acting
			ensign. With all the duties and
			privileges of that rank.
			And Mister Crusher, whether the
			rank becomes permanent is up to
			you.
			At the first opportunity your
			entrance application will be
			tendered to Starfleet Academy.
			Until then you will learn this
			ship. Every operation -- every
			function. Commander Riker -- a
			duty schedule for Mister Crusher.
			Heavy on study.
			Aye, sir.
			Meanwhile, you can sit and learn
			something here.
			Sir, shall I send for Doctor
			Crusher?
			Why? Is someone ill?
			Or do you want to go tell her
			about this?
			If you don't mind, sir, I'd like
			to sit here awhile. I'll tell
			her later.
