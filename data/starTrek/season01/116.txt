			Captain's log, stardate 41365.9.
			The Enterprise has been ordered
			to Starbase 74, in orbit around
			Tarsas III.
			... where a routine maintenance
			check of all systems will be made,
			and certain upgrades completed,
			including the Holodeck, with which
			we have had problems. I anticipate
			a glowing report. This ship has
			performed magnificently -- beyond
			anyone's expectations.
			Coming into position.
			Stand by to dock.
			Ready to dock.
			Engage mooring beams and lock
			off.
			Aye sir.
			Docking complete.
			Thank you, Number One. Well
			done, and well done all.
			Commander Quinteros; request
			permission to come aboard.
			Granted -- and welcome.
			This is Commander Riker.
			You're late. We expected you a
			week ago.
			We were unexpectedly delayed at
			Omicron Pascal.
			Is there anything specific you
			wish to report, or that we should
			be aware of?
			No. We are very pleased with the
			operation of the Enterprise.
			I knew you would be - I was in
			charge of the team which put her
			together.
			And are these gentlemen the
			Bynars?
			They're not gentlemen or ladies,
			Commander.
			They are a unified pair. Always
			together. This is One Zero.
			And this is Zero One.
			They just finished upgrading the
			computers on the Wellington -- did
			a great job.
			Your reputation precedes you.
			I am pleased you will be improving
			our system.
			It is a great pleasure...
			... to work on such a large mobile
			computer.
			You have forty-eight hours,
			because at forty-eight plus six
			we have an appointment at Pelleus
			Five which we must keep.
			I thought we'd...
			... have more time.
			I'm sorry. Our mission can't be
			delayed. Can we postpone this
			work?
			Oh, no. This is...
			... the best time...
			... to do it.
			We can complete...
			... our work within the...
			... time allotted.
			They work very quickly, but it'll
			be tight.
			Commander Riker and I will stay
			aboard, and be available should
			you need us.
			Thank you, Captain. I don't think
			we'll need you until we're ready
			for inspection.
			The Bynars are perfect for this.
			This is the first time I've come
			in contact with them.
			As I understand it, over time
			they've become so interconnected
			with the master computer on their
			planet that their language and
			thought patterns have become as
			near to binary as possible for
			organic beings.
			It will be interesting to see how
			they improve a computer as
			advanced as ours.
			Well, I'm going to put my feet
			up, turn on my personal relaxation
			light and lose myself in the pages
			of some old novels.
			Bridge.
			And you, Number One? You've
			earned a good rest. What are you
			going to do with it?
			I've never been good at organizing
			my time off, but something will
			come up -- it always does.
			I'll be in my Ready Room.
			I thought there were only going
			to be two of you.
			Because of the limited time
			allotted...
			... us, we need others...
			Is there a problem?
			Ah... No...
			...no. No problem.
			Then why are you all so excited?
			Because we... ah... have to...
			... the ah, stacking...
			... to reconfigure the computer...
			... to communicate with itself...
			... more efficiently...
			... and at higher speeds.
			You act like you don't believe
			them.
			I'm not sure. It's probably
			nothing.
			Maybe it's just how a different
			species behaves.
			Maybe. I'm going to stroll the
			ship. You have the bridge. Keep
			an eye on them.
			Aye sir.
			We've been challenged to a
			friendly game of Parrises Squares
			by some of the maintenance
			personnel -- want to join us on
			the starbase?
			You've already got all the players
			you need.
			We can switch off.
			No... if you do that in Parrises
			Squares you lose the rhythm of
			the game.
			I can't talk you into coming with
			us?
			No. But win, all right? The
			pride of the Enterprise goes with
			you.
			Rest assured, Commander, we will
			be victorious, at whatever the
			cost.
			Worf -- it's just a game. You
			know, a little friendly
			competition -- work up a sweat,
			have some laughs, make new
			friends.
			If winning is not important...
			then, Commander, why keep score?
			I think he's pulling your leg.
			Believe it or not, Worf's
			developing a sense of humor.
			Let's hope so for their sake.
			Computer -- There's a power
			reduction in section L-Ninety
			Four. Explain.
			Unoccupied sections are being
			closed down in order to clear
			space in the main computer banks.
			It's necessary to facilitate the
			system upgrade. Full power can
			be restored if needed.
			What do you think?
			First tell me what it's supposed
			to be, then I'll give you an
			opinion.
			It is an attempt at pure
			creativity.
			What we're investigating is, "Can
			Data be creative?"
			This is my attempt... with
			guidance from Geordi.
			I suggested the Zylo eggs.
			Is that what those are?
			Keep notes. This project might
			turn out to be of interest to
			future scholars.
			Really?
			Think about it. A blind man
			teaching an android to paint?
			That's got to be worth a couple
			of pages in someone's book.
			You look like you're packing up
			and leaving forever.
			Oh -- Commander Riker. No -- I'm
			just getting my notes together.
			It's so exciting. Doctor Terence
			Epstein is at this Starbase.
			Is he someone I should know about?
			He's the leading mind in
			cybernetics. He lectured at
			my medical school. Since the
			disaster at Micromius I've been
			working on a theory combining
			cybernetics and regeneration. It
			sounds impossible I know -- but I
			think I have an approach which
			could work. What an opportunity!
			To have a chance to discuss this
			with Doctor Esptein. Sorry, Will,
			I'd like to stay here and chat --
			but I have to be going.
			How's it going?
			We are almost done...
			... the deviation...
			... caused by a previous...
			... probe has been corrected...
			... You may use the equipment...
			... anytime you wish.
			How much has it been changed?
			What exactly did you do?
			Enhancement...
			... nothing more.
			This could be perfect!
			Let's use him!
			Would you like to try...
			... the enhancement?
			All right. What should I do?
			Computer - I need a place to play
			some music - a little atmosphere.
			Specify.
			Jazz.
			Era?
			Circa 1958.
			Location.
			Kansas City. No, wait. New
			Orleans. Yeah. New Orleans -- the
			Low Note. 'Round midnight.
			Program complete. Enter when
			ready.
			Very good.
			Very good indeed.
			Now, computer -- someone to play
			with. A combo. Say, drums
			upright bass...piano. And a 'bone
			for me.
			Now -- an audience...
			Whoa... too many. I was thinking
			of something a little more
			personal...intimate.
			Great job, boys.
			But, computer... blondes and jazz
			seldom go together.
			Now that is truly exceptional...
			...but... more sultry.
			Gentlemen, if this is what you
			call "enhancement" you have a gift
			for understatement.
			What's your name, and tell me you
			love jazz.
			My name is Minuet. I love all
			jazz except Dixieland.
			Why not Dixieland?
			Because you can't dance to it.
			My girl.
			What's a knockout like you doing
			in a computer-generated joint like
			this?
			Waiting for you.
			Waiting for me?!! You can't be
			serious?
			Oh yes, Will -- I've never been
			more serious in my life.
			It's working. All we need...
			... is to hold him here for twenty
			minutes.
			Do you mind if I ask you a
			question about the Bynars?
			Why not just ask them?
			What is that high-speed sound you
			make?
			That is our...
			... primary language.
			How can humanoids process
			information at that speed?
			We store the information...
			... with these buffers.
			We receive information...
			... all the time...
			... and save it...
			... until we need it.
			How did you happen to develop this
			ability?
			It happened over...
			... a long period of time.
			To have a society so interdependent
			on computers has
			tremendous advantages.
			And a few...
			...disadvantages.
			Everything under control, Ensign
			Crusher?
			Fine, Captain. I am just trying
			to learn something about the
			Bynars.
			Where's Commander Riker?
			Holodeck Four. Shall I call him
			for you, sir?
			No, I'll wander down and see
			what's he doing to occupy himself.
			Keep me apprised.
			Yes, sir.
			The chick digs you, man.
			What makes you say that?
			Hey -- look at her.
			Maybe it's my music.
			Yeah, well - about that... Don't
			give up your day job.
			It's all too real.
			Yeah, Slim you got that
			straight... too real is too
			right.
			Thanks for letting me sit in.
			Ain't nothin' to it.
			Strange cat...
			I know this. If they're in town
			-- we get 'em.
			I am going to have to leave you
			for a while and see to my duties.
			Your work is very important to
			you.
			It is me -- it's what I am.
			Can we dance once before you
			leave?
			Sure, why not.
			How did you learn to dance so
			well?
			From following you.
			I can anticipate your lead. Tell
			me more about your work -- what
			is it about it that consumes and
			enthralls you?
			What an interesting choice of
			words. That's exactly what it
			does.
			You are very fortunate.
			I know that.
			At this point in your life to be
			exactly where you want to be...
			And it's wonderful that you
			realize it.
			I'd be a fool not to know how
			lucky I am to be on this ship
			serving with this group of people.
			It's a dream come true.
			Just like this.
			A dream? Is that what this is?
			Is that what I am?
			I know you are a computer-generated
			image... but your smell,
			the way you feel, your touch, even
			the way you talk and think is so
			real.
			Thank you.
			How far can this relationship go?
			I mean, how real are you?
			As real as you need me to be.
			Astounding.
			Captain!
			Sorry, Number One -- I didn't mean
			to interrupt.
			It's all right, come in.
			You picked a wonderful locale.
			Something I might have chosen
			myself.
			Aren't you going to introduce me?
			Excuse me. Yes, yes, of course
			I am. Captain Picard, this is
			Minuet... Minuet, this is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard.
			Enchante. Comme c'est merveilleux
			de vous voir ici.
			Incroyable! Vous etes Parisienne?
			Au fonde c'est vrai, nous sommes
			tous Parisienne.
			Oui, au fonde nous sommes tous
			Parisienne. The spirit of that
			city can always restore my soul.
			I have been hoping to meet you.
			Oh.
			Have I been a topic of
			conversation?
			Indirectly.
			Join us, Jean-Luc.
			A glass of wine?
			Thank you.
			Will was saying how much he enjoys
			this assignment. It's a credit
			to you. For a ship and crew to
			function well it always starts
			with the captain. You set the
			tone.
			At the moment, it's you who are
			setting the tone.
			The sophistication of this
			programming is remarkable.
			In what way?
			The Holodeck has been able to give
			us woodlands and ski slopes and
			figures that fight and fictional
			characters with which we can
			interact -- but you are quite
			different. You adapt. You spoke
			French to me.
			It's very simple. When I heard
			your name, I merely accessed the
			foreign language bank.
			Impressive.
			Oui, mon choux.
			Now what are you doing?
			I am awaiting inspiration.
			Commander Data.
			This is Commander Data, go ahead.
			I'm getting an indication of
			possible trouble in Main
			Engineering.
			Can you be more specific?
			Not very much. I'm reading a
			problem with the magnetic field
			which contains the antimatter.
			Could you come up here?
			We'll go to Engineering since
			that's where the trouble is. Wes,
			don't disturb the captain or
			Commander Riker until we check
			this out.
			Aye, sir.
			bridge, this is Main Engineering.
			This is the bridge.
			Are you running any test programs?
			No.
			Are the Bynars?
			Not to my knowledge. Is something
			wrong?
			I don't know. There's nobody on
			duty here, and we're getting a
			strange reading from the magnetic
			containment field.
			The field is deteriorating.
			Contact the captain immediately.
			I am initiating Red Alert.
			I can't maintain the integrity
			of the containment field.
			If the antimatter is released the
			ship will be destroyed.
			Nothing I do has any effect. I'm
			losing it. I have rechecked every
			circuit. This is not a misread
			by the computer.
			Computer -- situation analysis.
			Estimate release of antimatter
			in four minutes eighteen seconds -- seventeen
			seconds -- sixteen
			seconds...
			Bridge -- Engineering.
			Yes. This is the bridge.
			Alert starbase. Inform them we
			are abandoning the ship. Tell
			them why. Initiate the automated
			sequence for departure, lay in
			a course and speed to put maximum
			distance between the Enterprise
			and any inhabited planet.
			Shouldn't we wait for the
			captain's approval?
			There is no time. Based on all
			the information presently
			available the decision is correct.
			This is Lieutenant Commander Data
			speaking for the captain -- abandon
			ship -- this is not a drill.
			I say again. All personnel
			abandon ship. Abandon ship -- this
			is not a drill -- this is not a
			drill.
			Decks One through Four to Cargo
			Transporters. Decks Five through
			Ten: Transporters: One-Two,
			Three-Four. Decks Six through
			Sixteen: Transporters: Five-Six,
			Seven-Eight, Nine-Ten. Decks
			Seventeen through Twenty-eight to
			Transporters: Eleven-Twelve,
			Thirteen-Fourteen. Decks Twenty-nine
			through Forty-two:
			Transporters: Fifteen-Sixteen,
			Seventeen-Eighteen, Nineteen-Twenty.
			This is not a drill.
			When I reviewed your fifth paper
			on molecular biology, I knew I
			was on the right track. You
			defined the problem as
			conductivity -- and that's exactly
			what...
			Attention all personnel.
			Emergency evacuation of USS
			Enterprise in progress. Report
			to your stations.
			Oh, no! Something's happened
			to the Enterprise. That's my
			ship!
			Hurry up! We don't have much
			time! The ship'll be leaving in
			a minute!
			What's going on?
			Please stand out of the way.
			The Enterprise is being evacuated.
			Why?
			Some problem in Engineering.
			Get the security team together.
			Aye, Lieutenant.
			Ship's log. Supplemental. This
			is Lieutenant Commander Data.
			I have put the ship on automated
			departure and ordered the complete
			evacuation of the Enterprise.
			Everyone remaining is leaving on
			foot or beaming off.
			Computer, where are the captain
			and Commander Riker?
			All decks empty.
			Curious. The captain is
			usually the last to leave.
			Let's go! We only have forty-one
			seconds.
			I think we're the last.
			I hope we are the last.
			Did you see the captain and
			Commander Riker?
			No. Are they not here on the
			Starbase?
			No.
			Are you saying they are still on
			the Enterprise?
			Yes. Sir, where's your
			Transporter Room?
			We have to beam back and get them.
			You haven't time!
			This is Starbase 74. The
			Enterprise magnetic field is
			regenerating.
			How is that possible?
			Unknown.
			That changes nothing. The captain
			and Commander Riker must be in
			trouble, or they'd be here.
			Look!
			Your ship's almost clear.
			The USS Enterprise has departed
			in excess of warp one.
			... and the boy never found out?
			Oh, yes, but not until later.
			When he finally walked in with
			his younger sister.
			And I'll bet both of them were
			all smiles.
			Yes. And we knew right then both
			of them had found out.
			You handled it in a very
			thoughtful way. You are very good
			with people.
			Don't you agree, Jean-Luc?
			She's very different from any
			images we've experienced on the
			Holodeck, isn't she? More -- you
			might say -- intuitive.
			It's as though she was plugged
			into my subconscious and can
			anticipate what I want her to say
			even before I'm aware of it
			myself.
			I suppose it's an understandable
			progression. Computers make
			decisions based on inputs and we
			humans give off many subtle signs
			which communicate our emotions.
			It's uncanny. I could develop
			feelings for Minuet. A desire
			exactly as I would for any woman.
			Doesn't love always begin that
			way? With the illusion being more
			real than the woman?
			Oh, Jean-Luc, spoken like a true
			Frenchman.
			I think I'll be leaving.
			Oh, don't go.
			Two's company.
			We have time -- there's no rush.
			I'd like it very much if you
			would stay.
			Yes, stay, Captain.
			This is your diversion, Number
			One. Not mine.
			Wait -- we haven't danced.
			I don't dance.
			Then some more wine.
			Thank you, no.
			Wait -- please. Please don't go -- you
			can't. Not yet.
			What?
			Why -- Minuet -- what's the matter?
			Why can't he leave?
			Exit.
			bridge, this is the captain.
			Situation report.
			Riker to bridge.
			Computer! Explain Red Alert.
			Initiated as a programmed
			response. The magnetic field
			containing the antimatter had
			weakened. There was no fail-safe
			available.
			Why wasn't I notified?
			Unknown.
			Present condition.
			The magnetic field is now
			restored. Containment is
			restored. Propulsion is at
			maximum efficiency.
			Locate Lieutenant Commander Data.
			Not on board the Enterprise.
			Explain.
			All Enterprise personnel except
			the captain and first officer have
			been evacuated.
			Evacuated!? Was the condition
			that critical?
			Yes.
			Are we still docked on the
			starbase?
			No.
			Position report.
			Coordinates four-one-five-nine
			point two-six by eight-one-nine-two-one
			by three-one-two. Heading
			Two-three-three mark four-five.
			Destination?
			Planet Bynaus in the Beta Magellan
			system.
			The Bynars!
			Am I to understand that the Bynars
			have stolen the Enterprise?
			That information is not available.
			It's the Bynars -- and you're part
			of this.
			Yes.
			They made you the lure to keep
			me here! They programmed you
			while I was relaxing.
			Yes. When they saw your interest
			in me, they thought I could
			distract you and keep you here.
			That explains, Riker... What about
			me?
			Your being here was just a
			fortunate happenstance.
			Why do they want me?
			What do they want with the
			Enterprise? What's their purpose?
			I am not programmed to give you
			that information.
			Come on, Number One. We've got
			to regain control of our ship!
			What do we do?
			Which is the nearest Starfleet
			vessel?
			The Trieste.
			I know the Trieste. Too small,
			too slow.
			Plus it's sixty-six hours away.
			Where are the Bynars?
			... I haven't seen them.
			Then they are obviously still
			aboard. Another Starfleet vessel
			must be sent to intercept the
			Enterprise at Bynaus. They might
			be taking the ship to their home
			planet.
			What makes you think so?
			It is the best place for us
			to start.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			now know "who" has commandeered
			the Enterprise... the Bynars.
			We can't communicate with the
			bridge. Commander Riker and I will
			now try to regain control of our
			ship.
			This way.
			But that's toward Engineering.
			That's our first stop, to verify
			the containment, and initiate
			auto-destruct.
			Initiate auto-destruct?
			The ship has been commandeered
			by a force of unknown size and
			intent. We're here alone. We
			must assume the worst.
			If we don't regain control, no
			one else will have it either.
			This is the only decision
			involving the operation of this
			ship which requires you and I to
			agree totally.
			It's the allotted time that
			concerns me.
			About that, there is no option.
			I know. It's a five minute
			countdown.
			It's sufficient to get to the
			bridge... once there, either
			we'll get control of the ship
			and shut off the auto-destruct,
			or we won't. The important thing
			is that this ship does not fall
			into hostile hands.
			Then let's set it and get going.
			Recognize Picard, Jean-Luc,
			Captain...
			Recognize Riker, William T,
			Commander.
			Set auto-destruct sequence.
			Does the first officer concur?
			... Yes. Set auto-destruct
			sequence -- now!
			Auto-destruct will detonate in
			four minutes and fifty-nine
			seconds... four minutes and
			fifty-eight seconds... four
			minutes and fifty-seven
			seconds...
			Let's go. The only place we can
			stop the count is from the bridge.
			What do you make of this?
			An enormous amount of data is
			being received and stored in the
			main computer.
			Just stored. Why?
			It's another piece to this puzzle.
			Access denied.
			They've locked it off.
			We've got to find another way to
			get in.
			One of us could beam onto the
			bridge.
			It takes several seconds to
			materialize. You wouldn't
			stand a chance.
			I could beam into the turbolift,
			force the doors, and take them
			by surprise.
			No. We'll beam in simultaneously
			in two different areas of the
			bridge.
			Only four minutes left.
			Still no response from the
			Enterprise.
			They would answer if they could.
			Someone else has control of the
			ship.
			Do you think I am responsible?
			Why? How could you have known?
			My station is on the bridge.
			You can't be on the bridge every
			minute.
			You are wrong, Geordi, I can.
			I do not need rest or diversion
			-- I should not have been painting.
			I was negligent.
			That's a pointless discussion.
			You could have been on the bridge
			and it still might have happened.
			You have three ships in here.
			We need one of them now.
			We're rushing repairs on the USS
			Melbourne -- but it's still
			eighteen hours until she'll be
			ready... There is nothing else
			you can do.
			I'll set a ten-second delay.
			Right. Coordinates for Main
			Bridge -- port forward for me and
			aft for you.
			You're on Pad Two.
			Done.
			Ten second delay... NOW.
			Why did you steal my ship?
			Please try...
			... to help us.
			Cancel auto-destruct.
			Does the first officer agree?
			Affirmative.
			Auto-destruct cancelled.
			We're in orbit around Bynaus.
			How are they?
			They appear dead.
			Let's see if we can get some
			answers from Bynaus.
			Their main computer is off.
			Sensors reveal all of the
			equipment on the planet is inert.
			They can neither receive nor send
			any messages.
			What about all the people in that
			world who are totally dependant
			on their computer? Are they still
			functioning?
			No. They are probably just like
			these Bynars here. Dying.
			So, what's this all about? Why
			did they steal the ship and bring
			it here? What was their purpose?
			They went to a lot of trouble to
			clear computer space. See what
			they've stored.
			Captain, it's enormous. Every
			byte of free space in the computer
			has been filled. They must have
			made a core-dump from their world
			to our computer.
			I can't get in.
			I need a code -- a password -- to
			access the file.
			They were desperate to steal this
			ship, bring it here to store all
			this information. Why?
			I don't know. I wish they had
			left a note.
			Perhaps they did.
			Minuet.
			Maybe.
			Tell me what this is all about.
			A star in the Bynar system went
			super nova and they miscalculated.
			The electromagnetic pulse from
			the explosion was going to knock
			out their main computer.
			Their only chance was to transfer
			all the stored information and
			shut down until after it passed.
			Then, reactivate their system and
			transfer the information back to
			this main computer.
			And the Enterprise has the only
			mobile computer large enough to
			handle all that information.
			So what went wrong?
			The star went super nova before
			it was expected and you were late
			arriving at Starbase 74.
			But why steal the ship? Why
			didn't they say something? Why
			didn't they just ask for help?
			I don't know. I don't have those
			answers.
			Is there anything we can do?
			Yes. Return the data stored in the
			Enterprise's computer back to the
			one on Bynaus.
			How do we do that?
			Don't you know?
			Yes. If we had the file name.
			But we don't. Do you?
			I don't know what you're talking
			about. No.
			They wouldn't intentionally hide
			it or make it difficult for us
			to find. It's got to be right
			in front of us.
			We should call Starbase 74, and
			see if anyone can decipher this.
			Hurry. They're dying.
			They meant you no harm. It was
			their world they were trying to
			save.
			Help them, Will -- please help
			them.
			Starbase 74 -- this is the
			Enterprise.
			This is Starbase 74. Captain
			Picard, what's your situation?
			We'll get into that later. Right
			now I must speak with Lieutenant
			Commander Data.
			I am here, sir.
			Data, the Bynars have stored an
			enormous amount of information
			in the computer. We can't access
			it, and we must.
			The access would be available by
			code or password.
			I know, but what could it be?
			File names can be anything.
			They want us to find it. They
			would have kept it simple.
			Then a name -- or a place. It
			could be personal. In this case
			in binary language which is ones
			and zeros in groups of eight or
			sixteen characters.
			Could it be that simple?
			Try it.
			That's the file. It'll work now.
			Well done, Will. Now access the
			file and start the transfer.
			So much for that idea.
			Let me get on the other position.
			The Bynars always work in pairs,
			perhaps that is also required.
			It appears to be successful. The
			system has started up -- a resident
			diagnostic program is running.
			Their system is incredible.
			You...
			... did it.
			... our world is...
			... reactivating.
			Our people...
			... express their gratitude.
			... We will return to...
			... your Starbase for whatever...
			... punishment your system...
			... requires of us.
			Why didn't you just ask for our
			help?
			You might have...
			... said no.
			But there was a very good chance
			we would have said "yes."
			Our need was too great...
			... to risk rejection.
			So you stole it.
			Their reason is part of their
			binary thinking -- for them there
			are only two choices -- one or zero
			-- yes or no.
			No one's been hurt. They
			accomplished their objective.
			They have their world back in
			order, and we have our ship.
			It's been some time since I had
			the Conn.
			But, not to worry, Number One
			you're in good hands. Starbase
			74 -- at warp two.
			Engage.
			Under complete control.
			We are all right, everything is
			fine. Now -- I want a complete
			check of all systems and
			divisions.
			What about the Bynars?
			Turn them over to Quinteros.
			There will be a hearing.
			We understood that...
			... would happen.
			That being the case -- permission
			to leave the bridge.
			Permission granted.
			Program entered - you may enter
			the Holodeck.
			What's a knockout like you doin'
			in a computer-generated joint like
			this?
			You're not Minuet.
			She's gone. I tried variations
			of the program, others appeared,
			but not Minuet.
			Maybe that too, was part of the
			Bynar's program. Some
			relationships just can't work.
			Yes... probably true... but, she
			will be difficult to forget.
