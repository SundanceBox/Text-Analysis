			Captain's log, stardate 42353.7.
			Our destination is planet Cygnus
			IV, beyond which lies the great
			unexplored mass of the galaxy.
			My orders are to examine Farpoint,
			a starbase built there by the
			inhabitants of that world.
			Meanwhile ...
			... I am becoming better
			acquainted with my new command,
			this Galaxy Class U.S.S.
			Enterprise.
			I am still somewhat in awe of its
			size and complexity.
			... my crew we are short in
			several key positions, most
			notably ...
			... a first officer, but I am
			informed that a highly experienced
			man, one Commander William Riker,
			will be waiting to join our ship
			when we reach our Cygnus IV
			destination.
			You will agree, Data, that
			Starfleet's instructions are
			difficult?
			Difficult ... how so? Simply
			solve the mystery of Farpoint
			Station.
			As simple as that.
			Farpoint Station. Even the name
			sounds mysterious.
			The problem, Data, is that another
			life form built that base. How
			do I negotiate a friendly
			agreement for Starfleet to use
			it while at the same time snoop
			around finding how and why they
			built it?
			Inquiry ... the word snoop ... ?
			Data, how can you be programmed
			as a virtual encyclopedia of human
			information without knowing a
			simple word like snoop?
			Possibility ... a kind of human
			behavior I was not designed to
			emulate?
			It means 'to spy, to sneak' ...
			Ah! To seek covertly, to go
			stealthily, to slink, slither ...
			Exactly, yes ...
			... to glide, creep, skulk,
			pussyfoot, gumshoe ...
			Captain ... I'm sensing a ... a
			powerful mind ...
			Something strange on the detector
			circuits ...
			It registers as solid, Captain...
			Or an incredibly powerful
			forcefield. But if we collide
			with either ...
			Go to Condition Yellow. And shut
			off that damned noise.
			Shields and deflectors, up, sir.
			Reverse power, full stop.
			Controls to full stop, sir.
			Now reading full stop, sir.
			You are notified that your kind
			has infiltrated the galaxy too
			far already. You are directed
			to return to your own solar system
			immediately.
			That's quite a directive. Would
			you mind identifying what you are?
			We call ourselves "the Q". Or
			you may call me that; it's all
			much the same thing.
			And I have presented myself to
			you as a fellow ship captain so
			that you will better understand
			me.
			Go back from where you...
			Stay where you are!
			Data, call medics!
			He's frozen. Can you feel the
			cold?
			He would not have injured you!
			Do you understand this; the stun
			setting?
			Knowing humans as you do, Captain,
			would you want to be captured
			helpless by them?
			Now, go back or you will certainly
			die!
			Is he still alive?
			For now. We'll do our best, sir.
			Your little centuries go by so
			rapidly, Captain. Perhaps you'll
			understand this better.
			Actually, the issue at stake is
			patriotism. You must return to
			your world and put an end to the
			communists. All it takes is a
			few good men.
			What? That nonsense is centuries
			behind us!
			But you can't deny Captain, that
			you're still a dangerous, savage
			child-race.
			Most certainly I deny it. I agree
			that we still were when ...
			... humans wore costumes like that
			four hundred years ago...
			At which time you slaughtered
			millions in silly arguments about
			how to divide the resources of
			your little world. And four
			hundred years before that you were
			murdering each other in quarrels
			over tribal god-images. And since
			there have been no indications
			that humans will ever change
			.....
			But even as far back as... !
			... that costume, we had begun to
			make rapid progress.
			Oh? Shall we review your "rapid
			progress"?
			Rapid progress to where humans
			learned to control their military
			with drugs.
			Sir, sickbay reports that
			Lieutenant Graham's condition is
			better.
			Concern for one's comrade. How
			touching.
			And now, sir, a personal request.
			Permission to clean up the bridge?
			Lieutenant Worf is right, sir.
			As Security Chief I can't just
			stand here and ....
			Yes, you can, Tasha.
			Ah, yes... better!
			Then later, on finally reaching
			deep space, humans of course found
			enemies to fight out there too.
			And to broaden those struggles....
			.... you again found allies to
			permit still more murdering and
			all over again the same old story.
			No! The most dangerous 'same old
			story' is the one we're meeting
			now! Those who go on
			misinformation, half-information,
			self-righteous life forms who are
			eager not to learn but to
			prosecute, to judge anything they
			don't understand or can't
			tolerate.
			What an interesting idea.
			Prosecute and judge?
			And suppose it turns out we
			understand you humans only too
			well?
			We've no fear of what the true
			facts about us will reveal.
			The facts about you? Splendid,
			splendid! You are a veritable
			fountain of good ideas.
			There are preparations to make,
			Captain, but when I return...
			... we will proceed exactly as you
			suggest!
			Sir... respectfully submit our only
			choice is to fight. If we
			Klingons understand anything, it
			is the meaning of that kind of
			talk.
			My sentiments too, sir. Fight or
			try to escape.
			Sense anything, Commander?
			Its mind is much too powerful,
			sir. And frightening. Concur we
			avoid further contact if possible!
			From this point, no station
			aboard, repeat no station, for
			any reason will make use of
			signals, transmission or intercom.
			We'll try to take them by
			surprise.
			Inform engineering to make ready
			for maximum acceleration. We'll
			find out what this Galaxy Class
			can do.
			Aye, sir.
			Records search, Data. Results
			of detaching the Saucer Section
			at high warp speeds.
			Inadvisable at any warp speed,
			sir.
			Search theoretical.
			It is possible, sir. But
			absolutely no error margin.
			Attention bridge crew!
			Using print-out only, notify all
			decks to prepare for maximum
			acceleration. Maximum, you're
			entitled to know, means we'll be
			pushing our engines well past
			safety limits. Our hope is to
			surprise whatever that is out
			there, try to outrun it.
			Our only other option would be
			to put tail between our legs and
			return to Earth as they demand.
			Engine room ready, sir.
			The board shows 'green', Captain.
			All go!
			Stand by...
			ENGAGE!
			Velocity warp nine point two.
			Heading, 351 Mark 11, sir.
			Steady on that.
			The hostile is now giving chase,
			sir. Accelerating fast.
			We're now at Warp nine point
			three, sir. Which takes us past
			the red line, sir.
			Continue accelerating.
			Counselor, at this point I'm open
			even to guesses about what we've
			just met.
			It... it felt like something beyond
			what we'd consider a 'life form'.
			'Beyond'?
			Very, very advanced, sir. Or...
			Or certainly, very, very
			different!
			Sir, we're at warp nine point
			four.
			Hostile is now beginning to
			overtake us, sir.
			Are you sure?
			Hostile's velocity is already warp
			nine point six, sir. Shall I
			put them on main viewer?
			Reverse angle on viewer.
			Magnifying viewer image.
			Hostile's velocity now at nine
			point seven, sir.
			Ops, inform Engineering we need
			more!
			Engine room attempting to comply,
			sir. But they caution us...
			Go to yellow alert!
			Arm photon torpedoes, Weapons
			Station. Place them on ready
			status.
			Torpedoes to ready, sir.
			That was a design tremor, sir.
			A warning.
			Hostile now at warp nine point
			eight, sir.
			Our velocity is only nine point
			five, sir.
			Projection, sir. We may be able
			to match the hostile's nine point
			eight, sir. But at extreme risk.
			Now reading the hostile at warp
			nine point nine, sir.
			Attention bridge. Print-out
			message, urgent, to all decks.
			All stations on all decks, make
			ready to detach ship's saucer
			section.
			You will command the saucer
			section, Lieutenant.
			I am a Klingon, sir. For me to
			seek escape while my captain goes
			into battle....
			You are a Starfleet officer,
			Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			Note in ship's log that at this
			startime, I am transferring
			command to the Battle Bridge.
			Make the signal, Data.
			Captain's log, stardate 42354.1.
			Preparing to detach saucer
			section.
			... so that families and the majority
			of the ship's company...
			... can seek relative safety while
			our vessel's stardrive, containing
			our Battle Bridge...
			... and main armaments, will turn
			back and confront the mystery that
			is threatening us.
			Lieutenant, your torpedoes must
			detonate close enough to the
			hostile to blind it at the moment
			we separate.
			Understood, sir.
			Worf, this is the Captain....
			Yes Captain?
			Begin countdown....
			Mark!
			All decks acknowledging, sir.
			Starship separation.... six, five,
			four, three, two, one....
			Ship's log, exact moment of
			separation, stardate 42354.22.
			All torpedoes have detonated, sir.
			Reverse power and hold this
			position.
			Reverse power...decelerating.
			That will bring them here in just
			minutes, sir.
			Will we make a fight of it,
			Captain? If we can at least
			damage their ship....
			Lieutenant... are you recommending
			we fight a life form that can do
			all those things?
			I'd like to hear your advice.
			I... spoke before I thought, sir.
			We should look for some way to
			distract them from going after
			the saucer.
			All forward motion stopped, sir.
			Commander, signal the following
			in all languages and on all
			frequencies: we surrender. State
			that we are not asking for any
			terms or conditions.
			Aye, sir. All language forms and
			frequencies.
			Historically intriguing, Captain.
			Very, very accurate.
			Mid-21st Century, the post-atomic
			horror....
			All present, make respectful
			attention to honored Judge!
			Careful, sir. This is not an
			illusion or a dream.
			But these courts happened in our
			past....
			I don't understand either, but
			this is real. I can feel that!
			Get to your feet, criminals!
			At least we are acquainted with
			the judge, Captain.
			Attention! On your feet,
			attention!
			You are out of order!
			The prisoners will not be
			harmed...
			Until they are found guilty, of
			course.
			Dispose of that.
			Can we assume you mean this will
			be a fair trial?
			Yes, absolutely equitable.
			Proceed.
			Before this gracious court now
			appear these humans to answer for
			the multiple and grievous
			savageries of their species.
			How plead you, criminal?
			If I may, Captain....
			Objection, your honor. In the
			year 2016, the new United Nations
			declared that no Earth citizen
			could be made to answer for the
			crimes of their race or
			forbearers.
			Objection denied!
			This is a court of the year 2049,
			by which time more 'rapid
			progress' had caused all 'United
			Earth' nonsense to be abolished.
			Tasha, no...
			I must... 
			... because I grew up on a world
			that allowed things like this
			court. And it was people like
			these that saved me from it. I
			say that this so-called court
			should get down on its knees to
			what Starfleet is, what it
			represents... 
			You barbarian! That girl....
			Criminals keep silence!
			You've got a lot to learn about
			humans if you think you can
			torture us or frighten us into
			silence.
			Are they still alive?
			Uncertain. Lieutenant Graham was
			when our medics thawed him out.
			You will answer the charges!
			Or what? Or this, or worse? Or
			death? I suggest you take a
			better look at human history.
			You are charged, criminals. How
			plead you?
			Just a moment ago, you promised
			"the prisoners will not be
			harmed." We plead nothing so long
			as you break your own rules.
			I suggest you center your
			attention on the trial, Captain.
			It may be your only hope.
			And I suggest you now may be
			having second thoughts about this
			trial! You're considering that
			if you conduct it fairly, which
			was your promise, you may lose.
			Lose?
			Yes, even though you're judge, and
			prosecutor....
			And jury.
			Accepted... so long as you keep
			to your agreement.
			And assaulting prisoners is hardly
			a fair trial.
			This is a merciful court.
			SILENCE!
			Continuing these proceedings, I
			must caution you that legal
			trickery is not permitted. This
			is a court of fact!
			... court of fact!
			We humans know our past, even when
			we're ashamed of it. I recognize
			this court system as the one which
			agreed with Shakespeare's
			suggestion -- "Kill all the
			lawyers".
			Which humans did.
			Which led to the rule: "Guilty
			until proven innocent".
			Of course. Bringing the innocent
			to trial would be unfair.
			YOU WILL NOW ANSWER TO THE
			GRIEVOUS SAVAGERY CHARGE AGAINST
			HUMANITY.
			We'll be happy to answer specific
			charges. "Grievous savagery" could
			mean anything.
			Obviously it means causing harm
			to fellow creatures!
			Such as you did when you froze
			a member of our bridge crew? Will
			you be joining us in the dock
			here?
			You fool. Are you certain you
			want a full disclosure of human
			ugliness?
			So be it! Present the charges.
			Criminal, you will read the
			charges to the court.
			I see no charges against us, your
			honor.
			Criminal, you are out of order!
			Soldiers...
			... you will press those triggers
			if this criminal answers with any
			word other than "guilty"...
			Criminal, how plead you?
			Guilty...
			... provisionally so.
			The Court will hear the provision.
			We question whether this court
			is abiding by its own trial
			instructions. Do I have
			permission to have Commander Data
			repeat the record?
			If this is legal trickery...
			Your own words, your Honor.
			Exactly what followed his Honor's
			statement that the prisoner would
			not be harmed?
			Yes, sir. The Captain has asked
			the question...
			"Can we assume this will be a fair
			trial?"
			And in reply, the judge stated...
			"Yes, absolutely equitable."
			Unacceptable testimony, entirely
			unacceptable... !
			If your Honor pleases, there is
			a simple way to clear up this
			disagreement.
			We agree there is evidence to
			support the court's contention
			that humans have been murderous
			and dangerous.
			I say "have been" ... and
			therefore we will respectfully
			submit to a test of whether this
			is presently true of humans.
			I see, I see.
			And you petition the Court to
			accept you and your comrades as
			proof of what humanity has become.
			There should be many ways we can
			be tested. We have a long mission
			ahead of us...
			Another brilliant suggestion,
			Captain. But your test hardly
			requires a 'long mission'.
			Your immediate destination offers
			more challenge than you can
			possibly imagine. Yes, yes, this
			Farpoint station will be an
			excellent test of human worth.
			Stand respectfully. All present,
			respectfully stand!
			This trial is adjourned to allow
			the criminals to be tested.
			This honorable court is adjourned!
			Captain, you may find you are not
			nearly clever enough to deal with
			what lies ahead for you. It may
			have been better to accept
			sentence here.
			Uh... what is present course, Ops?
			It's exactly what the Captain
			ordered, sir. Direct heading to
			Farpoint Station.
			Confirm we are on that heading,
			sir.
			Know anything about Farpoint?
			It sounds like a fairly dull
			place.
			Actually, Ops, I've heard just
			the opposite.
			Personal log, Commander William
			Riker, Star Date 42354.4, at
			Farpoint Station.
			... U.S.S. Hood has dropped me
			off at Farpoint Station where I
			await the arrival of the new
			U.S.S. Enterprise...
			... to which I have been assigned
			as first officer. Meanwhile...
			... I have been asked to visit
			the office of Farpoint Station's
			Administrator.
			I thought you might like to know,
			Commander Riker, that we've still
			no word from your vessel. But,
			I trust we have made your waiting
			comfortable?
			Luxurious is more like it. Would
			it seem ungrateful if I ask for
			some information?
			Anything!
			Fascinating how in the midst of
			an old city like this, you've
			built a completely modern
			tritanium and duraglass space
			station. Your energy supply must
			be as abundant as I've heard.
			Geothermal energy is the one great
			blessing of this planet. I'll
			have all the details of that sent
			to your quarters.
			Thank you. But it still seems
			incredible how you've built this
			station so rapidly and so... so
			perfectly suited to our needs.
			Would your care for an Earth
			delicacy, Commander?
			Well, if there's an apple there...
			It doesn't matter... what I was
			saying was...
			Well, I'll be damned!
			Ah... ah yes, there was another
			selection here...
			Zorn, I would have sworn it wasn't
			here a moment ago.
			And does your failure to notice
			it make it unwelcome?
			The same with Farpoint Station,
			Commander.
			We hope a few easily answered
			questions about it won't make
			Starfleet appreciate it less.
			I'm sure it won't, sir.
			And this is delicious. Thank you.
			Good morning, Groppler Zorn.
			Good morning.
			You've been told not to do that.
			Why can't you understand? It will
			arouse their suspicions.
			... and if that happens, we will
			have to punish you. We will, I
			promise you. We must!
			Doctor Crusher...
			Mother, it's Commander Riker.
			And hello to you, Wesley.
			Enjoying Farpoint Station?
			Yes, sir.
			Saw you and thought I'd join your
			stroll, if I may.
			Actually, we're about to do some
			shopping.
			I've been meaning to visit the
			mall myself. If I'm welcome?
			Of course.
			If you're wondering about Mom,
			Mister Riker, she's isn't actually
			unfriendly. She's just shy around
			men she doesn't know.
			Wesley... !
			I believe that means he would like
			us to be friends.
			I'm willing, Doctor.
			And although we're not officially
			part of the Enterprise yet, I
			thought there might be something
			useful we could do while we wait.
			"Useful"? How and what,
			Commander?
			Investigating some things I've
			noticed here, Doctor. The last
			was a piece of fruit...
			Would this be available in emerald
			green?
			I'm sure, Commander, there are
			reasons for a first officer to
			want to demonstrate his energy
			and alertness to a new captain.
			But since my duty and interests
			are outside the command
			structure...
			Isn't it nice he happened to have
			the right color?
			Thank you. I'll take the entire
			bolt. Charge it to Beverly
			Crusher, Chief Medical Officer,
			USS Enterprise.
			Let's see, where were we?
			I was accusing you of inventing
			work in order to curry favor with
			your new captain. I apologize.
			Finding the exact right color took
			him only about twelve seconds,
			Mom.
			Maybe this is something Jean-Luc
			Picard will want looked into.
			Jean-Luc? You know Captain
			Picard?
			When I was little, he brought my
			father's body home to us.
			Yes, Wes, long, long ago.
			Shall we continue the walk? I'd
			like to know you better, Mister
			Riker.
			Where is she? They say she's
			never late -- not since the old
			burrhog took over the captain's
			chair.
			You wouldn't be talking about the
			Enterprise, would you, Ensign
			Markham?
			Sir. Yes, sir.
			You can stand at ease, gentlemen.
			We're not on the Enterprise yet.
			You know we're assigned to her,
			sir.
			Riker. I'm slated to be First
			Officer.
			I read the service records on all
			new personnel on the trip out.
			Excellent academic record at
			Starfleet Academy, Mister Markham.
			Thank you, sir.
			And you, Mister LaForge. Captain
			Dreyer praised your performance
			on the Hood. Why did you request
			transfer to the Enterprise?
			Who wouldn't, sir? The biggest,
			newest, fastest starship in the
			fleet --
			Commanded by the best burrhog in
			the fleet. Right, Mister Markham?
			Yes, sir.
			I've already forgotten who used
			those words.
			Shouldn't we have heard something
			from her by now, sir?
			Commander Riker?
			Yes?
			The Enterprise has been picked
			up on our monitors, sir. I should
			tell you, sir, it is only the
			Stardrive Section.
			What about the Saucer Module?
			We've received no explanation,
			sir. But the captain signals that
			you're to beam up immediately.
			Our new captain doesn't waste
			time.
			A good rule for all of us to
			follow, gentlemen.
			Enterprise, this is Commander
			Riker on Farpoint. Standing by
			to beam up.
			Lieutenant Yar of Security, sir.
			Captain Picard will see you on
			the Battle Bridge.
			Battle bridge.
			With the saucer gone, can I assume
			something interesting happened
			on your way here?
			I'll let the captain explain, sir.
			We are cleared into the standard
			parking orbit, sir.
			Make it so.
			Commander Riker, sir.
			Riker, W.T., reporting as ordered,
			sir.
			I really didn't expect to welcome
			you to half a starship, Riker.
			Is the viewer ready?
			All set up, sir.
			We'll first bring you up to date
			on a little... "adventure" we had
			on our way here, Commander. Then
			we'll talk.
			This way, sir.
			Message from the Saucer Module.
			It will arrive here in fifty-one
			minutes, sir.
			Inform them we'll hook up as soon
			as they arrive.
			Bring him to my Ready Room when
			he's done there.
			He calls that "a little
			adventure"?
			Come.
			Wow!
			Exactly.
			This "Q", sir... is he crazy?
			I mean, seriously?
			Seriously, does it really matter
			how we judge them? We're dealing
			with something that can juggle
			starships as if they were pebbles.
			It's a rather astonishing "little
			adventure" you've had, Captain.
			The issue isn't what we call it,
			Commander. The important thing
			is we can be dead certain...
			accent on dead... that "Q" wasn't
			joking. We're alive only because
			we were placed on "probation",
			a very serious kind of
			"probation".
			Go.
			The Saucer Module is now entering
			orbit with us, sir.
			Acknowledged. Commander Riker will
			conduct a manual docking. Picard
			out.
			Sir?
			You've reported in, haven't you?
			You are qualified?
			Yes, sir.
			Then I meant now, Mister Riker.
			You say you will be doing this
			manually, sir? No automation?
			As ordered.
			Two percent rise. Up angle
			adjustment three degrees.
			Maintain docking speed.
			Level her out. Maintain docking
			speed. Docking crew, prepare for
			reconnection.
			All stop. Her inertia should do
			the job now.
			Rejoin lock-up... now.
			Enterprise log, First Officer
			entry. Ship's modules rejoined,
			stardate 42354.71 with command
			now transferred back to the main
			bridge.
			Neatly done, sir.
			I don't imagine many mistakes
			happen under Captain Picard.
			No sir, they don't.
			I'm Lieutenant Worf, sir. Captain
			Picard requests you come
			immediately to his quarters.
			Come!
			A fairly routine maneuver but you
			handled it quite well.
			Thank you, sir. I hope I show
			some promise.
			Some coffee.
			No thank you, sir.
			And now I have a kind of "what
			sort of second-in-command have
			I inherited?" question.
			Yes sir, I thought you might.
			I noticed in your envelope that
			Captain DeSoto thinks very highly
			of you. One curious thing,
			however, you refused to let him
			beam down to Altair IV?
			In my opinion, sir, Altair IV was
			too dangerous to risk exposing
			the captain.
			I see. A captain's rank means
			nothing to you.
			Rather the reverse, sir. A
			captain's life means a great deal
			to me.
			Let me postulate something here,
			Mister Riker. Isn't it just possible
			that you don't get to be a
			starship captain without knowing
			when it's safe to beam down or
			not? Isn't it a little
			presumptuous for a first officer
			to second guess his captain's
			judgment?
			Permission to speak candidly, sir?
			Always.
			You've been a first officer
			yourself. You know that assuming
			that responsibility must, by
			definition, include the safety
			of the captain. I have no problem
			with following the rules you lay
			down. But under no circumstances
			will I compromise your safety.
			If you have a problem with that,
			sir, you can put me back on the
			Hood before she leaves.
			You don't intend to back off that
			position?
			No, sir, I can't.
			One further thing... a special
			favor I have to ask of you.
			Anything, sir.
			Using the same kind of strength
			you showed with Captain DeSoto,
			I'd appreciate it if you can keep
			me from making an ass of myself
			with children.
			Sir?
			I'm not a family man, Riker, and
			yet, Starfleet has given me a ship
			with children aboard.
			Yes, sir. And families...
			And I don't feel comfortable with
			children. But, since a captain
			needs an image of "geniality"
			toward the little monsters, you're
			to see that's exactly what I
			project.
			Aye, sir.
			Welcome to the Enterprise, Mister
			Riker.
			Yes sir, Commander?
			Thank you, Lieutenant. Is
			Commander Data on duty?
			Commander Data is on a special
			assignment, sir. He's using our
			shuttlecraft to transfer an
			admiral over to the Hood.
			An admiral?
			He's been aboard all day, sir,
			checking over medical layout.
			Why the shuttlecraft? Can he just
			beam over?
			I suppose he could, sir. But the
			admiral's a rather remarkable man.
			But, sir, the transporter could
			have you on the Hood in a matter
			of seconds, Admiral.
			Have you got some reason to want
			my atoms scattered all over space?
			No sir. But at your age, sir,
			I thought you shouldn't have to
			put up with the time and trouble
			of a shuttlecraft.
			My age? Hold it right there, boy,
			what about my age?
			Sorry, sir. If that subject
			troubles you...
			Troubles me? What's so damned
			troubling about not having died?
			How old do you think I am?
			One hundred forty-seven years,
			Admiral. According to Starfleet
			records.
			Explain how you remember that so
			exactly.
			I remember every fact I am exposed
			to, sir.
			I don't see any points on your
			ears, boy, but you sound like a
			Vulcan.
			No, sir. I am an android.
			Almost as bad.
			I thought it was generally
			accepted, sir, that Vulcans are
			an advanced and most honorable
			race.
			They are, boy. They are. And
			also damned annoying at times.
			Yes, sir.
			This is a new ship, boy, but she's
			got the right name. Remember
			that.
			I will, sir.
			You treat her like a lady.
			She'll always bring you home...
			Show me the results of Captain
			Picard's most recent physical
			examination.
			Already at work, Doctor?
			Yes, on a subject that's very
			important to this mission,
			Captain.
			Screen off.
			I wanted to say "welcome aboard."
			Thank you, Captain.
			And I thought I should talk to
			you very personally about your
			assignment here.
			I wanted you to know I protested
			your posting to the Enterprise.
			Oh? Do you consider me
			unqualified?
			Hardly. Your service record shows
			you exactly the kind of CMO I'd
			want.
			Then you must object to me
			personally. Has it to do with
			our last meeting?
			I'm trying to be considerate of
			your feelings, Doctor Crusher.
			For you to serve with a commanding
			officer who would continually
			remind you of such a terrible
			personal tragedy...
			If I had any objections to serving
			with you, I wouldn't have
			requested this assignment,
			Captain.
			You requested this posting?
			Captain. My feelings about my
			husband's death will have no
			effect on the way I serve you,
			this vessel, or this mission.
			Then, welcome aboard, Doctor.
			I'm pleased to have you here.
			Thank you. And now, if I can
			return to my duties...
			Well... as I said, "welcome
			Aboard".
			Have you signaled the Hood, Mister
			Riker?
			Your exact message.
			Bon voyage mon amie. Aye, sir.
			And what was my answer, computer?
			DO YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT PATIENTLY
			THROUGH ALL THIS NONSENSE? OR
			DID YOU THINK I WAS GONE?
			Do you intend to blast a hole
			through the viewer, Lieutenant?
			If the purpose of this is to test
			human worth, your honor, you must
			let us proceed in a normal human
			way.
			YOU ARE DILATORY! YOU HAVE
			TWENTY-FOUR HOURS! ANY FURTHER
			DELAY AND YOU RISK SUMMARY
			JUDGEMENT AGAINST YOU, CAPTAIN.
			Sorry, sir...
			No criticism. You reacted fast...
			... but in a completely useless
			way.
			I'll learn to do better, sir.
			Of course you will. We've a long
			voyage ahead of us.
			Hope you're right, sir. About
			the long voyage ahead.
			I hope so too.
			What do we do, sir? With them
			monitoring every move, every
			word...
			S.O.P., Mister Riker.
			Standard Operating Procedures?
			We do exactly what we'd do if this
			"Q" never existed. If we're going
			to be damned, let's be damned for
			what we really are.
			Captain's log, stardate 42372.5.
			Of the twenty-four hours "Q"
			allotted us to prove ourselves...
			... eleven have now passed without
			incident. And yet I cannot forget
			"Q's" prediction that we will face
			here some critical test of human
			worth.
			This planet's interior heat
			results in abundant geothermal
			energy, sir. But it's about all
			this world does offer.
			And it's your belief that this
			is what made it possible for them
			to construct this base to
			Starfleet standards?
			Yes sir. We have to assume that
			they've been trading their surplus
			energy for the construction
			materials used here. According
			to our ship's scans, many of the
			materials used are not found on
			this world.
			Perhaps it's like those incidents
			you describe in your report as
			"almost magical" attempts to
			please us.
			Those events did happen, sir.
			And in time we'll discover the
			explanation. Meanwhile, none of
			it suggests anything threatening.
			If only every life form had as
			much desire to please Starfleet.
			Ready to beam down? I'm looking
			forward to meeting this Groppler
			Zorn.
			I'm convinced there's more to it
			than just "pleasing us", sir.
			Like something "Q" is doing to
			trick us?
			Over here, Counselor!
			I've asked her to join us in this
			meeting.
			May I introduce our new first
			officer, Commander William Riker.
			Mister Riker, our ship's
			counselor, Deanna Troi.
			Do you remember what I taught you,
			Izmadi? Can you still sense my
			thoughts?
			A pleasure, Commander.
			I, ah... likewise, Counselor.
			Have the two of you met before?
			We... we have, sir.
			Excellent. I consider it
			important that my key officers
			know each other's abilities.
			We do, sir; we do.
			I, too, would never say goodbye,
			Izmadi.
			My crew and I need a bit more
			information...
			... before we make our
			recommendations to Starfleet.
			No objections to that, but...
			... but I'm puzzled over your
			bringing a Betazoid to this. If
			her purpose here is to probe my
			thoughts, sir...
			I can sense only strong emotions,
			Groppler. I am only half Betazoid;
			my father was a Starfleet officer.
			I have nothing to hide, of course.
			Good, since we admire what we've
			seen of your construction
			techniques. Starfleet may be
			interested in your constructing
			starbases elsewhere too.
			Unfortunately, Captain, we are
			not interested in building other
			facilities.
			If I may, Captain...
			Then a trade, Groppler? Some
			things you need in return for the
			loan of architects and engineers
			who can demonstrate your
			techniques.
			We Bandi do not wish to leave our
			home world. If Starfleet cannot
			accept that small weakness, then
			we will be forced, unhappily, to
			seek an alliance with someone like
			the Ferengi, or...
			Counselor... ? What is it?
			Do you want it described here,
			sir?
			Yes! No secrets here if we're
			all to be friends.
			Agreed, Groppler?
			We ourselves have nothing to hide,
			but...
			Pain... pain, loneliness, terrible
			loneliness, despair...
			I'm not sensing him, sir. Or any
			of his people... but it's
			something very close to this location.
			The source of this? Do you have
			any idea?
			No!
			No, absolutely not. And I find
			nothing helpful or productive in
			any of this!
			That's it? No other comment?
			What do you expect form us? We
			offer a base designed to your
			needs, luxurious even by human
			standards...
			... while refusing to answer even
			our simplest questions about it.
			We'll adjourn for now...
			... while we all reconsider our
			positions.
			Captain, the Ferengi would be very
			interested in a base like this.
			Fine. I hope they find you as
			tasty as their other past
			associates.
			Ensign, can you help me find
			Commander Data? I was told he's
			somewhere on this deck.
			This way, sir.
			You must be new to these galaxy
			class starships, sir.
			Tell me the location of Commander
			Data.
			Lieutenant Commander Data... now
			located in Holodeck area 4-J.
			And as you see, sir, it's pointing
			you that way.
			Go that way? How far?
			You'll know, sir.
			This way, please. The next
			hatchway on your right.
			Thank you...
			You're more than welcome,
			Commander Riker.
			And if you care to enter,
			Commander...
			I do.
			Hello!
			Marvelous how easily humans do
			that, sir. I still need much
			practice.
			There are some puzzles down on
			the planet that Captain Picard
			wants answered. He suggests I
			put you on the away team I'll be
			using.
			I shall endeavor to give
			satisfaction, sir.
			Uh, yes. And when the captain
			suggested you I, uh, looked up
			your record...
			Yes sir, a wise procedure always.
			Your rank of lieutenant commander,
			I assume now must be honorary.
			No, sir. Starfleet Class of '78;
			honors in quantum mathematics
			and exobiology.
			But your files... they say you're
			a...
			Machine? Correct, sir. Does that
			trouble you?
			To be honest... yes, a little.
			Understood, sir. Prejudice is
			very human.
			Now that troubles me. Do you
			consider yourself superior to us?
			I am superior in many ways. But
			I would gladly give it up to be
			human.
			Nice to meet you, Pinocchio,
			A joke.
			Ah! Intriguing.
			You're going to be an interesting
			companion, Mister Data.
			This pattern is quite popular,
			sir. Perhaps because it
			duplicates Earth so well, Coming
			here,
			makes me feel as if I'm human too.
			I didn't believe these could be
			so real.
			Much of it is real, sir. If the
			transporters can convert our
			bodies to an energy beam, then
			back to the original pattern
			again...
			Yes, of course.
			And all these have much simpler
			patterns.
			The rear wall.
			I can't see it.
			You will.
			Incredible!
			Mister Riker, isn't this great?
			This is one of the simpler
			patterns, Mister Riker. They've
			got thousands more, some you just
			can't believe.
			Careful, that next rock is
			loose... !
			Wow!
			Mister Data has agreed to join
			my away team, Captain.
			Very good.
			Sir, maybe I should get something
			to wipe this water up.
			Good idea.
			-- and there's a low gravity
			gymnasium, too. It would be hard
			to get bored on this ship.
			Mom...
			could you get me a look at the
			bridge?
			That's against the captain's
			standing orders.
			Are you afraid of the captain,
			too?
			I certainly am not!
			But Captain Picard is a pain,
			isn't he?
			Your father liked him very much.
			Great explorers are often lonely,
			... no chance to have a family...
			Just a look, at the bridge, Mom.
			From the turbolift when the doors
			open. I wouldn't get off. I
			promise.
			You're looking for trouble, Wes.
			Let's see what we can do.
			Recommend that someone could begin
			by examining the underside of the
			station, sir.
			Our sensors do show some passages
			down there, sir. Perhaps you and
			I?
			Tasha, you and the Counselor.
			Let's us start with the topside.
			Have you noticed anything unusual?
			Well, I can't see through solid
			matter, sir, but the material so
			far looks very ordinary.
			Confirmed by the construction
			records, sir. Almost exactly the
			same material that Starfleet uses.
			Riker to Tasha, Troi, come in!
			We were about to call you, Team
			Leader. We've found something
			interesting.
			We're in a passageway directly
			under the station sir. But the
			tunnel walls here are make from
			something we've never seen before.
			And Troi, have you sensed anything
			there?
			Sir, I've avoided opening my mind.
			Whatever I sensed in the
			Groppler's office became very
			painful.
			I'm sorry, Counselor, but you
			must. We need more information.
			No, no, such pain. It's so close to
			us here... pain, pain..
			Hang on, I'm coming... Enterprise,
			lock us onto her signal!
			I'm sorry. Close your mind from
			the pain...
			It's also unhappiness... terrible
			despair...
			Who?
			I don't know! No lifeform anything
			like us.
			What in the hell kind of place
			is this?
			Geordi, what do you see?
			It's of no material I recognize,
			sir. Or have even heard of.
			Permission to report to the
			captain...
			Children are not allowed on the
			bridge, Doctor.
			Captain, my son is not on the
			bridge. He merely accompanied
			me on the turbolift.
			Your son?
			His name's Wesley. You last saw
			him years ago when...
			Oh, back then.
			Well -- as long as he's here...
			I knew your father, Wesley. Want
			a look around?
			But don't touch anything!
			Try it out.
			The panel on your right is for
			log entries, library-computer
			access and retrieval, viewscreen
			control, intercoms, and so on.
			Yes sir. And here, the backup conn
			and ops panels, plus armament and
			shield controls.
			The forward viewscreen is
			controlled by the ops position...
			Yes sir, which uses high
			resolution, multi-spectral imaging
			sensor systems...
			How the hell do you know that,
			boy?
			Perimeter alert, Captain!
			Off the bridge! Both of you.
			You have a perimeter alert,
			Captain.
			As my son tried to tell you!
			Picard. Go ahead.
			Ship's sensors have detected the
			presence of a vessel approaching
			this planet. No ship is scheduled
			to arrive at this time.
			Have Mister Riker, and his team
			beamed back up! Security, could
			that be the Hood returning here?
			The vessel does not match the
			Hood's configuration or I.D.
			signal.
			Put it on main viewer!
			Identification?
			Vessel unknown, configuration
			unknown, sir.
			Hail it!
			We've been trying, sir. No
			response.
			Raise all shields, phasers at
			ready.
			Shields up, sir. Phasers ready.
			Could this be that "Q" you
			mentioned, sir?
			I almost hope so, Lieutenant.
			We face too many "unknowns"
			already.
			Continue universal greeting on
			all frequencies. Get me Groppler
			Zorn.
			This is Zorn, Captain.
			There is an unidentified vessel
			moving into orbit with us. Do you
			know who it is?
			There are no ships scheduled to
			arrive until --
			I asked if you know who it is,
			Groppler. You mentioned the
			Ferengi Alliance to me.
			But we have had no dealings with
			them. It was only a... a
			thought.
			Are you very, very certain of
			that, Groppler?
			I promise you we were making an
			empty threat, Captain. I wanted
			your cooperation. Forgive me --
			Definitely entering an orbital
			trajectory, sir.
			It measures half again our size,
			Captain.
			All stations, give any damage
			reports.
			I would guess we were being
			scanned, sir.
			Pain again?
			Troi, you've been at it enough!
			No, I feel close to an answer of
			some kind.
			Commander, something down here
			is shielding our communicators.
			Yes, that's exactly the feeling
			I've been reading. As if someone
			doesn't want us to be in touch
			with our ship.
			Come on...
			... let's get to the surface.
			There is no computer record of
			any such vessel, sir. Not even
			close.
			Still no response, sir. We've
			done everything but threaten them.
			Sensor scans, Mister Worf.
			Our sensor signals seem to just
			bounce off.
			Something's happening, sir...
			They're firing on Farpoint,
			sir... !
			Bring phasers and photon torpedoes
			to ready!
			No, hold it, sir. They're hitting
			the Bandi city, not Farpoint
			Station.
			Those stairs are where Tasha and
			I entered down here, sir.
			At this point, it becomes ordinary
			stone and tile, sir.
			Matching what's above.
			My God! Was that a phaser blast?
			Negative. But something similar.
			You, Tasha, and Geordi will beam
			up to the ship from here. Now!
			Come on, I want to see exactly
			what's happening.
			Don't. If you should be hurt...
			You have your orders, Counselor!
			Carry them out!
			Yes sir, I'm sorry, sir.
			Enterprise, three to beam up.
			Enterprise, Riker. Come in.
			Enterprise, Enterprise, help us!
			Come in, please...
			... what shall we do? Help us,
			please.
			Tune him down!
			Commander Riker, go ahead. Where
			are you?
			With Data, on the edge of the old
			city, Captain. It's being hit
			hard. Who's doing this?
			And Farpoint Station? Any damage
			there?
			Negative on damage to Farpoint,
			sir. Whoever they are, it seems
			they're carefully avoiding hitting
			the station.
			It's from an unidentified vessel
			that's entered orbit with us here.
			No ID, no answer to our signals...
			They're hitting the Bandi city
			hard, sir. Many casualties very
			probable.
			Understand, Commander. Would you
			object to a clearly illegal
			kidnapping assignment?
			No objection; anything you order,
			sir.
			Zorn may have the answers we need.
			Get Groppler Zorn and bring him
			here!
			Aye, sir!
			They're forcing a difficult
			decision on me, Counselor.
			But, I doubt protecting the Bandi
			would violate the Prime Directive.
			True, they are not actual
			allies...
			But we are in the midst of
			diplomatic discussions with them.
			Lock phasers on that vessel,
			Lieutenant.
			Phasers locked on, Captain.
			Typical, so typical. Savage
			lifeforms never follow even their
			own rules.
			Get off my bridge!
			Also interesting, that order about
			phasers.
			Still standing by on phasers,
			Captain.
			Please don't let me interfere.
			Use your weapons.
			You're the one who has a lot to
			learn, "Q". With no idea of who's
			on that vessel, my order was a
			routine safety precaution.
			Really? No idea of what it
			represents? The meaning of that
			vessel is as plain as...
			... as plain as the noses on your
			ugly little primate faces.
			And if you were truly civilized,
			Captain, wouldn't you be doing
			something about the casualties
			happening down there?
			Captain to CMO, are you reading
			any of this?
			Medical teams already preparing
			to beam down, Captain.
			Compliments on that, Doctor!
			Any questions? Starfleet people
			are trained to render aid and
			assistance whenever...
			But not trained in clear thinking.
			Let's consider your thoughts.
			You call us "savages" and yet you
			knew those people down there would
			be killed. You're the one whose
			conduct is uncivilized.
			Sir, they're firing on the planet
			again.
			Forcefields full on.
			Go to thrusters! Position us
			between that vessel and the
			planet.
			Aye, sir, thruster power to...
			We have no ship control, sir.
			It's gone!
			Are you undamaged?
			Yes. You?
			All systems operating.
			Please. You can make it stop.
			Drive it away.
			Drive who away, Groppler?
			I don't know.
			Unlikely, sir.
			Our records show that you
			supervised all Bandi contact with
			other worlds...
			We haven't done anything wrong!
			Then if we can learn nothing from
			you, perhaps we'll leave.
			No! No, don't leave, I'll try
			to explain some of...
			First officer to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Riker.
			We've lost Zorn, sir. Something
			like a transporter beam, it
			snatched him out of here.
			Question, sir, could it have been
			the "Q" character you met earlier.
			None of you know who it is?
			You're running out of time,
			Captain.
			Captain... Suddenly I'm sensing
			something else. It's
			satisfaction, enormous
			satisfaction.
			From the same source as before?
			No, that was on the planet.
			This seems to be from here.
			Excellent, Counselor!
			He's such a dullard, isn't he!
			Captain from Transporter Room.
			First officer and Mister Data now
			beaming aboard.
			Excellent also!
			Perhaps with more of these little
			minds helping, you'll...
			That is enough, damn it!
			We have an agreement; have you
			forgotten... ?
			We have an agreement which you
			are at this moment breaking by
			taking over our vessel,
			interfering with my decisions!
			You are not welcome on my bridge.
			Now, either leave or finish us.
			One of the two!
			Temper, temper, mon capitaine. I
			am merely trying to assist a
			pitiful species. Perhaps I'll
			leave if Mister Riker provides
			me with some amusement.
			Do nothing that he asks!
			But I ask so little. And it is
			so necessary if you are to solve
			all this.
			Beam over there with your... what
			is it called... your "away team"?
			You should already know what
			you'll find there. But perhaps
			it was too adult a puzzle for you.
			Captain, with all respect, I
			intended to suggest beaming over
			there.
			You show promise, my good fellow.
			But you don't. You should have
			long ago realized that, humanity
			is NOT a criminal race!
			YOU MUST STILL PROVE THAT!
			Of the 24 hours "Q" gave us, we have
			less than one left, sir.
			But I had a feeling you impressed
			him, Number One. That's hopeful.
			Thank you, Captain, That's the
			first time you've called me
			"Number One".
			I believe I'll enjoy getting to
			know you, Bill. If we live long
			enough.
			Phasers on stun.
			Energize.
			Most interesting, sir.
			Much the same construction as the
			underground tunnel we saw.
			But no sound of power; no
			equipment. How does this ship
			run?
			Troi, what is it?!
			Is it the same as you felt down
			there?
			No, this is... different. It
			feels much more powerful... full
			of anger... hate...
			Toward us?
			No. It's directed down toward
			the old Bandi city.
			Most intriguing again. The place
			that this vessel was firing
			upon...
			Sorry, sir, I seem to be
			commenting on everything.
			Good. Don't stop it, my friend.
			Enterprise, Riker. This is
			turning out to be a very long
			tunnel or corridor, sir. Still
			no sign of mechanism or
			circuitry...
			... or controls, readouts, nothing
			at all like any vessel I've seen
			before.
			Groppler Zorn, sir... in great
			fear...
			Just ahead.
			It's definitely Zorn, Commander.
			Here!
			Careful...
			Troi!!!
			No! Please! No more! Please,
			no more...
			Zorn. Can you hear me?
			Make it stop the pain. Please...
			Has the alien communicated... ?
			That's it, sir! It's just one
			alien that I'm sensing here.
			Please! I don't understand what
			it wants.
			Not true. He does know.
			No, no, please don't!
			Away team to Enterprise...
			Troi... !
			Enterprise, come in. Beam us...
			Enterprise, we need help...
			Transporter chief, yank them back!
			Now!
			Captain... !
			Your time is up, Captain.
			Get off my bridge!
			Transporter Chief, do you have
			their coordinates?
			He can't hear you, Captain.
			"Q", I've people in trouble over
			there... !
			Everyone, at ease! That's an
			order!
			My people are in trouble, "Q".
			Help them; I'll do whatever you
			say...
			You'll do whatever I say?
			It seems I did make that bargain.
			The agreement isn't valid, sir.
			It wasn't "Q" that saved us.
			Save yourselves! It may attack
			you now.
			It was that which sent us back,
			Captain.
			Yes sir. It's not a vessel, sir.
			It's alive somehow...
			She lies! Destroy it while you
			have a chance.
			Make phasers and photon torpedoes
			ready... !
			No! Do nothing he suggests!
			But that thing was killing my
			people, Captain...
			True, but why? Was there a
			reason?
			It is an unknown, Captain! Isn't
			that enough?
			If you had earned that uniform
			you're wearing, you'd know that
			the unknown is what brings us out
			here!
			Wasted effort, considering the
			human intelligence.
			Let's test that...
			... starting with the tunnels you
			have under Farpoint, Groppler.
			Identical to the ones on that
			space vessel lifeform, over there.
			Why was it punishing you,
			Groppler?
			In return for pain you caused to
			some other creature?
			We did nothing wrong! It was
			injured, we helped it...
			Thank you, that was the missing
			part.
			Tasha, rig phasers to deliver an
			energy beam.
			Aye, sir.
			Yes, Captain, I understand now.
			It has to be conceivable that
			somewhere in the galaxy there
			could exist creatures able to
			convert energy into matter...
			And into specific patterns of
			matter. Much as our transporters
			do.
			On the viewer, Captain!
			Zorn, you captured something like
			that, didn't you?
			Warn my people, please! Leave
			Farpoint Station immediately!
			He's lied to you, Captain.
			Shouldn't you let his people die?
			Transmit the message. "Leave
			Farpoint immediately".
			Then it was a pair of creatures
			I was sensing. One down there
			in grief and pain, the other up
			here, filled with anger...
			And firing not on the new space
			station, but on the old Bandi
			city.
			Attacking those who captured
			it's...
			... it's mate?
			Energy beam ready, sir.
			Lock it in on Farpoint Station.
			I see now it was too simple a
			puzzle. But generosity has always
			been my weakness.
			Let it have whatever it can
			absorb. Energize!
			Now getting feedback on the beam,
			sir.
			Discontinue it.
			Groppler Zorn, there'll soon be
			no Farpoint Station if I'm right
			about this.
			A lucky guess!
			I know we deserve this loss, but
			please believe me, we meant not
			to harm the creature, but to use
			it.
			Sir, a feeling of great joy. And
			gratitude.
			Great joy and gratitude... from
			both of them.
			And why? Because it furnishes
			entertainment to you! You use
			other lifeforms for recreation.
			If so, you've not provided the
			best...
			Get off my ship, you smug
			hypocrite.
			Why not? We can also meet
			another time, another place.
			That's doesn't frighten us at
			all! You accuse us of "grievous
			savagery"? No, the one proven
			guilty of that crime is you!
			I trust this isn't the usual way
			our missions will go, sir.
			On no, Number One, I'm sure
			they'll be much more interesting.
