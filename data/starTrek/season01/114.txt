			Captain's log, stardate 41242.4.
			Our last assignment has taken us
			into the remote Omicron Theta
			star system, home of our android
			crewmember Lieutenant Commander
			Data. Although we are due...
			... at our next assignment, I have
			decided to increase velocity to
			warp eight to visit Data's home
			planet for a few hours in the
			hopes of unraveling some of the
			mystery of his beginnings.
			Sir, we are now twenty minutes
			from Omicron Theta...
			... mark!
			Stand by for subwarp; head for
			standard orbit of Data's planet.
			Wonder why Data hasn't come up
			here.
			He said he wanted to be alone.
			Perhaps it's a bigger moment for
			him than we thought.
			If he needs a formal invitation,
			Ensign, you do the honors.
			Yes sir!
			Walk!
			Data... !
			What are you doing?
			Sneezing.
			Have you got a... a "cold?"
			A cold what?
			It's a disease my mother says
			people used to get.
			Ah. But humans still sneeze for
			other reasons and I cannot seem
			to do it right.
			How can you be practicing sneezing
			when you're arriving for the first
			time at your home planet? Aren't
			you interested in that?
			More than interested. Fascinated.
			One might say agog. But I find
			sneezing interesting also.
			Confirming Class M reading there.
			But...
			... but the sensors aren't showing
			any life readings. Not even
			vegetation.
			Strange. The cruiser that found
			Data reported farmland here.
			Want to take her into orbit, Data?
			No thank you, sir.
			Continue on into close parking
			orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			I could say "home, sweet home,"
			sir... if I understood how the
			word sweet applies.
			It usually refers to the memories.
			But usually one's own memories,
			Captain.
			Do the memories you were given
			include "farms?"
			Affirmative, sir. Turning soil,
			seeding, harvesting... but the
			colony's principal interest was
			science.
			Data, I can't understand how you
			can hold the memories of four
			hundred eleven people. If that
			means every experience, every day
			they lived...
			It does not, unfortunately. It
			means only the knowledge they had
			accumulated. Actually, I am quite
			deficient in some basic human
			information.
			Sneezing, for example.
			"Sneezing?"
			Approaching close parking orbit,
			sir.
			Assemble your away party,
			Commander.
			This is an exciting moment for
			you, Data. I'm tempted to lead
			the away team down myself, except
			for the fact the first officer
			would object...
			How would Starfleet judge me if
			I didn't, sir? An entire Earth
			colony did disappear down there.
			You have no memory at all of what
			happened to them, Data?
			My final memory is of great
			danger, something sudden and not
			understood... then a blank as if
			the colonists were gone.
			Now in close parking orbit, sir.
			Welcome home, Mister Data.
			Recording signal now locked onto
			the Enterprise, sir.
			This looks like anything but
			farmland.
			Agreed, sir. The soil here's
			completely lifeless.
			This is the exact position listed
			in the Tripoli log.
			Do you recognize anything, Data?
			The land contours are familiar,
			sir. Topographically, this is
			the correct area.
			This once was rich farmland. I'd
			guess something like twenty to
			thirty years ago...
			I was discovered twenty-six years
			ago...
			There is still plant cellulose
			in the soil. No signs of decay.
			Also no signs of bacteria either.
			If you don't mind a wild guess,
			sir, I'd say everything on this
			planet could have been dead or
			dying at the time Data was found.
			The Tripoli log stated that all
			plant life appeared brown and
			"dormant." They assumed it was
			normal for that season.
			... whereas actually everything
			was dying...
			I was found twenty meters in that
			direction, sir.
			Data, any idea at all why you were
			given the colonists' memories?
			I have always felt that it was
			done hurriedly, but I know little
			more.
			Here, sir. This is where the
			cruiser's landing party found
			the signal device that had led
			them here.
			And they found me lying there,
			sir.
			You were just lying out in the
			open? No identity record, no
			instructions... ?
			Only a layer of dust.
			There's much more of it now, after
			twenty-six years.
			What is the first thing you
			remember, Data?
			Opening my eyes and finding myself
			looking into the eyes of the
			Tripoli landing party, sir.
			They believed that the signal
			device sensed their presence,
			and activated me.
			Then this very spot was your
			birthplace...
			But not at all like a human birth.
			Having the colonists' memories,
			I knew immediately how to speak,
			who I was, where I was...
			You were born and became fully
			knowledgeable at the same instant!
			I had no idea that was unusual,
			of course.
			It's such a strange place to be
			born.
			So was a manger.
			A "manger," sir?
			I won't even try to explain that
			one, Worf...
			I understand now, sir! I've got
			this figured!
			It was really very cleverly done
			to make this look like a natural
			hollow in the terrain here.
			Signs of it being constructed
			hurriedly...
			... as if to hide something here.
			Yes, that was it, Geordi.
			This has awakened a memory
			remnant of how the colonists
			hoped to remain hidden...
			... but their fear of being
			discovered led to their storing
			information in me.
			Yes, I thought so.
			No life readings in here either,
			sir.
			The colony laboratory, I'd guess.
			Extremely well equipped.
			Does this place stir any memories,
			Data?
			Only vague impressions of some
			of my functions being tested
			here, sir...
			Posted by a proud parent...
			This pictures something that feels
			familiar, sir. And dangerous,
			although I have no idea what it
			represents. And that is all...
			... except for an impression that
			this was a... "Doctor Soong's"
			work area.
			Who? You can't mean Doctor
			Noonien Soong?
			He was called that here...
			although, his memories indicate
			he traveled here under a different
			name.
			Doctor Noonien Soong, my friend,
			just happens to have been Earth's
			foremost robotics scientist!
			Until he tried to make Asimov's
			dream of a positronic brain come
			true.
			The positronic brain. He promised
			it would do so much. When it
			failed completely, Doctor Soong
			disappeared.
			Now we know he went off somewhere
			to try a second time.
			Geordi, Data, we'll take a close
			look at this lab.
			You and Lieutenant Worf
			reconnoiter where the rest of
			these corridors lead.
			Data... it's you.
			An epidermal mold, I'd guess.
			Made to give your exterior the
			desired finish.
			Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.
			Come in, Lieutenant.
			Sir... this installation is big
			enough to hold hundreds of people.
			But all that's here now is empty
			beds.
			Thank you, Lieutenant. Complete
			your record scans, then report
			back here.
			Sir...
			Seems to be a storage area here...
			How many more Datas are there?
			Looks like just these two...
			I mean that and the real Data.
			Commander, can this be another
			me? Or perhaps my brother?
			I honestly don't know, Data.
			He needs assembling.
			"He?" Data, we don't know that
			this could become "alive."
			It is of great interest to me to
			find out, sir. I never believed it
			possible I might have a link with
			some form like my own.
			Understood. We'll take it back
			to the ship, of course.
			Captain, I have a subspace reply
			to your request.
			Starfleet considers it vital we
			begin our ship's computer upgrade
			at Starbase Armus Nine on
			schedule.
			Damn. Can anyone see why they've
			turned down a perfectly legitimate
			request to finish this
			investigation here?
			Sir... you asked for the kind of
			computer upgrade that only the
			Bynars can handle. And they're
			available only at this time.
			Then, get us there on schedule,
			Number One.
			Thank you, Wesley. I'd completely
			forgotten that.
			Take us out of orbit, Mister La
			Forge.
			Captain's log, Stardate 41242.45.
			Despite having only a few hours
			in which to explore Data's home
			planet...
			... we have discovered something
			which may explain Data's
			beginnings... if we can properly
			assemble and communicate with what
			we've found.
			Signal from the captain. They
			need you at the debriefing.
			I've been anxious to hear the
			chief engineer's opinion, Mister
			Argyle. Do you believe he can
			be made to function?
			It appears to include all the
			components in your body. Not that
			we really understand your
			construction either...
			We'll have our top medical and
			engineering specialists working
			on its assembly, Mister Data.
			Just... one thing. Without
			disassembling you, of course, if
			we should need...
			... If we should need to compare
			this with the way... uh, with the
			way you're put together... ?
			Bringing it up here was the right
			thing to do, of course, Number
			One.
			I was just saying, Data, that if
			it functions, it might answer a
			lot of questions for us.
			Does it appear to have all
			your... ah, parts?
			Completely, sir.
			Will we know how to... to "turn
			it on?"
			All right, all right...
			Legitimate questions about this
			need not be asked apologetically.
			You're uncomfortable about aspects
			of your duplicate, Data... we're
			uncomfortable, too... and none of
			it for any logical reason. We
			know that you're as "alive" as
			any of the rest of us.
			If you find it awkward to be
			reminded that Data is a
			"machine"... you might remember
			that the rest of you are merely
			a different variety of
			machine... in our case,
			electro-chemical in nature.
			Let's begin handling this as we
			would anything else.
			Agreed! Love that captain!
			My comments, Lieutenant, do not
			require applause!
			Yes, sir; sorry, sir.
			Let's start with you, Data.
			Well... a good starting point might
			be, "Why was I given human form?"
			To make it easy for humans to
			relate to you. Had to be. But
			your designer may have had
			something else to prove also.
			That human-shaped robots need not
			be clumsy, limited things...
			You certainly operate as well as
			we do, Data...
			In some ways better, sir.
			Ah... yes! But the important
			question now may be what happened
			to the colonists.
			Agreed.
			One of several exhibited in the
			lab, by proud parents, no doubt.
			This could be simply a child's
			imagination. But then, several
			children made similar drawings.
			Doctor Crusher to Captain. At
			this point, sir, we very much need
			Mister Data's help.
			He's on his way, Doctor.
			There, Doctor. Press your fingers
			there.
			It operates somewhat like a
			"switch," Doctor.
			And these small projections?
			An android alarm clock, Doctor.
			Is that amusing?
			It times how long I remain
			unconscious.
			Are you certain about us using
			these heating devices, Data?
			I will feel nothing at all.
			Marvelous. It should all be a
			lot simpler... once we can see how
			your circuitry's connected.
			I'll mention it to no one. You
			have my word.
			If you had an off-switch
			Doctor... would you not keep it
			secret?
			I probably would.
			Yes, notice the micro-circuitry
			here... and here.
			Then another fibroid-like
			connection here.
			Let's close up.
			If I've done it right, he'll
			switch on in a minute.
			It seemed to go well...
			... thanks to a look inside Mister
			Data. But there have been no
			signs of consciousness, yet...
			Certainly a perfect match for
			Data, sir.
			Do you think so, really?
			I wonder which of them was made
			first?
			He was. But they found him
			imperfect and I was made to
			replace him.
			You may call me Lore.
			I'm also a bit troubled by it
			describing you as "imperfect."
			Human language gives me
			difficulties too, sir.
			"Imperfect" could mean I lack
			abilities that he possesses.
			I wonder. But the point of this
			is whether you and it have
			approximately the same
			capabilities.
			We do, sir, and your referring
			to him as an "it"... suggests I
			too fit into the category of a
			"thing."
			I see your point, Commander. My
			sincere apologies.
			Gladly accepted, sir. As for
			Lore's abilities, his use of
			syntax and grammar suggests he
			was given human memories similar
			to mine.
			You both have about equal
			physical strength and mental
			ability?
			I believe so, sir.
			Which requires I now ask you... a
			very serious question. Since the
			two of you are closely related
			to each other...
			The answer, sir, is that my
			loyalty is to you and Starfleet.
			Completely.
			Thank you, Commander. I was
			certain of that.
			And Helm control are here, with
			the ship's heading given in
			measurements, we call them
			"degrees"...
			... with three hundred-sixty of
			them in a full circle this way.
			... Then you say "mark"...
			On the nose!
			Which separates it from another
			three hundred-sixty degree full
			circle like this... on a right
			angle to that one.
			So by ordering a heading so many
			degrees this way, and so many this
			way, the ship can travel in any
			direction. All three dimensions.
			And the square of the hypotenuse
			of a right triangle...
			Is equal to the sum of the square
			of its other two...
			... its two "somethings"... which
			I once heard but never understood.
			All of which you can learn more
			about, when the captain has
			approved your being on the bridge.
			Have I committed an offense?
			You'll find as I have that
			starships are loaded with rules
			which have to be learned.
			You're very clever, Wesley.
			I now have duties to perform.
			Correct?
			Were you ever this anxious to
			please, Data?
			Never. I judge Lore to be
			superior in that desire as well.
			Because I was designed to be so
			human, my brother, I enjoy pleasing
			humans.
			"My brother." That has a nice
			sound, Data.
			And you consider it important to
			please humans?
			It's not important?
			There are many things of
			importance... some more so than
			others.
			My quarters.
			Is my brother that important?
			It knows you?
			It can identify any of the crew.
			Just as I can identify flattery,
			brother.
			I used it only to please you, my
			brother. Is that forbidden too?
			It is best used when it reflects
			genuine feelings.
			Then, I used it properly with you.
			Do you realize Commander Riker's
			hypotenuse question tricked you
			into showing your knowledge was
			much greater than you were
			indicating?
			He didn't seem that clever. I'll
			be more careful.
			You tend to underestimate humans,
			my brother. The way you praised
			young Wesley at the Helm, for
			example...
			A child!
			He has a child's body, but we have
			found him to be much more than that.
			Thank you for that information,
			too.
			You do care about how I perform.
			I pledge to be worthy of your
			teaching, my brother.
			How would they describe this?
			"Spartan?"
			I have no need for places to sit
			or sleep. Do you?
			Do I appear that weak?
			What information are you
			requesting?
			Everything available on a Doctor
			Noonien Soong.
			Good old "Often-Wrong Soong."
			A joke, brother. Actually, he
			was a genius by human standards.
			But had destroyed his own
			reputation by making what seemed
			wild promises about his positronic
			brain design... almost all of which
			failed.
			Promises he later proved to be
			true...
			Which made you and I possible.
			Our beloved "father."
			Will I soon have a uniform like
			that, my brother?
			If you get one the way I did,
			Lore, it means four years at the
			Academy, another three as ensign,
			ten or twelve on varied space duty
			in the lieutenant grades...
			... A system designed to compensate
			for limited human abilities.
			But you, my brother, have begun
			thinking as humans do. You and
			I are completely different from
			them. Are you truly satisfied
			with the memories and knowledge
			of just a few hundred human
			colonists? Suppose it could
			reflect thousands... or a
			million... or the knowledge of
			hundreds of millions of life forms
			of every kind?
			How?
			We will discuss it in time.
			And will we also discuss which
			of us was constructed first?
			It would be foolish to
			underestimate you, my brother.
			Yes, I lied when I said you were
			made first. With good reason.
			Doctor Soong made me perfect on
			his first attempt. But he made
			me so completely human that the
			colonists became envious of me.
			You lived with the colonists?
			Until they petitioned Soong to
			design a more comfortable, less
			perfect android. In other words,
			you, my brother.
			For example, haven't you noticed
			how easily I handle human speech?
			I use their contractions... such
			as isn't or can't. You say...
			... is not or cannot.
			I say tomato, you say tomahto;
			I say potato, you say potahto...
			A very old joke, but you also
			have trouble with their humor,
			too. Am I right?
			Quite true. I keep trying to be
			more human... and keep failing.
			Do you realize, my brother, that
			I can help you become more human?
			And... do you realize... Lore,
			that I am obligated to report all
			of this to our ship's captain?
			I assumed as much when I began
			studying you.
			May I use this to learn more of
			this vessel and its customs?
			Use it also to describe for the
			captain the time you spent with
			the colonists. Including all
			you know about what happened to
			them.
			I promise a report with great
			detail and accuracy.
			Thank you, Lore. And now, I
			have duties to perform, unless
			you need something more.
			I have more than I dreamed
			possible, my brother.
			Captain's log, stardate 41242.5.
			We now have the full story of the
			micro-engineering achievement
			which produced Data... and Lore...
			... and of the tragedy which
			deprived humanity of the
			remarkable minds behind that.
			Our first clue was a child's
			drawing which showed a great,
			complex crystal shape...
			... confirmed by Lore's report to
			be an unknown kind of creature,
			capable of stripping all life from
			an entire world... insatiably
			ravenous for the life force found
			in intelligent forms like
			us... which Lore explains it stored
			in new crystal patterns... for
			purposes which are unknown.
			But how did Data escape that
			thing? Or Lore?
			Lore had been disassembled. He
			explains it as jealousy from the
			colonists. And Data wasn't yet
			"alive" at that time.
			Which explains why Data could be
			left outside in no danger from
			the creature. Whatever happened
			to the colonists, he would be
			found by any Starfleet team that
			responded to the signal being
			transmitted.
			By which Doctor Soong left proof
			behind that his experiment did
			work.
			Captain, how believable do you
			find that crystal thing?
			Having explored so little of just
			our galaxy, I find anything
			possible.
			Data, are you expecting Lore to
			come up here? He left your
			quarters some time ago.
			To go... ?
			My Turbo-sensors say he went to
			Deck One...
			Worf?
			... where he examined some
			microminiature work tools, then
			some...
			... fine grind quadratanium... ?
			Which is used in our construction.
			That particular compound is no
			more suspicious, sir, than a human
			looking for an antiseptic or an
			ointment. Nevertheless, I should
			check it out.
			You're watching everything he
			does, Data? Is that the act of
			a brother?
			The act of a Starfleet officer
			obeying his captain, Doctor.
			Speaking strictly as security
			chief, Captain... how much can you
			trust Data now?
			I trust him completely,
			Lieutenant!
			But everyone should also realize
			you just asked a necessary and
			legitimate security question.
			Thank you for explaining that,
			sir.
			Lesson one in becoming more human,
			my brother. You must observe all
			human customs.
			Champagne?
			An ancient ritual, still practiced
			when they celebrate events of
			importance.
			My brother... I toast our
			discovery of each other. May it
			fill our lives with new meaning.
			I have some doubts about the value
			of human... customs in this...my...
			brother...
			And let us toast also...
			Brother... help me...
			... also Doctor Soong who gave me
			the full richness of human needs
			and ambitions... a perfect match
			for my mind, my body...
			And let us toast also the great
			Crystal Entity... with which I
			learned to communicate. Before
			Doctor Soong disassembled me, I
			earned its gratitude by revealing
			the way to the colonists.
			Can you image its gratitude when
			I give it the life on this
			vessel... and when my cleverness
			lets it safely feed upon crowded
			worlds in the galaxy... ?
			This is strange, sir. I show
			Mister Data transmitting on a
			subspace channel.
			He's been doing considerable
			research on Doctor Soong's
			background... but let's be sure.
			Wesley, can you look in on him
			discreetly?
			Yes sir!
			... and upon arriving here you can
			identify me as the machine named
			"Data."
			End of message.
			Come in, please.
			Glad you are here, Wesley. Lore
			suddenly attacked me and I had
			to turn him off.
			Why did he do that, Data?
			He discovered we have been
			using sensors to follow what
			he does.
			I practiced his facial "tic."
			Do I have it right?
			I'd suggest you forget imitating
			him...
			... because if you had said "We've
			been using the sensors," instead
			if "we have," I might have
			suspected you were Lore.
			Yes. I do use language more
			formally than Lore. Please
			inform the captain I will come
			up to the bridge...
			... and report on this.
			Aye, sir.
			You're certain he said he'll be
			right up?
			He indicated that, sir.
			Sensors show Data just now
			entering a turbolift, sir.
			Wes, tell me again how Data said
			he immobilized Lore.
			He said he "turned him off," Mom...
			... uh, Doctor.
			Question, Mister Data... did you
			or did you not swear me to secrecy
			about your "off switch?"
			A change of mind, Doctor. If I
			cannot trust the bridge crew, whom
			can I... ?
			Sir! I'm picking up a "bogey"
			coming in on a five o'clock
			tangent.
			Confirm! And so fast it makes
			our warp eight look like we're
			standing still!
			It's transmitting no ID signal,
			Captain...
			Set Main Viewer on that tangent.
			Shields up; go to Yellow Alert!
			Transmit friendly greetings, all
			languages, all frequencies.
			I can't believe anything
			overtaking us this fast.
			Beautiful, isn't it?
			I recognize it, Captain... it's
			similar to that child's drawing...
			My God, it's big!
			Still no ID transmitted, sir.
			Also, no answer to our inquiries.
			Did you have a direct look at it?
			It's like a snowflake crystal,
			sir. But much more complex... the
			entire electromagnetic spectrum
			seems to play about inside it...
			I haven't the slightest idea what
			it is, sir.
			Data, anything else Lore can tell
			us about it may be important.
			Can you control Lore enough to
			question him?
			I'll have to examine him to know,
			sir.
			Captain, recommend you do not
			let...
			... him move around the ship alone.
			Ensign... !
			Wesley is only trying to show
			himself alert and responsible,
			sir.
			Something to encourage. Come,
			you can watch everything I do.
			Not if I have a choice.
			That is quite enough, Ensign!
			When addressing a senior
			officer...
			I've guided his training; I'm the
			one at fault, sir.
			You will show proper courtesy,
			and I'm taking you down there to
			make certain of it!
			With your approval, of course,
			sir.
			Careful of Lore...
			Good, he is still unconscious.
			The captain refused to listen to
			you but you were right... Lore
			can be extremely dangerous.
			Notice? The same twitch, even
			when he's unconscious... I suspect
			that...
			... something went seriously wrong
			during Lore's construction.
			Stay back. We could have a
			problem if he senses someone else
			is near.
			Lore, I have some questions to
			ask you...
			Lore, it is Data. I have a few
			easy questions for you...
			He senses you!
			I'm sorry, I can't control him
			if you stay.
			Please! I'll record anything he
			says!
			And bring it to the bridge.
			Immediately!
			And you want to be as stupid as
			them... ?
			... dear brother!
			Well, Number One?
			Sir, it's Lore... with the same
			facial twitch we've all seen...
			lying unconscious exactly as Data
			described. But he became violent,
			apparently sensing that Wesley
			and I were present...
			Or is it Lore pretending to be
			Data, and faking it all?
			I asked for Commander Riker's
			report, "Acting Ensign" Crusher.
			And since it is now clear you are
			unable to function here within
			the limits of that appointment...
			Captain!
			Deflector shields holding, sir.
			Bring photon torpedoes to ready;
			main phasers to ready...
			Go to Red Alert, please.
			Weapons now ready, sir!
			No, Captain, let me talk to it...
			Why didn't you say you could?
			Affirmative! Talk to it!
			Open hailing frequencies!
			Crystal Form, I identify myself
			as "Data," advising you to stop
			your attack. The humans here are
			powerful, capable of injuring or
			even destroying you. They can
			be changed only in other ways.
			Now I call that communicating.
			But he mentioned "changing us,"
			Captain. What does that mean?
			It has many meanings, as any human
			language dictionary could inform
			you.
			Suggest moving fast to confirm
			what I told it, sir. Permission
			to use the large transporter in
			Cargo Room Three? There I can
			beam out some living pattern,
			perhaps a large tree...
			Which you'll beam over next to
			the entity...
			You are correct, Riker.
			Our ship's phasers will then blast
			and disintegrate it... proving
			we're dangerous.
			Make it so!
			Sir?
			Do it!
			Sir, I know this may finish me
			as an acting ensign, but...
			Shut up, Wesley.
			Lieutenant Yar, pick a good
			security team, let me know what
			he does.
			"Shut up, Wesley?"
			Stay out of this, Madam...
			Since I am finished here, Captain,
			may I point out... ?
			Shut up, Wesley!
			... that what I've said would have
			been listened to if it came from
			an adult officer. Request
			permission to return to my
			quarters, sir.
			Granted, if you take your mother
			with you.
			You're putting me off the bridge?
			I'm asking that you keep an eye
			on your son during this, Doctor.
			Please, Mom. Let's go.
			Emergency close!
			Now show me your warrior
			fierceness.
			I'll look, but I should never
			have let you talk me into this...
			It's Data, Mom. He's been hurt!
			It's Data! For once will you
			trust me about something?
			You must know how much Starfleet
			means to me. But I'm finished
			unless you can help me.
			I heard you know how to turn them
			on. Please?
			No, this is very serious...
			I know, Mom. So tell me again
			to "shut up, Wesley," and I will.
			You're being very unfair,
			Wesley...
			Data, the Crystal Thing is outside
			close to the ship... and Lore is
			loose somewhere inside.
			How badly are you hurt... Data?
			I will function sufficiently to
			stop Lore, Doctor...
			Whatever happens, it is important
			that you two stay away from him.
			Do not try to help me.
			Good, you understand perfectly
			so far. Next, I'll signal I'm
			about to transport something
			out...
			... at which time the deflector
			shields will turn off for a
			moment, and if you move in at
			that time...
			How sad, dear brother. You have
			made me wish I were an only child.
			Then why this marvelous gift, my
			brother? The troublesome little
			man-child.
			Are you prepared for the kind of
			death you've earned, little man?
			If you take one step toward my
			son...
			Ah, motherhood!
			Back off or I'll turn your little
			man into a torch!
			I promise him exquisite pain
			unless you obey me too, dear
			brother.
			Move away, Data, please!
			Do you see now the advantages of
			being completely human?
			It includes kindness. I give you
			your life, Doctor. Go, quickly
			and I may not injure your son at
			all.
			I will stay with Wesley, Doctor.
			Go! Or he'll be shrieking on the
			count of five. One... two...
			I'll bring help, Wesley.
			Thank you for my human quality,
			Doctor Soong.
			Now a small payment for your son's
			misdeeds.
			Mom!
			Stay back, Wesley! Help me some
			other way!
			Wesley... now!
			Lore's gone, sir, permanently!
			Now that your son's safe, Doctor,
			report immediately to Sickbay.
			Captain... The crystal thing has
			begun to move away.
			Data, get rid of that damned
			twitch! And put on a correct
			uniform.
			Yes, Captain.
			And Ensign Crusher...
			... are you able to return to duty
			now?
			Yes, sir!
			Then do so! Let the bridge know
			all is well down here.
			It's gone, sir. Without Lore, it
			had no way to reach us.
			And we're overdue for our computer
			refit.
			Number One, have you ever
			considered whether Data is more
			human, or less human than we want?
			I only wish we were as well
			balanced, sir.
			Agreed!
