			Captain's log, stardate 41235.25.
			Our location planet Ligon II,
			source of a rare vaccine needed
			on Federation planet Styris IV.
			Starfleet has instructed me...
			... to engage in a friendly visit
			and open treaty negotiations to
			acquire this medicinal substance.
			Standard orbit, sir.
			Lieutenant Yar is calling from
			Cargo Bay One, sir. Standing by
			to beam Ligonian welcoming party
			aboard.
			On our way. You have the helm,
			Mister Data.
			Cargo One.
			Should be an interesting
			experience.
			Agreed. Not only are they closely
			humanoid but their history has
			remarkable similarities to ours.
			But a highly structured society
			and they're exceedingly proud.
			They've insisted on using their
			own transporter device, sir...
			It's their way, Lieutenant. Do
			they have our coordinates?
			They have, sir. Precisely. And
			they're standing by for your
			signal.
			This is Captain Picard of the
			Starfleet vessel Enterprise.
			Please...
			... please do us the honor of
			visiting our vessel.
			Nothing concealed, sir.
			I am Lutan.
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome
			aboard. These are my officers.
			Second in command, Commander
			William Riker; Ship's Counselor
			Deanna Troi; my security officer,
			Lieutenant Tasha Yar.
			A woman? Your Chief of Security?
			Yes, Lutan: that is her expertise.
			I am honored to meet your
			officers.
			And this is my Secondary, Hagon.
			A sample of the vaccine.
			My duty, Lutan.
			Sorry, I am required to inspect...
			Aside, little one...
			This... this is a woman?
			How interesting!
			May we prove as surprising to you.
			If I may suggest, sir...
			No apology. In their view, it
			would weaken us.
			Nothing concealed, Captain.
			Do you care to accept it?
			Yes, yes, please do.
			Unless you care to examine it
			further.
			Absolutely not. This vaccine
			sample is a gift of life and we
			are honored at receiving it.
			Will you do us the honor of
			letting us entertain you now?
			You may prepare it. We will join
			you shortly.
			I ask forgiveness....
			They are strange alien things.
			You bear no fault...
			But the female...
			May be exactly what I've needed.
			Lutan, we're aware of many of your
			planet's achievements, and its
			unique similarity to an ancient
			Earth culture, which we all
			admire. On behalf of the
			Federation, therefore, I am proud
			to present to you this token of
			gratitude and friendship. From
			China's Sung Dynasty, Fourteenth
			Century.
			Thirteenth Century, sir.
			Indeed?
			It is a most thoughtful gift.
			We are grateful.
			We from Ligon have always been
			apprehensive about strangers.
			We are not as technologically
			advanced as you; yet we possess
			something you do not -- a vaccine
			which has been found to be an
			effective antidote to your deadly
			Anchilles fever. If your conduct
			toward us is worthy -- if you
			respect our customs -- and if we
			see this respect -- we will
			become friends. Then, we will
			make the vaccine available to all
			who need it.
			If you require respect from us,
			I'm certain you will see it.
			Surrounded by such friendship,
			I have no need of my guards.
			I will return shortly. Prepare
			to transport me then.
			If there is something else, any
			final courtesy...
			Is it possible to see one of your
			wondrous holodecks? We have heard
			how they are used to train your
			officers.
			And used for many other things
			too.
			Commander Riker, perhaps you and
			Counselor Troi can demonstrate.
			Is it possible for Lieutenant Yar
			to do so Captain? Some
			demonstration of defense training?
			We've noticed you are intrigued
			by her having security
			responsibilities. But such things
			are not at all unusual with us.
			With us, it is the duty of women
			only to own the land, and the duty
			of men to protect and rule it.
			Much the same has happened in
			human history too.
			I'd like to do it, sir.
			As a sign of respect, perhaps.
			Very well.
			This way, please.
			Aikido. One.
			It won't move until my actions
			activate it.
			You can create people? Without
			a soul?
			It's not a real person, Lutan.
			It has no life. Everything it
			does is controlled by computer.
			Who am I? Do you hear me?
			But it will feel real when it hits
			you.
			A force like that cannot possibly
			come from an image, Lutan.
			Then you will show me, Hagon.
			Oh. . . . Oh...
			Thank you, Lieutenant. How very
			enlightening.
			Aikido, vanish.
			I could create two -- even three,
			but one is really enough. As you
			fight with it, it learns, and
			before long it knows exactly how
			to defeat you.
			Even the extraordinary Lieutenant
			Yar?
			It forces us to keep improving.
			Your skill impresses me. I like
			you.
			Farewell, my new friends of the
			noble Enterprise.
			Understanding has made friends
			of many different people. We've
			had a good beginning, Lutan.
			May I also extend a personal
			farewell to Lieutenant Yar?
			In your Federation terms.
			Picard to bridge. Red alert!
			Shields up; activate photon
			torpedoes!
			What com contact have we had with
			them?
			With their orbital control
			station, sir.
			Make contact there and on all
			hailing frequencies.
			Enterprise to Lutan and Ligonian
			government. You have committed
			an unfriendly act. You will reply
			immediately.
			Photon torpedoes ready, Captain.
			Set for a display blast, a
			thousand meters short of planet
			surface. Fire!
			Display blast away!
			Do we know the source of their
			transporter beam?
			Our own transporter people tried
			to trace it, sir, but without
			effect.
			It reads similar to Starfleet's
			early efforts but uses the
			Heglenian shift to convert matter
			and energy in different...
			... which is actually not
			important at this time.
			This is Captain Picard of the
			Enterprise with a message to Lutan
			whom I have so far acknowledged
			as a friend. But you have now
			committed what our laws regard
			as an attack upon us, Lutan. And
			having visited us here, Lutan,
			you must certainly understand the
			power of our vessel. We have so
			far fired only a warning burst
			at you. We insist you reply to
			this message.
			Opinion, Counselor. Will they
			injure Tasha?
			I believe not, sir. In fact, they
			seem mainly curious. But in the
			case of Lutan I did feel other
			needs.
			What kind of needs?
			Some sexual attraction from all
			the males. Lieutenant Yar is
			physically very attractive. But
			I felt something else in the case
			of Lutan... something more like...
			avarice or ambition.
			Other comments?
			If I may, sir... one of the things
			about them in the briefing studies
			was their respect for patience.
			Strongly emphasized. And you can
			see it in the precise, ritualistic
			way they do things. I'm worried
			about Lieutenant Yar too, sir,
			but maybe we should sit and wait
			them out.
			Analysis, the two of you.
			Everything we know about them and
			how these happenings fit into
			that.
			Stardate 41235.32. I am
			concerned. Over a full day of
			waiting with no response from...
			... Lutan. We are now testing
			whether they are aware of our
			sensors probing them. So far,
			we believe we have pinpointed
			Lutan's government compound.
			The vaccine, sir...
			Yes, Doctor?
			The vaccine...
			I'm a... physician; I've seen death.
			But not on the scale this could
			mean.
			Meanwhile, you were testing
			whether we can replicate the
			vaccine...
			And we can't! Their sample
			works fine when used as an
			injection, but it becomes unstable
			when we try to replicate it. You
			must get vaccine from the planet,
			Captain. As much as you can.
			Immediately!
			I'm aware of that, Doctor.
			You've never had to watch a
			patient die from this disease.
			That's true. But I've seen my
			share of death.
			Damn!
			Where are the calluses we doctors
			are supposed to grow over our
			feelings?
			Perhaps the good ones never get
			them.
			Yes, Doctor?
			May I speak about my son Wesley?
			What?
			Well, yes. Yes, of course.
			He's so interested in starship
			operations. And...
			... speaking as a mother, of
			course, he seems quite
			knowledgeable.
			Well, yes... speaking as a
			mother...
			He's on the turbolift. You'll
			remember you ordered him to stay
			off the bridge.
			I haven't stepped one foot on your
			bridge, Captain...
			It's all right, sir, I'll see he
			leaves immediately...
			No.
			No?
			Why don't you sit at Ops? Next
			to Lieutenant La Forge.
			Sir?
			Sir?
			Is the whole ship deaf?!
			Sit down over there, young man!
			Temporarily.
			Captain, we have more information
			from the briefing studies on
			Ligon...
			Excuse me.
			Doctor Crusher, some of this may
			interest you.
			Proceed with your analysis.
			It is a highly structured society
			in which people live by strict
			codes of honor. For example, what
			Lutan has done is similar to what
			certain American Indians once did,
			called "counting coup." That's
			from an obscure language called
			French --
			A language which for centuries
			on Earth represented civilization,
			Mister Data.
			Indeed?
			I suggest you drop it, Mister
			Data.
			Yes sir. Counting coup could be
			as simple as touching an enemy
			with a stick in battle, or taking
			something from him and escaping.
			It was considered extremely
			heroic.
			And under these circumstances
			Lutan considers himself heroic,
			risking literally everything in
			the face of our superior power.
			And it fits Lutan's personality
			profile as well. He has an
			abnormally high need for
			achievement -- I've sensed it in
			him, very strongly.
			We should establish clearly also,
			that Lutan is dangerous. Self
			image for him is a function of
			how much he THINKS he's achieved.
			Those who set their standards too
			high can kill to meet them.
			Why Tasha?
			As a Starfleet security officer,
			she may have represented his
			riskiest prize.
			Transmission from the planet
			surface, sir... Main viewer on.
			Yes, Lutan? What do you wish?
			You will display your image,
			please.
			What is required is an image of
			Lieutenant Yar, well and...
			Are you making demands, Captain?
			Sir...
			According to the Ligon Code of
			Honor, Lutan has done what he set
			out to do -- achieve recognition
			for being daring and bold.
			We've studied this in some depth
			now, sir. The proper thing for
			you to do now is to ask to get
			Tasha back.
			Ask for her?
			Politely, Captain.
			And now, Lutan...
			You have boldly taken the
			lieutenant from us and I ask that
			you... now please return her.
			Then come visit us, Captain, and
			we will return her to you.
			First Officer to Transporter
			Chief...
			Forgive me but can you delay
			calling him?
			Please. We must discuss the away
			party.
			Am I included?
			It concerns you directly, Captain.
			Wesley. It's time we left.
			Wesley... thanks for taking a turn
			at the controls.
			Yes sir.
			Commander....
			"Commander?" That's quite
			formal...
			So is this request, sir. We
			believe it would be preferable
			if the captain led this away
			party.
			Agreed, sir. Their customs
			concerning guests make it much
			preferable.
			And I'm very much against it.
			Lutan is clearly a liar, and
			devious. Counselor Troi has
			admitted she believes him capable
			of killing. It is my duty to keep
			the captain out of danger, sir.
			Except that Ligonian custom makes
			it clear that a visiting leader
			becomes an honored guest.
			Not us, not second in command...
			him.
			And the custom requires Lutan to
			die rather than violate that.
			Yes... it does sound reasonable
			put that way.
			I warn you, Captain... if you get
			hurt, I'll put you on report!
			Welcome to my Centerplace, Captain
			Picard. Consider yourselves my
			honored guests.
			Every hospitality will be accorded
			you.
			This is my First One, Yareena.
			Lutan is a fortunate man.
			You've met Counselor Troi.
			Yes.
			As on your vessel, you have only
			to name whatever courtesy we can
			provide.
			Then, sir... the courtesy of
			seeing Lieutenant Yar.
			Lieutenant Yar will be returned
			to you tonight at a banquet I have
			arranged in your honor.
			I would like to see her now.
			Bring Lieutenant Yar.
			I find it odd, Captain, that a
			man of your experience has such
			difficulty in understanding
			ordinary politeness.
			Such as saying "please" when
			abducting someone?
			The expression "please" is used
			only when requesting the person
			back.
			Yours is a different world.
			With clear and simple ways deeply
			rooted in our culture. If you
			are willing to ask for Lieutenant
			Yar's release tonight in front
			of all, honor will be satisfied.
			One can see the importance of
			"honor" here.
			Honor is everything.
			There will be gifts for each of
			you, to absolve the abduction.
			Lieutenant, have you been treated
			well?
			Fine, Captain...
			... but they're showing some signs
			of wear.
			There isn't any need to be
			concerned, Captain. She's being
			well cared for.
			My ship's company and I are
			certain of your gentle wisdom in
			that.
			I thought for a moment I heard
			a threat implied.
			But that would be foolishness.
			Something to be carefully avoided
			I agree.
			The festivities for her return
			to you are in preparation. Shall
			we retire until then?
			Until tonight, Lutan.
			We present you gifts!
			Lutan, you have granted us
			hospitality and the safety of your
			Centerplace. The gifts you give
			us are rare and precious. We
			thank you. In accordance with
			the customs of your ancestors,
			which I honor and respect, I am
			here in peace to ask for the
			return of Lieutenant Yar.
			Well spoken. There are some among
			my equals in this gathering who
			were wary of my approaching the
			Federation. I am proud to have
			taken this first step towards a
			treaty -- and proud we have
			something of great value to offer
			you -- a priceless life-giving
			vaccine.
			The abduction I have done
			according to our custom, for all
			to see.
			Your conduct in this matter has
			been beyond exemplary, Captain
			Picard --
			-- but now that the moment has
			come, I find I cannot part with
			her.
			You speak of a code of honor...
			but what you are now saying is
			called under our customs... an
			act of war.
			No, no, Captain! You do not
			understand.
			Correct! I am now beyond
			understanding!
			This is not an act of war, but
			of love. I want Lieutenant Yar
			to become my First One.
			I challenge your right of
			supercedence!
			No woman has challenged
			supercedence for over two-hundred
			years!
			The right is mine -- and I will
			have it!
			Natasha Yar -- I challenge you!
			A struggle to the death!
			NO! The challenge is
			unequivocally refused!
			Then you shall have no treaty --
			no vaccine -- and no Lieutenant
			Yar!
			Ship's log, First Officer Riker
			reporting. We have been informed
			of the challenge to Lieutenant
			Yar...
			... and are maintaining combat
			readiness round-the-clock. We
			are probing Lutan's compound
			deeply with our sensors now, still
			unnoticed.
			Captain. Deanna.
			Did you have any idea, Lieutenant,
			that Lutan would suddenly announce
			he wanted you for his First One?
			What do you know of this?
			Nothing, sir.
			But it was a thrill. Lutan is
			such... such a basic male image
			and having him say he wants you...
			Yes, of course it made me feel
			good...
			Troi! I'm your friend and you
			tricked me!
			Only so you'll think about it
			completely and clearly.
			We're all being manipulated,
			Lieutenant, and most of all
			myself.
			How simple all this would be
			without the Prime Directive.
			That thought has passed thorugh
			my mind, Counselor.
			What's this message from Starbase
			Fourteen?
			It's showing infection rates,
			percentage illness increases...
			The plague on Styris IV has
			flared up out of control.
			Oh, no!
			They're estimating deaths in the
			millions, sir.
			Captain Picard, come in.
			I know I could win. Not that I'd
			take her life, of course, but I'd
			be glad to embarrass her. The
			idea of accusing me...
			The plague?
			If anything, worse than we heard.
			Which means they desperately need
			the vaccine, sir. And I know
			I can win this challenge...
			You do not have to prove anything
			here, Lieutenant.
			But the vaccine is important in
			this case, sir... ?
			Counselor, I would consider you
			the last person to argue for
			Lieutenant Yar to accept that
			challenge.
			Betazoid blood is also practical,
			Captain.
			The odds are very good she'd
			defeat Lutan's wife easily and
			you would win all the bargaining
			points you need.
			"The odds are... ?"
			As you have pointed out yourself,
			we are all at risk every day of
			every mission.
			I'll want some explanations from
			Lutan.
			But why not let him volunteer
			them, Captain? His needs for
			approval are immense. I'm sure
			if you found something you liked
			about him, he'd be anxious to
			agree with it.
			Yes, he would indeed. He's almost
			crippled with needs, the poor
			handsome dear.
			I should tell you I do admire the
			hospitality you offer here, Lutan.
			A pity you began by abducting my
			security officer.
			I am in the grip of forces you
			do not understand.
			Some of it I do understand. She
			is a rather lovely female...
			You surprise me, Captain. What
			do you know of needs and feelings?
			Nothing.
			Well, almost nothing in my
			position of ship's captain.
			Aha, I see.
			But it puzzles me; if you feel that
			way about Tasha, why have you
			challenged her to a fight to the
			death?
			Not I, Yareena! I am merely a
			spectator.
			But you are also a man of great
			importance and wealth.
			Great importance, perhaps...
			Aha, I see. Then you too
			understand the proper value of
			women?
			We understand they are highly
			pleasant things... but after all,
			unimportant, except for the land
			they own.
			You're a truly clever person,
			Lutan. You have nothing to lose
			either way the challenge goes.
			A code of honor, Captain, protects
			one like a magic cloak.
			I will order Lieutenant Yar to
			fight.
			And may your cloak bring you all
			you deserve, Lutan.
			Come in.
			Why that razor, my friend? Why
			not the one I adjusted into
			perfect efficiency?
			Shaving is a human art form, Data.
			Technological perfection can shave
			too close.
			Puzzling. How can anything be
			too efficient?
			Tens of thousands of things. Maybe
			hundreds.
			We always go back to the human
			equation.
			Exactly. Have you kept working
			on it?
			Constantly, my friend.
			Particularly human humor. For
			example, a man goes to a store
			to buy some kidneys. He says to
			the shopkeeper, "I'd like a pound
			of kiddillies, please." The
			shopkeeper says to him, "You mean
			kidneys, don't you?" The man
			says, "I said kiddillies, diddle
			I?"
			It's too old. And you didn't tell
			it very well.
			... How do you know when
			something's funny?
			It's not explainable. You just
			do.
			Perhaps it is you, Geordi.
			Includling the kiddillies, I've
			learned six hundred sixty-two
			jokes, and you haven't...
			"Includling the kiddillies!" Now
			that's funny.
			It was not meant as a joke!
			The tongue slipped!
			Riker to Commander Data,
			Lieutenant La Forge. Report to
			the Transporter Room for away
			party duty.
			First officer to captain. Ready
			with the away personnel.
			Lock in on this location.
			Transporter locked in, sir.
			Energize!
			You've both seen the message about
			the plague?
			And how badly the vaccine is
			needed. Yes sir.
			We need to know as much as
			possible about Ligonian arms and
			armaments. Data, especially
			important will be an analysis of
			their combat capabilities.
			Geordi, concentrate on their
			cutting edges where applicable,
			durability, composition,
			weaknesses of material.
			Aye, sir.
			From any particular point of view,
			sir?
			From the perspective of Lieutenant
			Yar's using them in combat with
			Lutan's wife.
			Are you...
			You, you're serious, I can see
			that.
			Most interesting.
			Could this be human joke number
			six hundred sixty-three?
			Negative, Data! It's a captain's
			order!
			Which makes it important to
			know...
			... which of these weapons are to
			be used.
			That fact isn't known until the
			combat begins.
			You're right, Data. It does sound
			like a joke. With the power of
			the Enterprise, we could overwhelm
			this place easily. Take what we
			want.
			I may not understand human humor,
			sir, but I am a Starfleet Academy
			graduate.
			Which means, of course...
			... understanding the Prime
			Directive, sir.
			Which is, unfortunately, what this
			is about. By our standards, the
			customs here and code of honor
			are the same kind of pompous,
			strutting charades that endangered
			our own species a few centuries
			ago. We evolved out of it because
			no one else imposed their own...
			Sorry, that became a speech.
			You're the captain, sir. You're
			entitled...
			I am not entitled to bore you with
			what you already know. Carry on!
			Ship's log, Commander William
			Riker reporting. Stardate
			41235.4.
			Continuing our appraisal of
			Ligonian technology. The Captain
			has made it clear...
			... he wants Lieutenant Yar beamed
			immediately to safety if her life
			should become endangered... and
			I fervently hope the rules of that
			contest make it possible.
			Riker to Transporter Room. Do you
			have our people on the sensors yet?
			Their general area, sir. Visual on
			screen now.
			As you see, we're still doing some
			fine tuning.
			I agreed to this meeting, but I
			see no point to it. You have
			accepted the challenge; there is
			nothing further to say.
			I think you should know that there
			is no physical training anywhere
			that matches Starfleet, especially
			its security people.
			And you should know that even
			though these contests are rare,
			we have a tradition of making
			ourselves capable of them.
			Yareena, my acceptance had nothing
			to do with Lutan.
			It has everything to do with
			Lutan. Lutan wants you to be his
			First One.
			Impossible, Yareena. I am a career
			Starfleet officer...
			How could you not love him? Every
			woman loves him!
			Yareena, I fight for the
			vaccine... That's the truth.
			The truth is I will kill you if
			I can. And believe me, I can.
			There is nothing else to say.
			In my world it's a greater honor
			to refuse to ...
			You are on our world!
			Captain, I'm your counselor. You
			brought me with you to Ligon to
			be of help.
			Then help me, please. What is
			a way out of this?
			With the vaccine?
			None. Not under the rules we
			believe in.
			The weapons in that room are
			surprisingly durable and
			flexible... and deadly.
			And light, as if they're made for
			women to use.
			Some of them still have traces
			of blood -- and poison.
			Poison?
			Alkaloid base. Deadly.
			But we found no indication it is
			invariably used, sir. Or ever,
			in contests like this.
			A theory, Data. What would be
			the best defense against weapons
			like these?
			Undiminished attack because of
			the possibility of poison, sir.
			What about those lengths of metal
			in the yard outside?
			Uncertain, sir. However, joined
			together they would make a
			rectangle or square enclosing one
			hundred twenty-one square meters.
			If put end-to-end vertically,
			they would make a pole forty-four
			meters high, or two of twenty-two
			meters, or...
			Thank you, Data.
			You are welcome, sir.
			She won't budge. She loves him
			-- without reservation.
			And she thinks I love him too.
			Most interesting. Do you?
			Of course I don't, Data! As Troi
			pointed out to me, I'm attracted
			to him but that is entirely
			different.
			How so?
			I'll agree it is puzzling, Data,
			but since it involves Tasha's very
			intimate and personal...
			It involves nothing I'm ashamed
			of!
			In fact, you may discover that
			the very worst move of your life
			was when you threw in with flesh
			and blood humans.
			But certainly the most
			interesting.
			Interesting? Data, I grew up on
			a failed colony, completely
			lawless, mad, where people took
			what they wanted. This meant
			males for the reason they're
			bigger, stronger...
			And that's why I chose Starfleet
			security, I guess.
			For reasons you should be very
			proud of.
			Those were my early interests...
			strength, daring, dominant
			males... and that's why Lutan
			attracts me. To me, he's like
			a Federation Olympic Games hero.
			But do I want to become his
			so-called "First One," marry him?
			That would be nonsense!
			Most interesting.
			Ah! You feel that also!
			And having laid all that out,
			Lieut...
			Tasha... we come to a most serious
			question...
			Riker to captain.
			Go ahead. We're alone.
			We're fine tuned enough to see
			your hosts gathering in the open
			area outside with a number of them
			now headed for your location.
			Thank you, Number One.
			I was about to ask if considering
			that background, your apprehension
			by Lutan, all of that... do you
			still feel ready to undergo this
			challenge? Do you judge your
			condition good?
			I judge it excellent, sir.
			Your weapons, Lieutenant Yar.
			You may pick your size.
			Don't touch the spines! They're
			poisoned.
			If you're not careful you could
			kill yourself.
			These I understand.
			First Officer's log, supplemental.
			Captain Picard, faced with a
			critical need for a vaccine
			produced on this planet...
			... has permitted Lieutenant
			Natasha Yar to engage in a fight
			to the death. I have yet to
			understand his reasoning or his
			plan.
			Care to lend a hand?
			Yes sir!
			Was I seen leaving?
			They've got eyes only for the
			program.
			Captain Picard wanted no risk of
			our communications being
			overheard. You're to proceed now,
			as he indicated.
			Captain's orders here, too.
			Does the Captain understand what
			you and Geordi reported about
			those weapons? They're razor
			sharp, split-second lethal...
			I am here to brief you on what he
			plans.
			Any last minute instructions, sir?
			Stay alive. We'll hope to do the
			rest.
			I speak for Lutan. The rules are
			known; let combat continue until
			there is a victor. It will not
			be interrupted.
			Proceed.
			Combatants, hold your positions!
			Return the weapon!
			Yareena! Careful!
			Move!
			We're too late; she's growing
			cold.
			Sorry that clashes with my
			instructions...
			On no, no...
			Exactly what do you find unfair,
			Lutan? They fought to the death;
			you saw the final blow; you know
			the effects of your poison...
			But what of your Lieutenant Yar?
			She is to become my First One now.
			I certainly won't stop her -- if
			she cares to claim that honor.
			But remember, you now have all
			Yareena's lands and wealth, Lutan.
			At least, all has not been lost.
			Picard here.
			Since you've fulfilled your
			agreement, Captain, can we now
			beam the vaccine aboard?
			Ah, yes... of course.
			No problem, Number One. Send down
			someone from medical.
			And to complete our business here,
			we are locked onto you.
			Five to beam up. Energize.
			First Officer's log, Stardate
			41235.6. I am returning the conn
			to Captain Picard...
			... as we begin loading the vaccine
			supply aboard. Shortly, we hope
			to signal "mission complete."
			Welcome back, Captain, and you're
			wanted in the lounge.
			This way, gentlemen.
			She is not dead! There was no
			death combat; you have violated
			our agreement. There will be no
			treaty, no vaccine... !
			The challenge was carried out.
			She died, Lutan.
			There was no challenge! She is
			alive.
			I am a physician and saw her die.
			If you doubt this poison, why not
			test it on yourself?
			Lutan, we can provide you with
			the medical records to prove her
			death and how Doctor Crusher
			brought her back.
			And at the instant of death,
			Lutan, a mating agreement
			dissolves.
			But this is witchcraft, Yareena.
			To discard a mate in that
			manner...
			... is less painful than the one
			you selected for me.
			No, Yareena...
			Even as I battled, Hagon, I heard
			you calling out for me.
			Be my First One, Yareena.
			All my land, all my goods, all
			I have... is yours to rule.
			That's so beautiful.
			And so sad for you. You've lost
			everything.
			I have my honor.
			It's such a... a waste!
			Do you want him?
			No, there would be...
			complications.
			Then I will have you as my Number
			Two.
			Take your place accordingly.
			As you see, Captain, you may excel
			in technology... but not in
			civilized behavior.
			What the... !
			Ah yes, Wesley.
			Wesley!
			He'd been manning that station
			for me. I forgot.
			Well!
			Thank you again for manning one
			of our bridge stations. We'll
			see you get another chance.
			Yes sir!
			What's the delay, Number One?
			Why aren't we warping out of here?
			Set course for Styris IV, Warp
			three.
			Course laid in for Styris IV, sir.
			Engage!
