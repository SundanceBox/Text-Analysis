			Captain's log, stardate 41723.9.
			In response to a Starfleet order
			we are in the Xendi Sabu star
			system having rendezvoused with
			a Ferengi vessel which has
			requested a meeting. Although...
			... we arrived here and made
			appropriate signals to the Ferengi
			three days ago, they have so far
			responded only with the message:
			"Stand by, Enterprise."
			Come!
			You called for me?
			Yes, Doctor. I've been feeling...
			odd, lately. Fatigued. And now
			I've got a headache.
			A what?
			Certainly you know what a
			"headache" is, Doctor.
			Of course. But I don't often
			encounter one.
			The reason for it seems fairly
			obvious. What are these Ferengi
			up to? "Stand by, Enterprise."
			Stand by for what?
			I can't find a thing wrong.
			I can't either. But they could
			be baiting some kind of trap...
			With your head. I see nothing
			physically wrong, but I want to
			run additional scans in Sickbay.
			Doctor, all I've got is...
			... is an order to report to
			Sickbay.
			From the one person aboard who can
			give you an order.
			Captain from first officer.
			They're finally sending a message.
			On my way, Number One.
			Sorry, Doctor. Duty calls.
			They're prepared to talk, sir.
			Have they given any hint what
			they've been waiting for?
			Negative on that, Captain. But
			they have identified their Captain
			as "Bok," DaiMon Bok.
			If it's Bok I'm sensing, he seems
			anxious to meet you, sir.
			Me? Why me? I've never heard
			of him.
			You'll be able to see him now,
			sir. They're willing to
			communicate on visual.
			A reminder of something we learned
			the only other time we dealt with
			Ferengi, sir -- their hearing is
			very sensitive.
			Yes, they could pick up even a
			whisper being transmitted.
			Consider ourselves reminded.
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Ferengi vessel! This is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
			We are transmitting visually.
			Is this THE Captain Picard?
			Do we know each other?
			I know you, Picard.
			I'm afraid you have the advantage.
			Is this... Bok?
			I am Bok, DaiMon of the Ferengi.
			I have asked you here to discuss
			a mutual problem, Captain.
			What problem is that, DaiMon Bok?
			I insist on speaking of that
			matter in person. Shall we meet
			on your vessel or mine?
			Hailing frequencies closed.
			Captain, I sense considerable
			deception on Bok's part. And
			danger!
			Then definitely, sir, you should
			meet with him here. Keep him
			under our control.
			Now open, sir.
			I appreciate your offer, DaiMon
			Bok, and ask you to be our guests.
			As you wish, Picard. Perhaps this
			will begin a new era of
			cooperation for both our peoples.
			In one Earth hour, then?
			One hour, Bok. End transmission.
			I can't believe they're coming
			here!
			They agreed a bit too easily.
			Then, in one hour we'll know why.
			Are you accustomed to always
			getting your way, Doctor?
			When my way makes sense, Captain.
			There are still forty minutes
			before the Ferengi beam over; I'll
			have these scans done in ten.
			A lot of effort for something as
			simple as a headache.
			"As simple?" It is my job to know
			your condition intimately. You
			should not have a headache unless
			something is wrong.
			It may be true that headaches were
			once quite common... but this was
			in the days before the brain was
			charted...
			... before we understood the nature
			of pain... when we were suffering
			from such things as the common
			cold.
			And so why do I have a headache,
			Doctor?
			I haven't the slightest damned
			idea!
			What's that?
			Something doctors use when they
			feel foolish over being proven
			wrong.
			Feel better?
			The pain's gone.
			Medical fakery -- the pain's
			actually still there, just
			cloaked. I'll want further exams
			when this Ferengi matter is
			settled.
			Sir! You'll soon be getting an
			intruder alert!
			What? Wesley, if you've something
			to report...
			If you'll scan heading four-four
			mark one-six-three, Lieutenant,
			you'll find...
			Intruder alert, sir...
			I've got something, sir... very
			distant.
			It's an old style starship,
			Constitution Class, heading this
			way under impulse power, sir.
			Says who?
			Carry on.
			Answer the first officer's
			question.
			Uh... says the long distance
			sensors, sir. I was in
			Engineering, playing around with
			boosting sensor output...
			Very interesting. Boosting it
			how?
			We will discuss it later.
			I read it now, sir, as... a
			Constitution Class starship...
			coming this way under impulse
			power.
			Sir? What's wrong?
			Nothing, just... a mild headache.
			The correct procedure, Ensign,
			would have been to signal your
			finding to the bridge immediately.
			Yes, sir.
			Bringing it here personally...
			... perhaps with the idea of being
			on hand for the Ferengi beam
			over... might have imperiled our
			ship had something hostile been
			approaching.
			Yes, sir.
			We are receiving no signal at all
			from the approaching starship,
			sir.
			Time, sir.
			Time? Oh, for the Ferengi to beam
			over.
			Do you see any problems connected
			with this old starship coming in?
			Suggest we'll be safer, sir, with
			the Ferengi over here whatever
			is happening.
			Concur.
			Stand by!
			Let's bring them on visually.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Enterprise to Ferengi vessel.
			We are standing by to receive you.
			Ready to transfer ourselves over,
			my dear Captain Picard.
			Question... where shall we receive
			you?
			On your own bridge, of course.
			Ferengi efficiency!
			Data? What do you read?
			Nothing, sir.
			It could take a few moments,
			Captain. If they build up their
			beaming energy through capacitors
			as seems likely...
			We welcome you in peace to the
			Enterprise, DaiMon Bok.
			It is our pleasure, Captain
			Picard. Might I introduce my
			first officer, Kazago, and my
			second, Rata?
			This is my first officer,
			Commander Riker...
			And Counselor Troi. Second
			Officer Data; Lieutenant La Forge;
			security officers, Lieutenant Yar
			and Lieutenant Worf; Ensign
			Crusher.
			Yes, we have heard you use
			females...
			Clothed females. Most
			interesting.
			They are that, sir.
			And the android was mentioned too.
			What is its price? We should like
			to purchase it.
			It... he is not for sale.
			Commander Data is...is...
			You wouldn't want him, Kazago.
			He's second-hand merchandise.
			Second-hand, sir?
			Oh, of course! A human joke...
			Excuse, Captain, but the
			unidentified starship is
			continuing in, still no signal
			at all...
			Think nothing of it.. It is under
			our control.
			One of our starships under your
			control?
			Do not be alarmed. It is a gift
			from us.
			With which we honor the "Hero of
			Maxia."
			Who?
			Why you, Picard, of course! Don't
			you remember the Battle of Maxia?
			I'm sorry, I'm afraid I do not.
			Data?
			Captain, he may refer to an
			incident which occurred seven
			years ago in the Maxia Zeta star
			system, where an unidentified
			starship...
			Unidentified?! That fine vessel
			was Ferengi!
			Which you destroyed, sir.
			My sincere regrets, Bok, but that
			ship did not identify itself.
			It simply attacked; we defended
			ourselves...
			Such mistakes happen in space.
			Hardly a "mistake," sir. Your
			report showed it deliberately
			attacked...
			Do you want the arriving vessel
			on Main Viewer, sir? It is only
			a thousand kilometers away now...
			Put it on your viewer.
			Main Viewer.
			We have set its controls to
			automatically take station in
			space next to your Enterprise.
			There is no one aboard it.
			When, with your permission, its
			log will be downloaded into this
			ship's records.
			At a price...
			No price!
			No price?
			For what purpose? What is this
			all...
			I felt something too, Captain.
			What is it?
			Sir... ?
			Perhaps it is... his conscience?
			Why do you say that?!
			Bridge to Sickbay...
			No... no, I'm fine...
			It seemed as if... as if it were...
			something from your past?
			I'm all right now; I'm fine.
			What is this all about?
			It is about the battle I
			mentioned, Captain. A gift in
			honor of that occasion. Look at
			that ship closely.
			Enlarge please, La Forge.
			It... it is the Stargazer. My old
			ship, but how... where did you find
			it?
			It was a derelict, adrift in space
			on the far side of this star
			system. How it got there...
			... is none of my business,
			Captain. But now that vessel is
			yours, if you wish to have it.
			We are not selling it to him?
			Call it an act of friendship.
			At no cost!? Ugly. Very ugly!
			Captain's log, stardate 41724.1.
			Bok and his officers have returned
			to their vessel, inviting us now
			to officially take possession of
			the Stargazer. They will stand
			by while completing the
			downloading of its log to us.
			Like before?
			Perhaps... it hit with more impact.
			"Hit?"
			Sorry, but anything could be
			important.
			You say you "felt" something
			yourself?
			I... believe so. Like... well, a
			thought...
			But rather... "mechanical" in
			nature.
			Are you sure it wasn't one of my
			thoughts? At that moment, I was
			remembering being at the helm of
			the Stargazer, a maneuver being
			made. We were hit...
			Something's burning... I smell
			smoke!
			Don't you smell it?
			There's nothing burning, Jean-Luc.
			Ah... no, of course. It was... the
			memory I was calling up.
			Sorry.
			Memory or... "nightmare?"
			Well, it was strong, whatever it
			was.
			Ready, Number One.
			Staff's waiting if Doctor Crusher
			approves.
			I'll do better than that -- I'll
			go along.
			But if they don't know what the
			Ferengi are up to, what good is
			it to sit there guessing?
			Well... sometimes it determines
			exactly what you don't know.
			Dead on target, my friend. Would
			you like to go up and listen to
			them?
			Some day. Right now I'm happy to
			be here.
			We were traveling at warp two
			through the Maxia Zeta star system
			when an unidentified starship
			suddenly appeared and fired on
			us! From close range.
			Where did it come from?
			It must've been lying in a deep
			moon crater nearby. The first
			attack damaged our shields, and
			in the confusion it hit us a
			second time.
			No clue who they were?
			No name, no reason...
			Can you identify them, Vigo? Our
			shields are failing; if they come
			in again... ?
			Sir? Who's Vigo?
			Ah... my weapons officer on the
			Stargazer.
			I was getting caught up in this.
			Then, with your shields failing,
			sir...
			I improvised. With the other ship
			coming in for the kill...
			... I ordered a sensor bearing,
			and when it went into its return
			arc...
			... you performed what Starfleet
			textbooks now call "The Picard
			Maneuver."
			What any good helmsman could have
			done. I dropped into high warp...
			... then stopped right off the
			target vessel's bow...
			... and fired everything I had.
			By blowing into warp speed, you
			appeared for an instant to be in
			two places at once...
			And our attacker fired on the
			wrong one.
			As you say, "what any good
			helmsman could have done."
			But you did it first...
			A "save our skins" maneuver. The
			Stargazer was on fire, finished.
			We had to abandon ship, and limp
			through space in shuttlecraft for
			weeks before being picked up.
			I haven't thought about it in
			years...
			The Ferengi are standing by for
			us to take possession of the
			Stargazer, sir.
			I want to go over to her.
			I understand, sir.
			Once my people make certain she's
			safe.
			USS Stargazer. Constitution
			Class. Starfleet Registry NCC
			2893...
			I activated the emergency power
			cells...
			Amazing they still work.
			The rest of the ship is all clear
			of surprises, Lieutenant Yar.
			When I read about this ship at
			the Academy, I never dreamed I'd
			ever be on her.
			Yar to Enterprise. All clear,
			sir.
			Thank you, Lieutenant. Captain?
			Yes, Commander
			Stargazer searched and secured,
			sir. Give her my best.
			I will that, Number One.
			Energize!
			Hello, old friend...
			You'll find this intriguing,
			Captain.
			What do you find, Data?
			Last entry was dated seven years
			ago, sir. By you...
			"We are forced to abandon our
			starship. May she find her way
			without us."
			Apparently, she did.
			How are you feeling, Captain?
			Fine, Doctor.
			Lieutenant Yar, run a structural
			analysis on the Stargazer for
			impulse tow.
			Data, download all computers to
			the Enterprise and file...
			I'm going to my old cabin.
			Try this, "Hero of Maxia."
			DAMNNNN!
			OHHHH!
			Captain?
			Another headache, sir?!
			That worries me. I want you back
			on the Enterprise.
			Yes, but... my things here...
			I'll see they're sent to your
			Enterprise quarters.
			Enterprise now taking possession
			of Stargazer, Kazago.
			Permission granted, Riker.
			Actually it was quite a bargain,
			Kazago. I thought the Ferengi
			always made a profit on things.
			Set sub-warp speed for towing,
			La Forge.
			Starfleet has responded to our
			request, sir. A tug will
			rendezvous with us and tow the
			Stargazer back to Xendi Starbase
			Nine.
			Very well, Data.
			How was it, Captain?
			Strange, Number One. Like
			visiting the house you grew up
			in, but no one's home, except the
			phantoms of the past...
			It has troubled you?
			Not as much as this damn headache,
			Counselor. Take over, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			What's wrong?
			I wish I could say.
			... shields weakening, Captain!
			Torpedoes armed! Where are they?
			Ohmygod, sir!
			Fire! Fire!!
			What is it, Data? Why all the
			mystery?
			It is the records of the Stargazer,
			sir. What the Ferengi call the
			"Battle of Maxia"...
			It seems the Captain's personal
			log contains a much different
			version of that conflict than the
			official historic account.
			What are you saying?
			It would appear that the starship
			which Captain Picard attacked,
			had in fact, been under a flag
			of truce...
			What?!
			And apparently, the captain
			destroyed the ship without notice
			or provocation.
			Impossible. What about the fire
			aboard the Stargazer?
			An accident in Engineering.
			And the proof?
			It is logged in his own voice.
			Would you care to hear it?
			Sir? Sir?
			First officer's personal log,
			stardate 41724.2. An unexpected
			discovery made by Commander Data
			in the downloaded log of the
			Stargazer...
			... appears to indicate Captain
			Picard was guilty of falsifying
			the report he made to Starfleet
			concerning the Stargazer's last
			voyage.
			What does this mean?
			I don't know, sir. That sounds
			like your voice.
			Don't you know it is, Number One?
			No, sir, I don't. I refuse to
			believe you could have said that.
			... and I admit I must have
			mistaken their subspace antenna
			for a weapons cluster.
			Unfortunately, I fired our main
			phasers...
			... and our direct hit destroyed
			the unknown vessel instantly.
			I recognize, of course, your voice
			has been simulated somehow. I've
			already put Data to work on it.
			Thank you, Will.
			I never made that log entry, of
			course. But it still creates a
			duty for you to perform.
			Yes, sir, I must report it to
			Starfleet. But at this distance,
			it will take at least a full day
			for subspace communications to
			reach there...
			... and another full day for their
			answer to return. I'd like the
			truth on this by then.
			Sir, you can't believe they'd
			relieve you from command...
			Why shouldn't they? Better safe
			than sorry with the Ferengi now
			making friendship overtures.
			And it's certain that the Ferengi
			are behind this faked log. No
			wonder they're still out there,
			waiting...
			Headache back, sir?
			Damn!
			I'll call the doctor again.
			It's no wonder you have one, with
			all this going on, sir.
			Try to relax. I've got things in
			hand.
			Once again...
			This is a confession, given by
			me, Jean-Luc Picard, commanding
			USS Stargazer, in the hopes that
			my belated honesty will be taken
			into account by Starfleet when
			judging...
			La Forge, open hailing frequencies.
			Open, sir.
			I'll take it in the Ready Room.
			A secure channel, Geordi.
			Secure, Commander.
			Starship Ferengi! This is
			Commander Riker here. I'd like
			to speak to First Officer Kazago.
			A problem, Riker?
			Is our channel secure on your end?
			It is now.
			Are you aware of the details of
			the Battle of Maxia?
			Captain Bok has just made me aware
			of it, Riker. The infamy of your
			Picard is now fully known.
			Infamy?!
			I would call the wanton
			destruction of an unarmed vessel
			infamy.
			And if I produce evidence that
			Captain Picard's log entry was
			falsified to indicate that... ?
			What else would your decadent
			culture say to defend such
			disgrace?! But I can hardly
			imagine you contacted me to
			discuss an ancient battle.
			What do you want of me?
			Just one question.
			As you humans say, I'm all ears.
			First officer to first officer,
			Kazago, if your Captain Bok knew
			of that, why this peaceful meeting
			to present us with the Stargazer?
			We freely give YOU back your
			derelict warship and now you
			accuse US of crime, Riker?!
			I can bear NO more insults!
			Who the hell is it?!
			Not resting, Captain?
			More like dying, Doctor. What's
			wrong with me?!
			I wish to hell I knew, Captain.
			But something unusual has
			definitely happened to you.
			Why do doctors always state the
			obvious like it's a revelation?
			Why do captains always think
			they're immortal?
			Better now?
			Aghhh! My head!
			Now that has to do it right?
			No!
			You didn't say it's been this bad!
			It hasn't been! But it is getting
			worse, Doctor...
			It has to be some kind of
			emotional pressure connected with
			the Stargazer...
			I got the damn headache before
			I even knew my old ship still
			existed...
			But maybe you're partly right...
			Want to talk to Counselor Troi
			about it?
			What I need now is a friend...
			I'm here.
			The Stargazer was an exploration
			vessel. The fight at Maxia was
			not my first action, but it was
			the first time I ever killed
			anyone.
			You had no choice...
			Didn't I? I don't know
			anymore... I just don't know.
			Commander Riker told me about the
			altered log, sir. If that's
			troubling you...
			The last three nights, I... hear
			voices. I'm standing on the
			bridge, fire all around me... the
			klaxons, smoke, and I give the
			order...
			And now the Stargazer is really
			here!
			And that log... Am I going crazy?
			How do I know if I was in my right
			mind at Maxia? How do I know if
			I'm in my right mind now?
			What was... that?
			Just something to let you sleep.
			Yes... sleep... I need sl...
			... shields weakening, Captain!
			Torpedoes armed!
			Where are they?
			And now, dear captain, you are
			ready to live the past!
			Where did they... come from?
			Phasers, sir? Sir?
			SIR?
			What should we do, sir?
			Should we fire back?
			Fire, Captain, FIRE!
			You will injure yourself as once
			you injured me!
			SIR?!
			Damage report!
			Fusion generator under surge
			control, sir!
			Power systems failing!
			Sensor bearing on hostile ship!
			Seven, seven mark nineteen, sir!
			Fire in Engineering...
			Ready phasers, and lock!
			Stand by for warp nine, heading
			seven, seven mark twenty...
			And ENGAGE!
			Steady. NOW reverse and stop!
			Phasers FIRE! Torpedoes AWAY!
			Fire!
			FIRE!!
			By comparing the main Stargazer
			computer log with Captain Picard's
			personal log, I have found
			"checksum" discrepancies, sir.
			What does that mean?
			All information is time-coded by
			entry, and the bits when totaled
			produce an aggregate amount
			which...
			I don't want a lesson in computer
			science! Bottom line?
			One of these two logs is a
			forgery.
			Correction -- the log just found
			aboard the Stargazer is a forgery.
			As I said. That is one of them,
			isn't it?
			You're looking better, Captain.
			A little sleep, thanks to the
			doctor, works wonders. Any report
			on the logs?
			Yes, sir. Whoever tampered with
			your personal log was clever...
			... but slightly clumsy. There's
			no doubt it is a fabrication.
			Number One, we think you should
			see this brain scan graph which...
			What are you doing here?!
			I thought I was captain of this
			starship, Doctor.
			Of course you are, but I...
			Thank you for your confirmation
			of that.
			But now, except for Commander
			Riker, I want you all back at your
			stations...
			Is that clear?
			I have some business concerning
			your health, sir...
			I mean you too, Doctor. I have
			business with Riker.
			Under protest, Captain.
			You have orders for me, sir?
			Release the Stargazer from the
			tractor beam, Number One.
			Sir?
			The tractor beam.
			Sir, are you abandoning...
			No. Her inertia will carry the
			Stargazer along on this heading
			with us. Or did you sleep through
			the Academy lecture on conserving
			tractor beam power?
			No, sir. I'll release her, or
			course.
			Obviously, there is some thought
			process disorder here but I cannot
			find any physical reason for it.
			Anything?
			I'm puzzled too. I keep sensing
			random thoughts... but two sets
			of them. As if they were his,
			but intermixed with his from
			another source.
			I'm busy at the moment, Wesley...
			I know you're busy, Mom, but when
			I went back to the main sensors
			in Engineering to try some more
			sensitivity experiments...
			Wes! I'll be glad to hear about
			it when I'm through with...
			But, Mom, this is important!
			Does it have something to do with
			Captain Picard?
			Yes, ma'am...
			... if that's what you're talking
			about there. I don't know
			anything about brain scans but
			I glanced at these when you were
			studying them, Mom, and I
			noticed...
			... these patterns here were like
			patterns of the low-intensity
			transmissions picked up from the
			Ferengi ship.
			I just went back and checked and
			they're exactly the same.
			What kind of transmissions?
			I don't know. Engineering has
			nothing like it on record.
			Let's get to the captain...
			No, they might be affecting the
			captain. To Riker!
			You're welcome, ladies.
			Adults!
			The captain, Commander?
			Resting in his quarters...
			... after ordering both of you
			to your duty stations.
			This is more important!
			Than the captain's orders?
			Yes, when we have reason to
			believe his judgment is being
			affected.
			Well then, why not let everyone
			in on it?
			It affects them too. There have
			been some strange...
			Did he say "low intensity... ?"
			... unusual low intensity
			transmissions from the Ferengi
			vessel...
			Did who say?
			My son!
			... transmissions which exactly
			match certain anomalies found in
			the captain's brain scans.
			Something over there is affecting
			Captain Picard's thought patterns.
			Computer, tell me Captain Picard's
			location!
			Captain Picard is in Transporter
			Room Three.
			What? Computer, emergency order
			to Transporter Room Three...
			New information. Captain Picard
			is no longer aboard the
			Enterprise.
			Welcome back, Captain.
			What is happening?
			Shields up, computer.
			Shields in place.
			What are you doing?
			Collecting on an old debt...
			AGHHH-H-H!!
			Stargazer! Respond, Captain!
			Shields up, sir. No way to beam
			over help.
			I am reading something very
			strange. A low intensity beam
			of intermittent pulse inside this
			starship.
			I have a fix on it...
			Inside Captain Picard's quarters.
			You transferred some of his
			belongings from the Stargazer... ?
			Including a fairly heavy chest... !
			Go take a look, fast!
			The Stargazer is powering up!
			I have been waiting a long seven
			years for this, Picard!
			I have no idea what you're talking
			about...
			Do you not, hu-man? Can you not
			remember the crime you committed
			against my very blood?
			You murdered my only son!
			Your son?
			He was the commander of the ship
			you destroyed!)
			On his first voyage as DaiMon.
			The ship... ? The... the Ferengi
			ship that attacked me...
			... or is it about to attack me?
			And I have spent these years
			searching... seeking... a proper
			blood revenge. And I found it!
			OHHHHH... ! OHHHHH... !
			From a distant world which hu-man
			evil has not yet reached. May
			you never secure these! I am rich,
			yet two of these cost me the
			profits of an entire life.
			You cannot... control me like...
			Die well, Picard.
			First officer's log, stardate
			41724.3. Captain Picard, without
			explanation, has beamed himself
			to the Stargazer which is now
			moving away from us...
			... under its own power.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Enterprise to Stargazer, please
			respond.
			Enterprise to Stargazer... to
			Captain Picard aboard Stargazer,
			please answer.
			Mister Data, what was Stargazer's
			condition?
			Considerable fire damage to
			interior surface as reported, sir.
			But none of her main systems are
			crippled.
			Armaments, Lieutenant Yar?
			Six photon torpedoes short, sir,
			probably used when the Captain
			destroyed his Ferengi attacker
			seven years ago. Otherwise fully
			armed.
			Where in the Captain's quarters
			was it, Mister Worf?
			His chest from the Stargazer, sir.
			Just where I had left it -- he
			hadn't yet unpacked.
			So, he may not have even known
			it was there. And if this is able
			to pick up or magnify a
			thought-altering transmission...
			... it could have prepared him for
			whatever's happening now.
			Let's find out... or try to.
			Contact the Ferengi vessel,
			Lieutenant.
			Hailing frequencies open, sir.
			Enterprise to Ferengi vessel, we
			transmit visually. Do you
			respond?
			Why is our gift to you under
			power, hu-man?
			I'll discuss that with your
			captain.
			He is working in our ship's
			laboratory. Where is your
			captain?
			He's beamed himself aboard the
			Stargazer, and I'm wondering...
			... if this has anything to do with
			it?
			How do you have possession of
			that?
			It was found in our captain's
			belongings, brought over from the
			Stargazer.
			It... is a forbidden device. A
			Thought Maker. If your captain
			is... criminal enough to own one...
			Kazago, I ask again, first officer
			to first officer... what is going
			on? Something is happening that
			neither of us seems to know about.
			It... is not seemly to question
			one's own DaiMon, Riker. I... am
			not prepared to do that...
			Sir... I have the Stargazer.
			Switch now!
			Captain Picard, this is the
			Enterprise, sir...
			Do not attack again! We are on
			a peaceful...
			He's living a delusion, sir. He's
			seeing things we don't...
			Give your identity! You force
			us to defend ourselves!
			Phasers full up! Arm torpedoes!
			Why aren't shields at full
			power... ?
			We've lost him, sir...
			When he put the shields up...
			Damn, I said...
			... put fusion generators on surge
			control.
			You're moving too slowly. Arm
			the torpedoes, man!
			Vigo! Get a fire control party
			up here!
			Shields weakening, Captain!
			Weapons report!
			Phasers coming to full charge,
			sir. Torpedoes armed!
			Who are they? Identify them!
			They're turning for a third pass
			at us, sir!
			We can't take another hit,
			Captain!
			I can now feel anger from our
			captain, first officer.
			Frustration over whatever he
			is re-living...
			The Battle of Maxia, sir! That's
			all it can be.
			Mister Data?
			What is that "maneuver" he became
			famous for... ?
			The Picard Maneuver!
			Mister Data, what is the defense
			against that?
			There is no defense, sir.
			Then devise one! Fast!
			First Officer Kazago to hu-man
			Riker.
			Not now, Kazago!
			We do not wish to become involved
			in what has become clearly a
			Federation matter...
			Fine, fine, Enterprise out!
			But you should also know that
			DaiMon Bok no longer commands this
			vessel, Riker. His first officer
			has confined him for engaging in
			this unprofitable adventure.
			Good luck, First Officer Riker.
			I have computed a possibility,
			Commander. Since even deep space
			contains trace gases, sir, a
			vessel in the Picard maneuver
			might seem to disappear, but our
			sensors could locate any sudden
			compression of those gases...
			And use it as an aiming point?
			Blast our own captain to bits?
			Aim our tractor beam at it, sir!
			Seize it! This class starship has
			enough power for that.
			In our captain's words... make
			it so! Set sensors, tractor
			beam...
			I hope you're right, Data...
			No question of it, sir...
			Stand by!
			Lock on tractor beam!
			Ready phasers!
			Captain Picard, listen to me!
			Is that you, Vigo?
			It's Commander Riker, sir!
			Captain, hear me! Look around
			you, the Ferengi are using a
			thought device on you...
			Stand by for warp...
			Who are you?!
			It's Riker, sir. Your Number One.
			Look for a silver sphere...
			There it is! Destroy it with
			your phaser, Captain!
			Phaser...
			Yes, a sphere... Bok used it...
			Destory it!
			Phaser... destroy the sphere.
			Captain! Are you all right?
			Enterprise, lock on. Beam me
			home, Riker.
