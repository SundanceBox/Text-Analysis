			Commander Riker, report to the
			bridge.
			On the way.
			What's your hurry, Harry?
			Oops. Sorry, Commander. I was,
			um, just...
			Harry!
			I'm sorry if he bothered you.
			No bother, Doctor Bernard.
			I'm not going back. I hate that
			teacher. And I hate calculus.
			Everyone needs an understanding
			of basic calculus, whether they
			like it or not.
			Why?
			You're limping.
			A small run-in with an aspiring
			sprinter.
			Ah, Number One.
			A problem, Captain?
			A curiosity. For the past several
			hours we have been tracking faint
			energy readings in an attempt to
			locate the source. It's been like
			following a trail of bread crumbs.
			The path lead here and stopped
			-- which is what I knew would
			interest you.
			What's our position?
			The Epsilon Mynos system.
			Really? Thank you, Captain;
			you're right... I wouldn't miss
			this for anything.
			What's so interesting about this
			system?
			Aldea.
			Tasha -- I'm surprised. You mean
			you've never heard the stories
			about Aldea? A wonderous mythical
			world -- like Atlantis on ancient
			earth... or Neinman on Xerxes
			Seven... with an advanced culture,
			centuries old. Self-contained,
			peaceful, with incredible
			technical sophistication which
			provided for every citizen's daily
			needs, allowing them to devote
			themselves to culture and art,
			which was beautiful beyond compare
			and valued beyond price.
			Where is it supposed to be?
			Ahh -- that is the myth -- somehow --
			so the legend goes -- the Aldeans
			were able to cloak their planet
			in darkness and go unseen by
			marauders and other hostile
			passersby who might rob and
			plunder.
			A wonderful fairy tale.
			Scanners still show nothing, sir.
			Scanners may show nothing,
			Captain, but I am sensing
			something very strong.
			Thousands of minds, sir.
			Where?
			Very close.
			All stop.
			Answering all stop.
			Anything?
			Captain, I am recording a
			distortion in quadrant one, mark
			nine-zero.
			On screen.
			Shields and deflectors up.
			Aye, sir.
			Aldea, Captain... It has to be.
			Captain's log, stardate 41509.1.
			Either by chance or intent, we've
			been led to the mythical planet
			of Aldea, which appeared out of
			nowhere, hidden behind a
			sophisticated shielding device.
			Captain, the sensors indicate that
			the shield is electromagnetic. A
			complicated light refracting
			mechanism.
			A cloaking device.
			Yes, sir.
			To hide an entire planet it's
			gotta be pretty sophisticated.
			We're being scanned, sir.
			Let's let them know our peaceful
			intent. Open hailing frequencies,
			Lieutenant Yar.
			I'm Rashella. Welcome to Aldea.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the USS Enterprise. We come in
			peace.
			We know.
			We've heard the stories about
			Aldea, but frankly never thought
			they could possibly be true.
			Our shield has confused outsiders
			for millennia, Captain.
			A very long time to have that kind
			of technology. Why are you
			revealing yourself now?
			We're eager to meet in person to
			discuss that, and other subjects
			of mutual interest.
			We're ready anytime.
			Excellent!
			Our arrival seems to have startled
			you.
			We mean no harm.
			It was a little sudden
			I'm Radue, First Appointee of Aldea.
			Welcome aboard.
			Captain, they haven't been through
			decontamination.
			It's all right.
			Our medical doctor is concerned
			you didn't go through our regular
			transporting procedure.
			You couldn't transport us. The
			only way through our shield is
			our way, Captain. Our cloaking
			device may be off, but our shield
			is operating. We've brought you
			small tokens of welcome.
			And our personal invitation to
			a celebration on Aldea.
			We'd be delighted. Number One,
			assemble your away team.
			We will prepare for your arrival,
			Commander Riker.
			How did you know...
			... your name? We've been
			monitoring your ship's
			communications. We must return
			now to Aldea. Our eyes are very
			sensitive to bright light.
			Rashella, Garen.
			Amazing. Only to exist in
			mythology and suddenly they're
			here, right in front of us.
			Number One?
			Now you know who placed the
			bread crumbs. We're not here by
			accident.
			Counselor? What do you sense?
			Only the obvious. They want
			something from us.
			Commander Riker, is your party
			ready?
			Interesting choices.
			I hope Duana and I know how to
			greet you properly, Commander.
			"May your light shine through the
			ages."
			My apologies. Age has no respect
			for the body.
			How do they cloak the planet?
			The theory is simple. The shield
			bends light rays around the
			planet's contour -- similar to the
			Romulan cloaking device -- but the
			implementation is very difficult.
			Wesley!
			Sir, the energy beam is
			originating from Aldea.
			Shields up. La Forge, contact
			Commander Riker. Worf, check
			all other decks.
			Shields inoperable, sir. All
			decks are being probed in a
			methodical pattern.
			All decks? Everything? The entire
			ship?
			Aye, sir!
			Captain, I can't get through to
			Commander Riker. We're being
			blocked.
			Are you all right, Wesley?
			It was scary at first, but I
			really didn't feel anything.
			Sir, similar incidents, all decks,
			but only with the children.
			Yes, Commander, we are an ancient
			power. But we've suffered for
			it. Our history is littered with
			the deaths of those people who
			craved more and more things.
			Nothing was ever enough. So,
			we've evolved a very simple way
			of living: for whatever is taken,
			something is given in return.
			It seems an equitable code.
			It's given us peace.
			Unfortunately, there are very few
			of us left to enjoy it.
			Why?
			That is some of what we wish to
			discuss. We need help from the
			Federation to rebuild our
			heritage... we need a younger
			generation, strong and healthy,
			following in the Aldean
			traditions.
			I don't understand. How can the
			Federation help influence your
			children in your traditions?
			Because we have no children,
			Commander. Rashella was the last
			child born on this planet.
			And your medical community can
			do nothing?
			They've tried, Doctor Crusher.
			And failed.
			Perhaps we can help...
			Radue, exactly why have we been
			invited to Aldea?
			We propose a trade. One which
			will solve our problem and give
			something back to the Federation.
			And the nature of this trade?
			We need some of your children.
			In payment, we will give you the
			kind of knowledge which would take
			you centuries to acquire.
			That might be acceptable to some
			other races, but humans are
			unusually attached to their own
			offspring.
			We sympathize with your situation,
			Radue. But what you ask is not
			possible.
			And that's your final answer?
			It's my only answer. If we can
			be of help in some other way...
			I am sorry you are intransigent.
			Wes!
			Saucer Section reports six more
			children are gone.
			It's the children. That's why
			we've been brought here. That's
			what they wanted.
			And that's what they have.
			Status!
			Aldean shields still up. Hailing
			frequencies open. No response.
			Keep trying, Lieutenant.
			Counselor, gather the parents.
			They'll need to talk to you as
			well, Captain.
			Captain, your children are with
			us.
			... Go on.
			My word of honor... no harm will
			ever come to them.
			Harm has already been done.
			Captain, let us begin discussions
			regarding appropriate
			compensation.
			Compensation! You steal our
			children -- from their classrooms
			-- their bedrooms -- and you talk
			about compensation. Return
			them... now!
			We will continue this discussion
			when you've calmed down.
			I shouldn't have lost my temper.
			Wesley, I'm frightened.
			I know. We all are, but it's
			going to be all right. Everyone
			knows where we are. No one is
			going to hurt you. I promise.
			Alexandra, don't go too far!
			She's not afraid of anything.
			Harry, don't touch that!
			I'm not gonna hurt it.
			I know that. But maybe they
			don't.
			Who?
			I don't know who.
			Why are we here?
			I don't know that either.
			Greetings, Wesley Crusher.
			How did you know my name?
			Oh, through that energy beam.
			Excellent analysis. The Custodian
			indicated you would be the leader.
			The Custodian -- who is the
			Custodian?
			The Custodian is not a person.
			We have brought you to Aldea as
			our guests. We'll provide
			anything you need or want.
			We want to go home.
			Wesley, all of you have been
			chosen because you are special.
			Children, we are starting on a
			wonderful adventure.
			Exactly... Just ask for anything
			you want, and you shall have it.
			Bye-bye.
			What happened to Alexandra and
			the other children, Captain? How
			are you getting them back?
			Toya, sit down... You're
			reacting out of fear.
			We all knew what the risks were
			when we signed on. And that's
			the choice we made. Captain
			Picard will do everything possible
			to bring our children back.
			The Aldeans are anxious to discuss
			"compensation." That will buy
			us time. I've asked Doctor
			Crusher to be involved in the
			negotiations as your
			representative.
			Why were these specific children
			taken?
			We can't be sure. We do know the
			Aldeans can't have children of
			their own.
			Then they won't let them go
			easily.
			I won't insult you by pretending
			it will be easy. I can only say
			the Enterprise will not leave them
			behind. Be assured of that.
			Can we talk with our children?
			Give them some reassurance. Let
			them know that we are here, and
			that they will be safe.
			I will do my best to arrange it.
			The last time I saw him I yelled
			at him.
			There you are!
			I have you now!
			Any response from Aldea,
			Lieutenant Yar?
			Not yet, sir.
			Captain, Data has found something
			interesting. The Aldean shield
			gives evidence of sporadic
			fluctuations, weakening its
			structure in isolated sections.
			You're saying there are holes in
			their defense system?
			In essence, yes. It is surprising
			after all these eons that the
			Aldeans' use of their technology
			is not perfect. One would assume
			they would be aware of the
			weakness and repair it.
			Can we beam down an away team
			through one of these so-called
			holes?
			It is a possibility. It would
			have to be perfectly timed -- and
			there are no guarantees.
			We may be more successful in
			deciphering the code they use
			to transport through the magnetic
			shield.
			Can you do that?
			Eventually, sir. I am working
			on it now but the number of
			permutations is almost endless.
			Keep trying.
			Number One, while he's doing that,
			you find a way of getting through
			one of those holes because one way
			or the other we have to get an away
			team on that planet, locate the
			power source of that shield and
			neutralize it.
			You're certain they'll negotiate?
			Oh, they'll negotiate, Number One.
			Or call it that. They took what
			they wanted, now they'll
			rationalize it by throwing us some
			sort of bone.
			A bone, sir? In exchange for the
			children?
			Oh. A metaphor.
			And when we don't accept their
			offer?
			The minute they believe we will
			accept no compensation for the
			children, they will end all
			discussion and disappear behind
			their shield... locking us out
			and the children in -- forever.
			That's why I have to keep them
			talking.
			Excuse me, sir, where are you
			taking Tara?
			What's happening? I thought you
			said the captain was going to
			rescue us!
			He will. It just might take him
			a little while.
			Come in.
			Don't be alarmed. The other
			children have been assigned to
			their units.
			Units?
			A unit is a group where people
			of similar talents and interests
			live together.
			Like a family.
			Yes, you could call it that.
			We already have families.
			Does Captain Picard know what you
			are doing?
			We are keeping nothing from him.
			We have been waiting for you so
			long, Harry. We are artists, just
			like you.
			I'm not an artist.
			You will be. And a great one.
			This way, Harry.
			Unit B -- three seven five.
			Katie.
			I am honored.
			Thank you.
			Melian is the foremost musician
			on Aldea.
			Music speaks its own language...
			I know we'll have much to learn
			from each other.
			Don't worry, Katie. You'll be
			seeing Wesley soon.
			We're the only ones left, Wesley.
			Does that tell you something?
			Do you want me to guess?
			No. You'll be staying with Radue
			and me. As First Unit we require
			someone with innate leadership
			ability -- and a great mind. You
			have both. We need you, Wesley.
			What about me? Don't I have a
			say in this?
			Wesley, sometimes things happen
			which we just must accept. You
			and the other children are now
			members of this society. That
			will not change. It's up to you
			to make the transition as easy
			as possible for the others. You
			are their leader. It's your duty.
			Help them accept it -- because
			nothing you, or those on the
			starship can do will change it.
			Because like you, we also have
			no choice.
			We'll do our best to see you're
			happy here. And I promise you
			one thing: the secrets of Aldea's
			power will one day be yours.
			Where have you been Rashella?
			Zena and Aran are waiting to take
			Alexandra.
			No.
			No? I told you...
			No, Radue. They can't have her.
			I will never let her go.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			remain in orbit around Aldea.
			It's becoming all too evident that
			talk will not effect the return
			of our children. We must
			neutralize the Aldean shield.
			Until then we are helpless.
			Sir, Radue is hailing us.
			Captain Picard.
			Doctor Crusher and I are ready,
			Radue.
			Are you ill, Captain?
			No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff
			Officer, Radue. Starfleet
			Regulation 6.57 requires at least
			two staff officers to be present
			during any treaty or contract
			negotiations.
			Very well.
			Not much on pleasantries, is he?
			I am not aware of Regulation 6.57,
			sir.
			Neither am I, Data.
			Oh. I see.
			Doctor Crusher, report to the
			bridge... Now we'll see what they
			have in mind.
			Over here, Wesley.
			Custodian, Wesley Crusher's voice
			will be entered into the
			authorized file -- for Third Level
			clearance.
			Proceed, Duana.
			Announce yourself to the
			Custodian.
			Hello, Custodian. I'm Wesley
			Crusher.
			Hello, Wesley. Your voice will
			now activate Third Level
			clearance.
			Thank you. What does that mean?
			You may ask any questions you
			wish.
			Thank you. Duana, what does the
			Custodian do?
			It frees us from all burden. It
			takes care of all our needs. It
			regulates our lives.
			Who built it?
			The Progenitors.
			When?
			Before my time. Centuries ago.
			... What's its power source?
			Wesley, why is that important?
			It does what we ask it. It always
			has. What difference does it make
			how it works?
			If you don't know how it works,
			how can you repair it?
			Why would we want to repair it?
			From time to time, every computer
			-- I mean Custodian -- requires
			maintainance.
			Wesley, Radue is right. You ask
			questions I can't answer. Ask
			the Custodian instead.
			Custodian, can you show me where
			Harry is?
			Yes.
			Show me Harry.
			I never did this before. It's
			fun.
			You are going to make Harry into
			a sculptor?
			He already is. He has just never
			been encouraged properly. The
			tool Leda is giving him will allow
			him to bring out his visions.
			It will take years for him to
			learn to do that.
			Oh, no. It will happen quite
			quickly.
			Custodian, show me Alexandra.
			Custodian, show me Jason...
			Stop, Custodian.
			We must work now... there is much
			to learn.
			What's in there?
			It's probably the power source.
			I don't know. It's forbidden.
			The Custodian allows no one in
			there. There's no one left who's
			authorized.
			Open hailing frequency, Lieutenant
			Yar.
			Open, sir.
			Ah, good. You're ready.
			I want to see the children before
			we begin.
			No. We're here to negotiate for
			compensation, not to pander to
			emotions. This way.
			Radue, we do not condone your
			actions. You're attempting to
			salve your conscience by offering
			goods in exchange for our
			children.
			Why do you want them back so
			badly? You can always make more.
			We happen to like these particular
			children.
			Humans have great attachment to
			their offspring. But we're
			digressing. Returning the
			children is non-negotiable.
			I promise you they will have a
			beautiful life with us. And
			they'll be father and mother to
			a new breed born of an ancient
			culture.
			What makes you think they'll be
			able to have children? You can't.
			But they will. Our inability to
			bear children is a genetic
			dysfunction. It's not contagious.
			Radue, we do sympathize. But
			surely there is a solution which
			can be mutually satisfactory.
			For us, the problem is solved.
			We are offering you information
			on areas of the galaxy you don't
			even know exist. What more can
			we offer? What more would you
			want?
			A significant beginning, I think.
			But first I must ask again that
			Doctor Crusher be allowed to speak
			with her son before we continue.
			You are a very stubborn people.
			Ah, well, that can be a positive
			trait. You may see him.
			Mom!
			I knew the captain would get us
			home.
			Not yet, Wes.
			Oh. I thought... never mind.
			Are you okay? And the others?
			Okay, really okay. Everyone's
			been assigned their own units...
			you know, like families. We're
			being treated, well, almost like
			gods.
			Don't let it go to your head.
			I won't.
			So, what have you been doing?
			I'm learning a lot. They have a
			computer which they call the
			Custodian. It controls
			everything.
			The captain should know this.
			All their defense systems, the
			city's environment, everything.
			And it's all voice command. So
			simple. But the amazing thing
			is the Aldeans don't know how it
			works. They know how to talk to
			it, but they don't even know what
			its power source is, and they
			didn't do the original
			programming.
			They said that later on, when I'm
			really an Aldean, I'll know all
			their secrets.
			That won't happen, Wes. I promise
			I won't let that happen.
			You must leave, Doctor Crusher.
			Take care of yourself.
			I will, Mom.
			Wes seems fine. He says the other
			children are too.
			Of course they're well.
			Captain Picard, you have our
			offer. It is final. Rashella.
			Captain, we want you to understand
			the nature of your choice. A
			small demonstration of our
			power...
			What was that?
			I believe it was a repulsor beam,
			sir.
			Position report.
			It's unbelievable, sir. According
			to my calculations, we're three
			days from Aldea -- at warp nine.
			They call that a "small"
			Demonstration?
			Geordi, take us back to Aldea
			orbit. Warp factor nine.
			Captain, if you don't accept our
			terms, the Enterprise will be
			pushed so far away, by the time
			you get back, your children will
			be grandparents.
			Captain's log, stardate 41509.45.
			We are twenty hours away from
			Aldea, and no closer to a
			solution. Their deliberate show
			of force pushed us out of orbit
			and could have disintegrated the
			ship. In the face of that power,
			a direct assault on Aldea would
			be disastrous.
			Now, hold it a little bit more
			firmly.
			That's it. Perfect. Now...
			think. No, think's not right.
			Feel the notes inside your head.
			I'm sorry! Did I break it?
			No. It's all right. You can't
			break it.
			It did exactly what I thought...
			I mean, felt.
			Yes. It's a direct expression
			of the music within. Now we just
			have to teach you to structure
			that feeling...
			That was beautiful. Now play
			something happier.
			That's not how I feel.
			I don't want to do this anymore.
			You see, Harry, I told you you
			were going to be an artist.
			Are you sure? Did I really do
			this?
			Oh, yes. Your talent has always
			been there. The sculpting tool
			is just helping you develop it.
			It's what you were meant to do.
			You mean I don't have to do
			calculus anymore?
			You don't have to do anything you
			don't want to do. What's
			calculus?
			Nothing important. Can I do some
			more?
			Captain's log, supplemental. It
			has been three days since the
			Aldeans pushed us away. We have
			had no contact with Radue since
			then.
			Lieutenant Yar, open hailing
			frequencies.
			Frequencies open, sir.
			Radue, this is Captain Picard.
			Welcome back, Captain. What have
			you decided?
			There is room for discussion,
			Radue.
			We will bring you down when we
			are ready.
			Data, find a way to defeat that
			shield.
			That may be impossible, sir.
			Things are impossible, until
			they're not.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain, here's what I've learned.
			Duana is dying. I have no reason
			to believe the rest of the Aldeans
			are any healthier.
			We're all dying, Doctor. Can you
			be more specific?
			They're suffering from some kind
			of chromosomal damage. It could
			be genetic, or environmental.
			Then that's why they can't
			conceive.
			Yes. It also explains their lack
			of appetite, their sensitivity
			to light, and their extreme
			pallor.
			An entire civilization that's
			terminally ill... is it
			reversible?
			I won't know until I've found the
			cause... and you don't need to
			tell me time is running out.
			Good work, Doctor.
			I thought growing boys are always
			hungry.
			You didn't eat anything.
			We need very little.
			I know you miss your family. But
			you will grow accustomed to us.
			I promise. I promise you'll be
			happy.
			You can keep me here, but you
			can't make me want to stay.
			You'll never be able to make me
			forget. And I'll never be an
			Aldean.
			Have the lesions gone?
			Yes. The medicine worked again.
			Good. Come see what Harry's
			doing.
			Beautiful!
			It really turned out well.
			It is so graceful and alive. What
			do you call it?
			It's a dolphin.
			Dolphin?
			You know, it swims in the ocean.
			Like a fish, only it's not a fish.
			Ah. A fish. We used to have them
			in our oceans. I've never seen
			one before.
			I used to live near the ocean.
			On Zadar IV. My dad's an
			oceanographer. He says... never
			mind. It doesn't matter.
			No. That doesn't fit the pattern.
			Give me a list of the appropriate
			medical literature from the
			twenty-second century.
			There's not enough time!
			Is there anything I can do?
			You just did, Jean-Luc. Now...
			I have to get back to work.
			I want Mommy!
			Custodian's room.
			Custodian, this is Wesley Crusher.
			Proceed, Wesley.
			Show me where all the Enterprise
			children are in relation to this
			room.
			Thank you.
			Custodian, what's your instruction
			set?
			How can I command your attention?
			Do you have a non-maskable
			interrupt?
			Yes.
			What is its address?
			Zero, twelve, twenty-two,
			twenty-one, twenty-three,
			twenty-six.
			That doesn't make any sense to
			me.
			Custodian, what's in the locked
			room next to this one?
			You are not authorized for that
			information.
			Thank you. Good night.
			Good night, Wesley.
			I need your help. I have an idea
			how we can get home.
			Why will not talking or eating
			make them send us home?
			It's called "passive resistance."
			We don't do anything they want
			us to do and then they won't want
			us.
			Will they get mad at us?
			They won't hurt us.
			But, Wes, I do kind of like them.
			So do I, but I don't want to stay
			here forever. Do you?
			No, but I like working with the
			wood.
			Harry, we all have to do this
			together or it won't work.
			Okay. I'll do it.
			What are you all doing here
			together?
			What is going on here?
			Garen!
			Take the children back to their
			units.
			The Aldeans are suffering from
			a form of radiation poisoning.
			And that's what's made the Aldeans
			sterile?
			Yes.
			Is it reversible?
			Of course.
			Captain, these permutations are
			going to take a very long time.
			How long?
			Weeks.
			Captain, there is another option.
			We have identified a weakness in
			the shield.
			But it's not constant.
			It's a hole.
			It's not a hole as much as it is
			a fluctuation.
			Still, there is a chance.
			Captain, if we can time it exactly
			-- I think we can beam a team
			through the hole and onto the
			planet.
			Then why can't we beam the
			children up through the hole?
			The timing would be more
			difficult, and the risk greater.
			What are you suggesting, Number
			One?
			Beam through the hole. Locate
			the source of the shield, and
			knock it out.
			I'll try to delay the Aldeans
			until you're ready.
			Will you at least eat?
			I know you're hungry. We all are,
			but Alexandra, we are not going
			to eat anything. It's our way
			of telling them that we want to
			go home. Do you understand?
			Captain Picard. You may come down
			now to conclude our discussion,
			or your ship may leave. It is
			your choice.
			We are ready, Captain.
			Doctor Crusher and I are prepared
			to conclude these negotiations.
			Transporter room, now!
			Energize.
			Before we begin, Captain, you must
			speak with the children. It seems
			they are on some sort of "strike."
			I don't understand it. You must
			deal with this, Captain. I'm
			not very good with children.
			A strike? I'll see what I can
			do.
			Sir! We knew you'd come!
			It's not over yet, Wesley.
			Captain, I think I figured out
			their computer controls -- I'm
			not sure, it's a different system
			than ours.
			Good, Wesley. Now...
			...Captain.
			Yes, Harry.
			If something happens and you have
			to leave us here -- tell my Dad...
			I'm sorry I made him angry... and
			I miss him.
			I will tell him, Harry, and I will
			tell him how much I admire his
			son.
			This is it, Commander.
			It is programmed to accept only
			authorized voice commands.
			So we can't override.
			No. But I can intermix the input
			so nobody else can.
			We must find the power supply for
			the shield.
			What is this?
			They want to go home.
			No. They're staying.
			Number One.
			We are in position.
			Hold for orders.
			Aye, sir.
			The radiation levels on Aldea have
			built up over a long period of
			time. It is similar to what was
			experienced on Earth in the
			twenty-first century, when the
			ozone layer deteriorated and the
			surface of the planet was flooded
			with ultraviolet radiation.
			The shield that protects your
			world in one way has weakened it
			in another. It's the radiation
			of your own sun which is
			destroying you.
			You are trying to confuse the
			issue.
			Please listen. You're all
			suffering from a kind of
			poisoning. Sterility is only the
			latest symptom. If the children
			remain, they will be affected as
			well.
			It is impossible. Our scientists
			would have known.
			How could they? Your scientists
			have forgotten how everything
			works.
			No. It's a lie. Send them back
			to their ship.
			Wait. No. What if they're right?
			Instead of the children being our
			hope, what if we are just
			condeming them to our fate?
			They are just protecting their
			own interests.
			As are we. But hear them out.
			The captain and Doctor Crusher
			are saying our entire life is
			based on a misconception, and the
			very thing which has given us this
			wonderful world is the very thing
			which has caused this tragedy?
			That is exactly it. The shield
			that protects you, has weakened
			and your computer has controlled
			your lives so completely you've
			lost the desire to even question
			it.
			Lies. The discussion is over.
			Commander Riker.
			Yes, sir.
			I assume you have control of the
			computer.
			We've disabled the system
			temporarily and we've found the
			power source to the shield and
			we've neutralized it.
			Good.
			Enterprise, this is Picard. Beam
			the children up.
			Wait.
			Thank you.
			Let me get the dolphin for you
			to take with you.
			No. You keep it. I'll make
			another.
			Beam them up.
			You've destroyed us.
			We are not here to destroy you,
			Radue. We can help you.
			What is it?
			The legacy your Progenitors left
			you, Radue. The source of your
			power. And your problems.
			It is reading incredible amounts
			of energy, sir. Even more since
			we have taken down the shield.
			What are we going to do with it?
			Learn all over again... all this
			time we've been destroying
			ourselves. So secure, so sure
			of our technological
			invulnerability. Now...
			Will you let us help?
			Yes. Please.
			Dad, I want to be an artist. And
			I don't want to take calculus
			anymore.
			You can be anything you want,
			Harry. Anything. But you still
			have to take calculus.
			Okay. Thanks, Dad.
			It worked well, sir.
			Are you finished?
			Yes. They're responding very well
			to the treatment, but for this
			to work, they can never use their
			shield or be cloaked again.
			The legend will die, but the
			people will live.
			And we know they'll make good
			parents.
			Wesley!
			Sorry, sir. She just wanted to
			give you a present for bringing
			her back to her mommy.
			Mister La Forge, out of orbit.
			Warp five.
			Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
