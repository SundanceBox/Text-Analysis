			Captain's log, stardate 41801.3.
			We are crossing through the Zed
			Lapis sector, where we will
			rendezvous with Shuttlecraft
			Thirteen carrying Deanna Troi,
			who is returning from a
			psychology conference.
			Because Engineering is taking this
			opportunity to complete preventive
			maintenance on dilithium
			crystals, we are traveling on
			impulse power.
			Routine deep sensor probe
			indicates no obstacles, no vessels
			within a range of three light
			years.
			Short-range sub-space radar
			confirms.
			The martial arts competition is
			in three days. Are you prepared?
			If you'll meet me on the Holodeck
			later. I need your help on the
			Mishiama wrist-lock and break.
			If it works on you, I can use it
			on anyone.
			A valid assumption. Who is your
			first competitor?
			The aikido match is with Science
			Officer Swenson.
			You will defeat him easily.
			I'm more concerned with Lieutenant
			Minnerly's kick-boxing.
			You are favored in the ship's
			pool.
			You bet on me.
			A sure thing.
			Sir, estimated rendezvous with
			the shuttle in one hour, ten
			minutes.
			Very good, Lieutenant.
			It's not the same around here
			without Counselor Troi, is it,
			Number One?
			No, sir. It seems...
			... Sir! I am receiving an
			emergency transmission from the
			shuttle!
			Put it on the Main Viewer.
			I can't. We are receiving audio
			only.
			Then open the frequency.
			Aye, sir.
			... what a jolt!
			Position report.
			Sir, I have an onboard systems
			failure. You'll have to tell
			me where I am.
			I read coordinates three-zero-seven
			mark one-two-six. Confirm!
			Can't confirm. My instruments
			are haywire.
			Lieutenant Prieto, is Counselor
			Troi all right?
			Yes, sir. Just a little shaken.
			We're being buffeted a bit...
			... losing more power! My flight
			control computer's fried.
			Main Engineering!
			Engineering. Lieutenant
			Commander Leland T. Lynch
			reporting, sir.
			How long will it take to return
			to warp power?
			Captain! I'm in the middle of
			realigning the dilithium
			crystals.
			There's an emergency, Lynch. I
			need warp drive. How long?
			Twenty minutes. Maybe more.
			We don't have it.
			I'll align it by hand. Then
			power up the core.
			Whatever it takes.
			Aye, sir.
			Let's go!
			Shuttle, this is the Enterprise.
			Coordinates now read two-thirty-seven
			mark one-oh-one. You're
			moving in too close towards a
			large mass.
			I can see it. The planet's
			getting closer.
			The planet is Vagra Two of the
			Zed Lapis system. Uninhabited.
			Lieutenant, report!
			This is Counselor Troi. I'll
			relay, sir. The pilot is...
			busy. We've lost most of our
			impulse power.
			Engineering! Status report!
			Working on it. Three minutes,
			Captain. But there are no
			guarantees.
			Deanna, we'll be right there.
			... We're spinning around...
			We're caught in the planet's
			gravity.
			We're going to crash.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			We've lost all contact with
			Shuttlecraft Thirteen -- and can
			only assume they've crash-landed
			on Vagra Two. Main Engineering
			is working at top speed to return
			us to warp power.
			Forget the final check.
			Computer -- initiate start-up
			sequence.
			Beginning check list.
			Override. We are going directly
			to start-up.
			That procedure is not recommended.
			Understood. Now. Prime
			matter/antimatter injectors. Set
			ratio at twenty-five to one...
			Ratio set.
			Power engine core. Inject
			reactants.
			Captain, this is Lieutenant
			Commander Leland T. Lynch. You
			have minimum warp drive.
			Computer indicates alignment of
			matter-anti-matter completed, sir.
			Course plotted and set for Vagra
			Two.
			Warp eight.
			Minimum warp drive, Captain.
			You heard the order. Make it so.
			Approaching Vagra Two.
			Strange, sir. No emergency
			signal from the shuttle as yet.
			They're designed to withstand
			almost any impact.
			Beginning a deeper probe, sir.
			What is this place, Mister Data?
			There is no information in the
			library computer, sir, other than
			the fact of its existence. No
			signs of any known higher life-form.
			Virtually no vegetation.
			Atmosphere?
			Minimum for our needs.
			Standard orbit.
			Standard orbit, aye.
			I could have set up the rendezvous
			in a dozen alternate sites.
			She means a lot to all of us.
			She's not dead. I'd know it.
			I've located the shuttle!
			Life signs?
			Not yet, sir.
			Still probing. It appears to be
			buried under a lot of debris.
			I may have something, sir!
			Faint life signs. Very faint.
			How many?
			There's no way of telling from
			here.
			Can we beam up the injured?
			No. Our sensors are not fully
			penetrating whatever the debris
			is, sir. I cannot explain it.
			That's very unusual.
			Yes. I cannot explain it.
			Captain, this is Lieutenant
			Commander Leland T. Lynch. Can
			I shut down the warp drive now
			for a full realignment?
			Yes.
			Thanks. That's fine...
			No. Wait.
			Not yet.
			You'll have full impulse.
			I understand, but for the moment
			I want all systems at full
			readiness -- especially propulsion.
			As you wish, Captain.
			Assemble your team, Number One.
			Right away.
			I'll meet you in Transporter Room
			Four.
			Yar, Data.
			Do it.
			Ben must have had no control
			left, otherwise he would have
			picked a better spot.
			Let's go. The life signs are
			weak.
			What is it?
			No idea. We'll go around. Just
			to be on the safe side.
			We'll go the other way.
			Enterprise, this is Riker. We've
			got a problem.
			What kind of a problem, Number
			One?
			I'm not sure yet. There's some
			kind of a slick blocking our
			path. We'll keep you apprised.
			Maintain an open frequency.
			Aye, sir.
			Analysis, Mister Data.
			Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell
			you what it is -- only what it is
			not.
			Explain.
			There is no evidence of neural
			or circulatory systems. No
			internal organs. Cellular
			structure unknown. It does not
			have any proteins which are known
			to us.
			It's narrower over here. Can
			we get over it?
			Wait, Beverly. How is it moving,
			Data?
			I do not know, sir. It does not
			appear to have any skeletal
			framework or musculature.
			Then what's causing it to move?
			Perhaps we are. It appears to
			be following us, sir.
			No readings of intelligence.
			No brain as we know it. But
			evidence of thought, Mister Data?
			Insufficient information.
			Number One, can you beam around
			it?
			Negative, not enough room, sir.
			It seems to be trying to keep
			us away from the shuttle.
			Data, is it alive?
			It is possible. It possesses
			two of the requisites for life.
			Very good, tin man.
			What is it, Number One? What are
			you seeing?
			I wish I had an answer, Captain.
			The truth is... I'm not sure.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			While on the planet Vagra Two to
			rescue members of the crew who
			were injured in a rather strange
			and unexplained shuttle crash,
			the away team, lead by Commander
			Riker, has encountered a strange
			creature which seems to be able
			to take many forms, including
			something which is humanoid.
			Go easy, Number One. Let's find
			out what it is we are dealing with
			here.
			Agreed, Captain.
			And Number One, I don't believe
			the location shuttle crash and
			the proximity of this creature
			is necessarily a coincidence.
			I am Commander William Riker of
			the USS Enterprise.
			I am ARMUS. Why do you intrude
			into my space?
			We mean you no harm. We have an
			injured crew in that shuttlecraft.
			We need to get to them. May we
			pass?
			That is important to you? That
			they live?
			Yes. Preserving life -- all life
			-- is very important to us.
			Why?
			We believe that everything in the
			universe has a right to exist.
			Interesting. Irrelevant. But
			you may now leave if you wish.
			We won't without the shuttle
			crew.
			You will not like it here.
			What are you saying -- that you
			are going to try and deny us
			access and attempt to force us
			to leave without our comrades?
			I told you what you can do. You
			can leave.
			Enough. We have people who need
			attention. We mean you no harm,
			but do not interfere.
			Number One?
			The creature attacked us.
			Lieutenant Yar is down.
			It appears to feed on our phaser
			energy.
			We have no effect on it.
			Transporter Room. Get them up.
			Now!
			She's dead.
			I need her in Sickbay right now!
			Get a gurney.
			Yellow Alert, Lieutenant Worf.
			I'll be in Sickbay.
			Status, Doctor?
			She's dead.
			Bring her back.
			I'm trying.
			You've saved people before. You
			can save her.
			Neural stimulator.
			There. You did it.
			No. I've got her on total
			support. There's no independent
			brain activity.
			She's not responding, Doctor.
			Her synaptic network is breaking
			down.
			No! Inject norep.
			We're going for direct reticular
			stimulation.
			Risky.
			What does that mean?
			Doesn't matter! Do it!
			She moved!
			Neurons are beginning to
			depolarize.
			Increase to seventy microvolts.
			Doctor?
			Eighty-five microvolts.
			She's gone.
			Gone?
			There's too much synaptic damage.
			That thing just sucked all the
			life out of her. There's nothing
			I can do...
			Your friends have deserted you.
			They're not coming back.
			You're wrong.
			I killed one of them.
			Yes. I know.
			How could you be in there and know
			that?
			I felt her die.
			Do you want to know why I killed
			her?
			Meaningless. That act had no
			reason.
			Exactly. I did it because I
			could.
			But you felt no satisfaction.
			No, none. It was too easy.
			You wanted her to suffer. You
			have a great need.
			I need nothing.
			Liar.
			End this. Let us go.
			Not yet.
			They won't give you what you want.
			And what is that?
			To break their spirit.
			Oh, is that what I want?... Then
			that's what I will have.
			Never.
			She didn't do anything, Captain.
			Her phaser was lowered. She only
			wanted to get to Troi and
			Lieutenant Prieto.
			There was nothing provocative
			about what she did.
			It just killed her. No reason.
			No justification. A senseless,
			brutal act.
			All right. This is very emotional
			for all of us, but we still have
			members of this crew down on that
			planet, so, until the shuttle
			crew is safely aboard this ship,
			our feelings will have to wait.
			Lieutenant Worf, you are now chief
			of security.
			I will do my best, sir.
			Doctor, what is the status of
			the shuttle crew?
			We're still receiving faint life
			signs. But the sensor readings
			are fluctuating -- and I don't
			know how accurate they are.
			ARMUS is capable of creating
			undefined forcefields. In
			effect, we are powerless to
			communicate or use our transporter
			unless it allows us to.
			A powerful creature against whom
			we seem to have no defense.
			Number One.
			This creature that calls itself
			ARMUS is down on that planet
			waiting for us to come back. It
			wants us to come back. It killed
			Tasha. It could have just as
			easily killed us all. It didn't.
			Troi and Ben Prieto are still
			alive. For a reason. It wants
			something -- and it knows we will
			not leave so long as Troi and Ben
			are alive.
			What does it want?
			The only way we're going to find
			out is to go back down.
			Sir, request permission to
			accompany Commander Riker. He
			may need help -- and ARMUS may
			allow us through its forcefield
			only once.
			I am going too. There are
			injured people down there.
			Captain, perhaps I can see
			something in the creature which
			will be helpful.
			Worf -- are you coming?
			I will remain on the ship.
			The object here is not to engage
			this creature in battle. The goal
			is the safe return of Counselor
			Troi and Lieutenant Prieto. I
			can best accomplish this from the
			Tactical Station.
			Agreed, Lieutenant... Number One,
			I see no other choice. Prepare
			your away team.
			Is there anything left to say?
			Energize.
			Enterprise.
			Number One.
			We're approaching the
			shuttlecraft. The creature's
			covering it.
			I lied to you. They came back.
			Let me talk with them.
			No.
			Why not? Does the thought of
			my having contact with them make
			you uneasy?
			No, it makes them uneasy. They
			are worried.
			Yes. Yes, they are worried.
			They care for you. You must be
			very special.
			We are members of a community.
			We all care for one another.
			Equally? None more than another?
			Yes, equally.
			Now it is you who lie. There is
			one who is loved more.
			You were really surprised that
			they came back.
			Yes.
			Why? Because the others did not?
			What others?
			You can't hide the emptiness from
			me. The others. The ones who
			hurt you. Who left you -- alone --
			rejected. The ones who make you
			so angry.
			What do you know of them?
			Only what you tell me.
			Enterprise, Armus is moving
			towards us.
			Captain. Look at this.
			The force of the energy field
			around the shuttle just took a
			dip. It was almost low enough
			for us to beam them out. Now,
			as the creature approaches the
			away team, the energy field
			increases.
			Chart it.
			She said you'd be back, but I
			didn't think so.
			We have no choice.
			I sense anger directed at me.
			I'm here to negotiate. What is
			it you want?
			Maybe I want nothing.
			Then you would have killed us
			all.
			I still might.
			Do you want something? Tell me.
			Maybe we can reach an
			accommodation.
			You would do that even after what
			I did to the fair one?
			Yes.
			If I tell you what it is... will
			you give it to me?
			I don't know... I guess it
			depends.
			Not good enough.
			I'm a doctor. I need to treat
			our injured friends.
			Say please.
			Please.
			Again.
			Please.
			You ask nicely. I will allow it.
			Stop! Only the "Doctor."
			Stop. I've changed my mind. Talk
			to her from here.
			How?
			Troi, can you hear me? Troi?
			Deanna? Are you all right?
			Beverly...
			Are you all right?
			I'm not sure. Ben's really bad
			-- I can barely feel his pulse.
			We have to get you out. It has
			a forcefield preventing us from
			transporting you.
			I know.
			She needs our help.
			You have no permission to pass.
			There are people suffering a few
			meters away, and you block our
			path. Why?
			You asked to talk. I allowed it.
			Wasn't that enough for you?
			No. I need help to get to them.
			You are ungrateful.
			You are evil and disgusting. What
			are you made of?
			It does not register on my
			tricorder, Doctor.
			"It?" Does that mean I am not
			alive?
			No. Clearly you are some kind
			of intelligent form.
			Then your instrument lies. It
			is useless. Perhaps all your
			instruments are useless.
			Don't help him.
			One meter to your left, Geordi.
			Behind you.
			Aren't you going to lead him to
			his sight again, robot?
			No. You will just move it again.
			I will not help you hurt him.
			None of us will help you.
			Then give it to him. I will find
			something else to do. Wait right
			here.
			You said I wouldn't enjoy it.
			You were wrong.
			Still the great emptiness remains.
			You sound so alone.
			I am alone. I am the discarded
			skin of a creature whose beauty
			dazzles all who see it. But I
			am its refuse -- left here.
			You have my pity.
			Your pity! Save that for
			yourself.
			Touch him and he dies.
			Enterprise, ARMUS has enveloped
			and attacked Commander Riker.
			I'm beaming you up!
			If any of you leave now, he dies.
			And so do the survivors of the
			crash.
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			There is grave danger to the crew
			on Vagra Two. My first officer
			is missing - attacked by this
			entity known as "ARMUS."
			Captain, perhaps you should look
			at this.
			We have a chart of the energy
			field surrounding the shuttle.
			There are a great deal of
			fluctuations.
			Yes - but there is a pattern.
			Here is when it killed Lieutenant
			Yar, and here is when it absorbed
			Commander Riker.
			And here -- and here? Where the
			energy is lowest?
			Both times it had enveloped the
			shuttle and was involved with
			Counselor Troi.
			So when it is provoked in a
			certain way its forcefield is
			weakened... Troi must have the
			answer. I'm beaming down. You
			have the Conn, Lieutenant.
			Sir, I'd like to...
			... Go with me? No, Wesley. You
			can be of more help to Lieutenant
			Worf.
			But...
			...No.
			Tell my Mom... I'm not worried.
			I'll tell her, Wes.
			Imzadi. No... Stop hurting him!
			What will you give me if I stop
			hurting him?
			Nothing. I can give you nothing.
			You still resist. Not for much
			longer.
			Ah. Another human has arrived.
			A very bold one, too. Perhaps
			the party is complete.
			You must be the chief.
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise. Is Commander Riker
			dead?
			Guess.
			I would guess that death is no
			longer sufficient entertainment
			to alleviate its boredom.
			Therefore, Commander Riker is
			alive.
			Maybe.
			Don't you want to ask me what I
			want?
			No.
			Then, to protect your own
			existence, maybe you'd better give
			me a reason. Entertain me. Be
			creative. Then perhaps I won't
			kill your assistant. You do care
			very much about that, don't you?
			Yes.
			Robot, how would you feel if you
			were the instrument of death for
			your leader?
			Don't struggle, Mister Data.
			I have no control over what you
			do with the phaser. Therefore,
			I would not be the instrument of
			his death.
			Perhaps the kind doctor would
			engender more feeling?
			How does it feel facing your own
			extinction? I won't call it
			death. You're not alive.
			It feels -- curious.
			You are capable of great sadism
			and cruelty. Interesting. No
			redeeming qualities.
			So what do you think?
			I think you should be destroyed.
			A moral judgment from something
			that isn't even alive?
			Mister Data...
			ARMUS, we are through dealing with
			you.
			I have your man in here... and
			the others.
			It doesn't matter. We will no
			longer amuse you.
			I can kill them.
			Yes. You can. But only I can
			make them perform. They follow
			my orders.
			Then it is you. Amuse me.
			Not until I know if the ones in
			the shuttle are still alive. I
			must see them.
			Not possible.
			Then our business is complete.
			And you claim you care about your
			comrades.
			I do care.
			Shall I tell you what true evil
			is? It is to submit to you. It
			is when we surrender our freedom,
			our dignity instead of defying
			you. Do what you will. We will
			take the consequences.
			Wait!
			He's alive.
			But is he all right?
			Don't move.
			Everything shows normal, except
			his skin sustained a mild form
			of acid bath.
			So much distortion, so
			frustrated... it had to get rid
			of me.
			I want you all out of here.
			Enterprise, beam up the away team --
			immediately.
			You need my permission.
			Do I have it?
			Yes. Are you going?
			No. Not yet.
			Enterprise, four to beam up.
			Aye, sir.
			I want to see my people on the
			shuttle.
			Troi.
			Captain Picard.
			We registered a weakening of
			ARMUS' energy while he was talking
			to you. What was going on?
			ARMUS is very needy, but he can't
			deal with that. He denies his
			rage. I confronted him with it.
			That must have been when he
			reacted.
			Lieutenant Worf, I'm going to
			try and break this impasse.
			Monitor carefully.
			Aye sir.
			Set the computer. When the energy
			level reaches two point six point
			two-oh-five, automatically beam
			up Troi and Prieto. We'll do a
			parallel transport of the
			captain.
			How long have you been on this
			planet?
			Since they left.
			Someone was here before?
			Long ago.
			They abandoned you. Who were
			they?
			A race of titans. So they
			thought. Together, they perfected
			a method of bringing to the
			surface all that was evil and
			negative within them. All this
			erupted on the outside, spread,
			and connected. In time, it formed
			a second skin, dank and vile.
			They found a way to rid themselves
			of it, leaving them free of the
			bonds of destructiveness. Then
			they left. And here I am.
			It must be very lonely.
			You cannot trick me by pretending
			compassion, captain.
			Haven't you seen we humans are
			capable of compassion?
			Oh, yes. It is revolting. Time
			and again you rise from despair
			into hope. From hate into
			understanding. From aloneness
			into love. But you are puny.
			Weak. Vessels that die from a
			flick of my power.
			But our spirit soars. A great
			poet once said "all spirits are
			enslaved which serve things evil."
			Picard, it is impossible for you
			to accept that I am truly evil.
			Because you are not.
			I am a skin of evil.
			Nothing in the universe is the
			same as anything else -- but
			everything has light and dark.
			They did not leave you because
			they hated you. They didn't
			understand you.
			You don't know that.
			Energy shields are way down!
			Computer is beginning transport.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			shuttlecraft has been destroyed
			to prevent any possibility of
			Armus leaving the planet. Vagra
			2 has been declared an off-limits
			planet, but the damage has been
			done. One of the saddest duties
			I have to perform is ahead of me.
			This is where you're supposed to
			sit.
			Why?
			I don't know. The captain gave
			me a seating plan.
			We are here together to honor our
			friend and comrade Lieutenant
			Natasha Yar. We will have much
			time to grieve for her in the days
			ahead, but for now, she has asked
			that we celebrate her life -- with
			her. She has left a living will.
			Welcome, my friends. You are here
			now watching this image of me
			because I have died. It probably
			happened while I was on duty, and
			quickly, which is what I expected,
			and what I wanted. Never forget
			I died doing exactly what I chose
			to do.
			What I want you to know is how
			much I loved my life... and each
			of you who shared it with me.
			You are my "family."
			Whoever I was before Starfleet,
			where I came from, isn't
			important. I have been blessed
			with your friendship and your
			love.
			Will Riker, you are the best.
			From the moment you beamed on
			board, you never failed me. You
			trusted me, you encouraged me
			and most of all, you made me
			laugh.
			Deanna... you are capable of so
			much love, you taught me without
			ever having to say a word. I
			realized I could be feminine
			without losing anything --
			something I never thought I could
			achieve.
			Ah, Worf. I hope for your sake
			I met death with my eyes open.
			We are so much alike, you and
			I, both warriors, orphans who
			found ourselves this family.
			My friend, Beverly. True to
			yourself, your ideals. Your
			fierce devotion comes from within.
			It can't be diminished. From
			you I have learned to strive for
			excellence, no matter what the
			personal cost.
			Wesley, I'm sorry that I won't
			be able to see you grow into the
			exceptional man you'll be. But
			I have my vision of who you are
			and your kindness and innocence
			is ageless.
			Geordi, in those moments I felt
			the most despair, you took my hand
			and made everything better. Your
			innate joy taught me to look
			beyond the moment.
			Mister Data. Android...
			automaton... robot.
			No. You see things with the
			wonder of a child, and that makes
			you more human than any of us.
			I love you just the way you are.
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I can't
			say you've been like a father to
			me, because I never had one and
			I don't know what it feels like.
			But if I could choose someone in
			this universe to be like, someone
			who I would want to make proud
			of me, it's you. You who have
			the heart of an explorer and the
			soul of a poet. So you will
			understand when I say "Death is
			that state in which one exists
			only in the memory of others...
			which is why it is not an end."
			No good-byes. Just "au revoir,"
			my friends.
			Au revoir, Natasha.
			The service is concluded.
			Sir, the purpose of this gathering
			has eluded me.
			Oh? How so?
			My thoughts are not for Tasha,
			but for myself. I keep thinking
			how empty it will feel without
			her presence. I missed the point.
			No, you didn't, Data. You got
			it.
