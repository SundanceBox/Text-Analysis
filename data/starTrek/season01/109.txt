			Captain's log, stardate 41255.6.
			After delivering a party of Earth
			colonists to the Strnad solar
			system and providing...
			... them with all their basic
			necessities, we have discovered
			another Class M planet in the
			adjoining Rubicun star system.
			We are now in orbit there, having
			determined it to be inhabited as
			well as unusually lovely. It
			is...
			... a pastoral world, which also
			shows evidence of learning and
			civilization. My first officer
			has taken an away team down to
			make contact and they are in the
			process of returning to the ship.
			Riker has sounded very enthused
			in his reports.
			He says the planet has life forms
			almost identical to us.
			Captain... !
			Sorry, Troi.
			The Doctor has something much more
			important on her mind, Captain.
			Please, Troi, do not pick up my
			feelings!
			Your feelings? All we need
			are ears.
			You've been talking about it for
			days now... Shore leave for the
			crew.
			I'm tired myself.
			Establishing that colony has
			exhausted the entire crew, sir.
			We're not a supply vessel.
			Settling all those people was a
			strain on everyone.
			Is it as good as your reports,
			Number One?
			Exactly per my reports, sir.
			Class M, so Earthlike, so
			beautiful, it will startle you!
			It sounds wonderful for the
			children!
			The Holodecks are marvelous, of
			course, but nothing like giving
			them open space and fresh air...
			I've listed my report on their
			customs and laws, sir. Fairly
			simple, common sense things.
			Wild in some ways, puritanical
			in others. Neat as pins,
			ultra-lawful, and making love at
			the drop of a hat.
			Any hat.
			But even the happiest report has
			its negatives. Let's start with
			them.
			There are none, sir. Not that
			any of us can find.
			But there is a problem here, sir!
			I do not understand this at all!
			It's the faulty reading I
			reported, sir.
			Sensor technicians are working
			on it, sir. They've identified
			it as a "glitch" in the system.
			I take it you find no "glitch"
			at all in this planet, however.
			If you approve shore leave, sir,
			we could start with a small group
			at first.
			Of course...
			Wesley, if we go, you will join
			the away team to evaluate this
			world as a place for young people
			to relax.
			Yes, sir!
			If all scans and observations
			confirm the reports...
			... certainly I'll approve it.
			Let's hope it is not too good
			to be true.
			We are in orbit of a planet
			designated Rubicun Three... and
			have found it to be the home of
			a life form who call themselves
			the Edo.
			Careful, sir...
			It's all right, Lieutenant, these
			are the Edo we met.
			They certainly are... fit, right?
			They certainly are.
			Health and happiness!
			A pleasant day to you!
			You did return as promised!
			Rivan, Liator...
			Also from our vessel is Troi...
			Slowly, slowly...
			I must also welcome this lovely
			one...
			... and this lovely one...
			My pleasure.
			Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel
			mainly happiness and friendship.
			And I welcome this huge one...
			... oh, yes, yes...
			Nice planet!
			But you are a young one. I do
			not know your custom regarding
			love.
			Uh... I guess... whatever you
			usually do...
			Others would like to visit here
			too. If you'll tell us what
			limits you'd place on the
			number...
			Whatever pleases you. We can
			discuss it at the Council
			Chambers.
			Shall we go there now or remain
			and play?
			Play?
			At love. Unless you don't enjoy
			that.
			Perhaps you do?
			And you? Yes, I can see that you
			do.
			Listen, maybe I'll just go on
			ahead...
			This is unfair to him.
			We'll go to the Council Chambers.
			You'll find young people your age
			there.
			Well... I really can't make any
			promises...
			You don't have to. Our rules are
			simple. No one does anything
			uncomfortable to them.
			Come! Our people will want to
			know you.
			Rivan, perhaps they...can't...run.
			Can't run? Sure we can run, right
			sir?
			That's the custom here, running...
			Right! Lead the way!
			"When in Rome... ," eh?
			When where, sir?
			Good health to you!
			Happiness to you!
			It's like an "Eden" here.
			Good health! I thought you might
			be out of breath.
			Children, we've brought you a new
			friend!
			Hello! Join us!
			Yes, please!
			We may surprise you in a lot of
			ways.
			Everyone! We've brought the
			visitors!
			Please enjoy what we have!
			I have traced it through all sensor
			channels, Captain! It is not a
			glitch... !
			... or any other form of error or
			malfunction, sir.
			Confirmed by my readings, sir.
			It's like a "shadow something"...
			Exactly! As if it's not entirely
			in or out of our dimension.
			"What" is, Commander?
			Whatever is sitting out there
			without triggering our alarm
			relays, Captain.
			Center Main Viewer on that area.
			I need more, Commander.
			Permission to go to hailing
			frequencies, sir?
			Hailing frequencies open. On all
			frequencies and language forms,
			send...
			Enterprise to Object off our
			starboard bow. Request that you
			identify yourself!
			Shields and deflectors up full,
			sir. Main phaser banks ready.
			Hailing frequencies? Any reply?
			It was something unintelligible,
			Captain. Now running it through
			our logic and language circuits...
			Have a real look at it, Geordi!
			Aye, sir.
			Sir, my sensors read it... well,
			as "half there." And it does
			look...
			As if it's partly...transparent.
			Data, what the hell is it?
			Lieutenant La Forge to Captain.
			Go ahead, La Forge. What can you
			make out?
			This is something I've never
			seen before, sir.
			It's as if it isn't entirely in
			our dimension, sir.
			Anything else?
			Negative, sir. It's something
			I don't understand.
			I have some information on its
			first transmission, sir. It
			translates as...
			... "stand by."
			Sir! Sensors show something
			emerging from that... that ship,
			if you want to call it that.
			Verified. Something very small...
			Getting smaller...
			Intruder alert, sir! But I
			don't...
			... show a location...
			Why a tiny swirl of light,
			Lieutenant? Could you make out
			anything else?
			No, sir. Perhaps it is meant to
			seem "non-threatening" to us.
			The away team signal has been cut
			off, Captain! We are no longer
			in contact with our people!
			Intruder relays do show
			something...
			Why has everything become a
			something, or a whatever?
			STATE THE PURPOSE...
			STATE...
			STATE THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE
			DONE!
			I am Captain Picard, commanding
			this Federation starship...
			STATE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT
			HERE!
			We have sent down what we call an
			away team to make peaceful contact
			with...
			DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE LIFE FORMS
			HERE?
			No... we are merely visiting
			here...
			BUT YOU DID MORE AT THE WORLD
			YOU JUST LEFT. WHY HAVE YOU LEFT
			YOUR OWN LIFE FORMS THERE?
			The colony we just planted, sir...
			We found that world uninhabited.
			The life forms we left there...
			... had sought the challenge...
			... at least that's the basic
			reason... had sought the challenge
			of creating a new lifestyle,
			a new society there.
			All life on our world is driven
			to... to protect its own form by
			re-seeding itself as... as widely
			as possible.
			DO NOT INTERFERE WITH MY CHILDREN
			BELOW!
			Captain... I do not understand how,
			but it is asking me if I was...
			constructed for information
			exchanges.
			If there... is any way of our
			learning more about whatever is
			out there, Data...
			Watch! You can't do this!
			I want to do something too! With
			you.
			Uh... What?
			Something you can teach me. Will
			you?
			Well, actually, there are some
			games I... uh, don't quite know
			yet...
			It's playing ball. Will you teach
			me?
			Oh, sure. If you have a bat for
			the ball, I'll show you my
			favorite.
			A bat...
			... a stick or branch, about this
			thick, this long...
			We can get it from the gardens.
			Enterprise, come in.
			Captain, do you read me?
			Let's... it may be nothing, but
			let's move our people together.
			Including the boy, Wesley? He's
			outside...
			Is there some problem?
			We've lost contact with our ship.
			It's nothing these people have
			done... I'm certain of that. Their
			minds are so open...
			Help me locate Wes. He's wandered
			somewhere.
			If I can take a moment of your
			time, Lieutenant...
			Yes, Worf... but you've got to hear
			this.
			Are you telling me that there's
			no crime here whatsoever? No one
			breaks any laws?
			Once they did. Long, long ago
			there was much disorder.
			But not now.
			But I've seen no sign of... of
			police... those who enforce laws.
			We have very few. They're called
			"Mediators." And they are needed
			only in one place each day...
			The "punishment zone." An area
			that's selected for a period of
			time.
			It's a completely random selection?
			No one but our Mediators know what
			place or for how long. We're very
			proud of the wisdom of our
			ancestors. No person ever knows
			where or when a zone will be.
			... and so no one risks death.
			Death?
			... by breaking any law.
			Wait, let's explain this...
			Only one punishment for any
			crime.
			Anyone who commits any crime in
			the punishment zone dies!
			The law is the law. Our peace
			is built on that.
			Even a small thing? Such as
			ignoring a rule like "keep off
			the grass?"
			Then no one breaks that rule.
			Who wants to risk execution?
			There's always a white wall or
			fence to remind anyone of a
			forbidden area like that...
			And just who tells visitors of
			those rules?
			We'd better find Wesley!
			You're very clever at this!
			At home we play a lot of it.
			Here, toss the ball ahead of me!
			No, Wes...
			No! It's forbidden to disturb
			the new plants... !
			Couldn't you see the fence?
			That's for new plants...
			Don't ever go past a white
			marker!
			What's wrong?
			Oh, no! Oh, please, no!
			Speak the truth. We are
			Mediators.
			I said I was fine. Just some
			splinters...
			He doesn't know; he's from another
			place.
			How very sad. But this zone has
			been selected.
			He doesn't understand!
			It's always sad... now doubly so.
			What's happening here?
			I was chasing a ball...
			... and fell into that. I'm
			really sorry!
			You admit you did that? Freely?
			I'm with Starfleet. We don't
			lie.
			It won't happen again. We
			apologize.
			We're sorry, too. But that
			changes nothing.
			Careful, Commander, they've got
			some strange laws here...
			I thought you reviewed the laws
			here.
			But they list nothing about
			punishment. That's what all this
			is about.
			One moment, please...
			Is there a witness to this
			transgression?
			But it was my fault; I threw the
			ball past him...
			We have a visible transgression,
			ample witnesses, and an admission
			of guilt...
			... and it deeply pains us to do
			what we must. Are you prepared
			for punishment?
			Please?
			Punishment? If you mean what the
			others were talking about...
			What kind of punishment? Name
			it!
			Death, of course! Don't make
			it...
			... difficult for the boy...
			Drop that; drop it now!
			It's a kind of syringe...
			What is this? You said "death;"
			is it "poison?"
			But... but of course it is!
			Completely painless; the boy would
			have felt nothing...
			But look at him now. You've
			frightened him!
			He was going to kill me?
			And if this Zone were still in
			effect, you would all deserve
			death.
			It was announced you came as
			friends. Is this how friends act?
			Enterprise from away team, come
			in.
			Are you receiving us, Enterprise?
			Urgent, Enterprise. Please
			respond!
			Condition?
			No sign of consciousness, but the
			balance of the readings are quite
			normal for him.
			I believe this is some form of
			information exchange with whatever
			is over there. At least, I hope
			that's it.
			Any communication from our away
			team?
			Something is blocking
			communication both...
			... Security, urgent. Repeating,
			Enterprise from away team...
			This is the Enterprise,
			Lieutenant. We're receiving you
			now.
			This is an urgent call for Captain
			Picard.
			We may need your presence here,
			Captain. We have serious trouble
			with... with a member of our away
			team and an unusual law they have
			here...
			Captain to Riker, stand by.
			Signs of consciousness?
			None yet. Perhaps in minutes,
			hours... I don't yet know what's
			happened to him.
			Take him to Sickbay; call me the
			instant he's awake.
			Anything new on that... that thing
			out there?
			Negative, sir.
			Captain to first officer. I'm
			beaming down.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			have encountered a strange
			vessel-like object, one with
			frightening power, which appears
			to exist partly in another
			dimension. On the world below...
			... what began as a shore leave
			opportunity among delightful
			inhabitants of a lovely Earthlike
			planet... has led incredibly to
			a death sentence...
			... a death sentence proclaimed
			against... one of our crew members
			for what our world considers a
			petty, non-criminal infraction.
			How can I allow a crew member
			to die for that?
			How does the Prime Directive apply
			to this case? Indeed if we do
			save our crewmember, how will the
			frightening object up here react
			to that?
			Care to comment privately how you
			read any of this...
			Unnecessary, sir.
			I get strong feelings that they
			are honest almost to a fault.
			But they do have great respect,
			even pride, in their own ways.
			Welcome to our world, Captain.
			We regret that our system of
			justice is troubling you.
			Wesley Crusher -- where is he?
			In accord with the Prime
			Directive, Captain, I've let them
			hold him pending the outcome of
			this.
			He is safe and unharmed. We
			promise that.
			Captain Picard... I do not know
			how you Earth people conduct law
			and justice; even if you respect
			such things...
			We do.
			Good, so do we. Our precepts have
			been handed down from long ago.
			The tranquility you see in our
			lives has been made possible by
			our laws...
			We are a people of law. They do
			sometimes bring us sadness, but
			we have learned to adjust to that.
			Perhaps your laws work as well...
			They haven't always, but they do
			now.
			Do you execute criminals?
			No... not any longer, that is.
			You did once?
			Unfortunately, yes. But since
			then...
			And when you did, was it believed
			necessary to do so?
			Can we please get to the facts
			concerning our crewmember?
			Yes, some people then felt it was
			necessary. But we've learned how
			to detect the seeds of criminal
			behavior... Capital punishment
			is no longer justified in our
			world as a deterrent.
			But you once believed execution
			necessary.
			So, we are not yet as "advanced"
			as they are.
			And since you are "advanced" in
			other ways too, I suggest you use
			the, ah, transfer device...
			"Beam... "
			... the "beam" device to permit
			the Wesley boy to escape from us.
			We will record him as a convicted-criminal
			out of our reach...
			... an "advanced" person who
			luckily escaped the barbarism of
			this backward little world.
			Unfortunately, we have a law
			ourselves known as the Prime
			Directive...
			Riker has explained it to us...
			Is the boy in the slightest danger
			from you right now?
			Until sundown?
			Because you are strangers, we are
			delaying enforcement of the law.
			But we must act by the time of
			sundown.
			Then, I have another question now,
			please. While orbiting... while
			circling high above your world
			as we do... we encountered a
			strange object, a "vessel"
			perhaps? Do you know of such a
			thing? It was... well, you could
			say not entirely real, at least
			not completely what you might call
			solid...
			Do you mean God?
			God?
			God is said to be somewhere up
			there. Protecting us.
			Exactly... exactly how would you
			describe "God?"
			As you just did. As existing
			both here and in another place
			also.
			But when God wants to show its
			power, it can make itself felt
			most fully.
			We know.
			Picard here.
			CMO Crusher here, sir. Commander
			Data has just regained
			consciousness.
			What condition? Can he talk?
			He is insisting on it, sir.
			Urgently.
			Stand by; Picard out.
			I'd rather explain about her son
			to her personally.
			You promise Wesley Crusher will
			be safe until sundown?
			You have our word.
			Then, will one of you return with
			me to our vessel?
			Of course. I'll go as a hostage
			for the boy's safety.
			No, that's not it. I want you
			to... identify something for me,
			if you can.
			Captain to Transporter Room.
			Stand by for three to beam up...
			I'm...frightened...
			No reason to be.
			Transporter Room, energize.
			But this is a ... a city. A great
			city!
			Captain, I've just seen the away
			team report about Wesley...
			In a moment, Doctor...
			"In a moment... "
			Exactly, Doctor, in a moment.
			You were about to say... ?
			Since you have all this power,
			why be concerned about our laws?
			You could take the boy from us!
			It's not that simple.
			From here we can view whatever's
			outside our vessel.
			Do you mean my world?! You said
			we'd be high above it...
			And something else that's up here
			circling your world too. It's
			very important to us... perhaps
			to you... to know what it is.
			I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was
			necessary. Do you know what that
			is?
			Can you tell us what it is?
			Is it "God?"
			Now, it's very important you
			answer something. How do you
			recognize what it is?
			Nothing will harm you, I promise!
			Just tell us how you recognize
			it.
			It... has appeared...before. It
			is... the same.
			Can you speak to it... Does it
			speak to you?
			Captain... !
			RETURN MY CHILD!
			"Return... ?"
			It's coming toward us, sir... !
			Picard to Transporter Room,
			urgent!
			Yes, do that! But hurry... !
			It is still coming toward us...
			Transporter Chief to Captain...
			One to beam down to away team
			location. Hurry!
			Engage, Transporter Room, urgent!
			Engag...
			What do you intend to do about
			my son?
			He is being held safely, until
			sundown...
			When he faces execution! Although
			he has committed no crime,
			certainly none that any sane and
			reasonable person would...
			I... apologize, sir... but this is
			very difficult for me...
			You saw what that thing was about
			to do. I have a ship, an entire
			crew to consider...
			If you felt the same, you'd be
			as frightened and trembling...
			But I am.
			Data is in Sickbay here. You'll
			find him able to talk.
			He's checking out fine, Doctor.
			Finish it later, please.
			I was an excellent choice for
			them, Captain. They could
			communicate with me quite...
			... I was about to say quite
			"easily," but there was nothing
			"easy" about it. Fortunately,
			they stopped short of overloading
			my circuitry...
			You're saying they. It is a
			vessel of some sort...
			Definitely not a single "entity"
			if that's what you mean, sir...
			although they know the Edo worship
			them as a "God thing."
			They know... ?
			They recognize that this is quite
			expected and harmless at the
			present Edo stage of evolution,
			and...
			What kind of vessel?
			It is perhaps not what we'd
			understand as a "vessel," sir.
			The dimensions this one occupies
			allows them to... well, to be in
			several places at once. But they
			consider this entire star cluster
			to be theirs, and it was probably
			unwise of us to attempt to place
			a human colony in this area.
			Of course, there are three
			thousand four other planets in
			this general star cluster in
			which we...
			Data, don't babble!
			"Babble," sir? I am not aware
			that I ever babble, sir. It may
			be that from time to time I have
			considerable information to
			communicate, and you may question
			the way I organize it...
			Please "organize" it into brief
			answers to my questions. Do they
			accept our presence at this
			planet?
			Not yet decided, sir.
			Please feel free to volunteer any
			important information, however.
			I volunteer that they are now
			observing us, sir.
			To judge what kind of life forms
			we are?
			No, it is more curiosity, sir.
			I doubt they expect us to abide
			by their value systems.
			Do they... know of our Prime
			Directive?
			They know everything I know, sir.
			And, in your opinion, if we
			violated the Prime Directive.. ?
			That's not a fair question at...
			Continue.
			That would be a case of judging
			us by our own rules, sir. If we
			violate our own Prime Directive,
			they might consider us deceitful
			and untrustworthy.
			You do recall, sir, they cautioned
			us not to interfere with their
			"children" below.
			What has happened?
			The Edo want to execute my son.
			I will not allow that to happen,
			Jean-Luc!
			Most interesting, sir. The
			emotion of motherhood, compared
			to all others felt by humans...
			SHUT UP!
			You were right, sir. I do tend
			to babble.
			Captain's log, stardate 41255.9.
			Whatever the object or vessel in
			orbit with us, it hangs there like
			a "nemesis". It is one thing
			to communicate with something
			mysterious...
			... but it is quite another to be
			silently observed by it. I am
			concerned whether it understands
			the same concept of reason that
			we do?
			You sent for me, sir?
			Let's talk some more, Data.
			Yes sir. What level of
			communication?
			Any. My apologies for saying you
			babbled.
			But I do, sir.
			It was wise to beam back the Edo
			woman.
			Barely in time.
			The Edo's "God" is very protective
			of its children.
			There was no choice but to
			learn...
			... what we could about that thing
			from her.
			Apparently the Edo people had seen
			it before, from time to time, sir.
			But I'm sorry I had to. She was
			so frightened.
			Understandable. To share an orbit
			with "God" is no small experience.
			You have a facility for seeing
			things not in the way we do, but
			as they truly are.
			I need help, my friend. I cannot
			let Wesley or any member of this
			vessel be sacrificed this way.
			The Prime Directive does not
			really intend that.
			The problem, sir, is there!
			Although they have learned of the
			Prime Directive from my mind, how
			will they evaluate it? How do
			they reason? What are their
			values? Remember its warning
			to us, sir.
			Exactly. How do I explain not
			obeying the laws down there, not
			permitting young Crusher's
			execution? Does that endanger
			this ship and over a thousand
			other lives?
			Would you choose one life over
			one thousand, sir?
			I refuse to let arithmetic decide
			questions like that!
			Did you learn anything of the
			relationship between the Edo and
			that? Why are they so certain
			it is "God?"
			Any sufficiently advanced life
			form can appear to others to be
			that, sir.
			But when they were probing my
			thoughts, Captain, I could feel
			that whatever they are now, they
			once existed in this dimension,
			just as we do. Perhaps also in
			the same kind of "flesh and blood"
			form. Since then, however, they
			have evolved considerably further.
			Their present existence in mixed
			dimensions no doubt has advantages
			we do not understand...
			Then, in their earlier flesh and
			blood existence they could have
			once shared our kind of values.
			The Edo share them, sir.
			Why would advanced things like
			that feel obliged to protect the
			Edo?
			Perhaps because the Edo are a
			child-race by comparison.
			Possibly a race which the life
			forms over there "planted" here
			much as we now plant human
			colonies on Class-M planets.
			Having fulfilled my professional
			obligations regarding Commander
			Data...
			You now request permission to beam
			down -- permission granted.
			You can accompany me while I try
			to resolve this.
			And you should know that whatever
			the cost, I will not allow them
			to execute your son.
			Thank you, sir.
			Take command, Data.
			Aye, sir.
			Almost dark.
			I want the boy brought here now.
			I'll go along with you.
			Of course.
			Captain Picard...
			I saw you share the sky with God.
			You must be Gods.
			And the boy too.
			No, no, we're not "Gods."
			Your own idea of that is much
			better for you at this time...
			Mother...
			I guess you know a lot has
			happened here...
			I know.
			Are you going to let them kill
			me, sir?
			No.
			But I'd like to prevent it in a
			way you can understand...
			How can we let this happen,
			Liator? Everything we respect,
			our law, our peace, our world's
			order...
			You are more powerful but we beg
			you not to do this to us. At
			least study what we once were --
			hurtful to each other, savage,
			thieving...
			We understand. In fact, your
			system of law and punishment may
			be better than many we once had.
			But he has laws he must obey too.
			And one of them says he must
			protect his people from harm.
			We did not ask you to come here...
			Which has to do with another law
			I must obey. All of us are sworn
			not to interfere with other life
			in the galaxy. I am caught
			between the two. If I save this
			young man, I break that law...
			And you should be executed if you
			do so!
			I may suffer almost as much.
			Starfleet takes our Prime
			Directive very seriously...
			No, it is God who will punish you!
			That has crossed our minds too.
			Our laws have been violated. What
			of justice?
			What of justice to Wesley? Does
			he deserve to die?
			What makes our law strong is the
			certainty of punishment!
			But my son had no warning...
			We cannot allow ignorance of the
			law to become a defense...
			Is it possible we are wrong about
			that? Surely there is such a
			thing as too much harshness...
			We do not dispense mercy... only
			justice.
			Their sun is almost down, sir.
			Stand ready to beam out.
			The question of justice has
			concerned me a good deal lately.
			Pained me. Until now, Liator.
			I realize now that there can be
			no justice...
			God will destroy you!
			... no justice so long as laws are
			absolute. Life itself is an
			exercise in exceptions.
			Bravo. When has justice ever been
			as simple as a rulebook, sir?
			Six to beam up, Captain?
			Six to beam up.
			God will punish you!
			Main Viewer on!
			Greetings, Jailbird.
			Hailing frequencies open.
			Open, sir.
			To the object sharing this
			orbit... we will remove the human
			colonists from the adjoining solar
			system if signaled to do so. Or
			we'll proceed on our mission, if
			signaled to do that. Please tell
			us...
			Captain!
			Is that a signal?
			I was hoping for more.
			More of what, sir? I'm happy it's
			gone.
			We're all thrilled with that, sir.
			I was hoping we'd learn more about
			it. But since we can't...
			Take us out of here, Number One.
			Gladly, sir.
