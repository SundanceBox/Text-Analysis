			Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1.
			We have moved into orbit around
			Bre'el Four to investigate a
			potentially catastrophic threat
			to the population from a
			descending asteroidal moon...
			The satellite's trajectory
			continues to deteriorate,
			Captain... This orbit will bring
			it to within five hundred
			kilometers of the planet's
			surface.
			We're predicting the atmospheric
			drag will bring it down on the
			next orbit.
			Have you been able to find any
			explanation for this?
			No, Doctor... it is a most unusual
			phenomenon.
			Won't the moon disintegrate prior
			to impact?
			No, it has a ferrous crystaline
			structure and will be able to
			withstand tidal forces, Captain...
			Couldn't we just blow it into
			harmless chunks?
			The total mass of the moon would
			remain the same, Commander. And
			the impact of thousands of
			fragments would spread destruction
			over an even wider area.
			How long before impact...
			Twenty-nine hours... projected
			somewhere on the western
			continent. It would destroy an
			area eight hundred kilometers in
			radius.
			That damage would be
			insignificant, Captain, compared
			to the seismic repercussions...
			massive landquakes, and
			tsunami...
			The force would raise a cloud of
			dust around the planet, leading
			to a significant temperature
			reduction. We could be looking
			at our own ice age.
			Commander La Forge, is there any
			way the Enterprise might be able
			to coax this satellite back where
			it belongs... ?
			We'd need to apply a delta-vee
			of at least four kilometers per
			second. Even with warp power to
			the tractor beam, it would mean
			exceeding recommended impulse
			engine output by at least
			forty-seven percent. It'd be like
			an ant pushing a tricycle... a
			slim chance at best...
			Given a choice between slim and
			none, I'll take slim any day...
			Make it so.
			Lieutenant Worf, signal all ships
			in this sector to rendezvous and
			join us in relief efforts.
			Aye, sir.
			We'll keep you informed of our
			progress. Picard out.
			Can you give us any more,
			Geordi... ?
			Not without burning out the
			tractor beam emitter... the
			circuits are already beyond their
			thermal limit.
			Delta-vee is ninety-two meters per
			second. The mass is too great.
			We are having an effect but it
			is negligible.
			What is that...
			Unable to identify source...
			Impulse engines passing saftey
			limits. We're seconds from
			automatic shutdown.
			Reduce engines... tractor beam
			off...
			Worf, what the hell do the sensors
			show... ?
			The sound is not registering,
			Commander...
			Red Alert.
			Q.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			are no closer to finding a
			solution to the deteriorating
			orbit of the Bre'el Four moon...
			but with the arrival of Q, we now
			have a good idea of the cause.
			We couldn't drive the tractor
			emitters hard enough, Captain...
			The beam was flexing, and it was
			impossible to transfer enough
			kinetic energy to the moon...
			Our options?
			We did everything by the book and
			a little extra... we need more
			time or more power and we're short
			on both. I'll take a look and see
			if there are any rules I haven't
			broken.
			Keep me advised.
			We know you're behind this, Q...
			It's not at all my best color...
			Behind what... what are you
			blathering about, Riker...
			What kind of twisted pleasure does
			it give you to bring terror into
			their lives... ?
			What? Whose lives?
			The millions of people down there
			who are watching as their moon
			falls out of the sky...
			I haven't the vaguest idea what
			you're talking about... and I have
			a much more serious problem...
			I am no longer a member of the
			continuum. My superiors have
			decided to punish me.
			And punish us as well, it seems...
			They said I've spread too much
			chaos through the universe and
			they have stripped me of all my
			powers.
			You do not believe me... ? Would
			I humiliate myself like this?
			If it served your purposes, yes.
			It is the truth. I stand before
			you, defrocked. I'm condemned
			to be a member of this lowest of
			species. A normal, imperfect,
			lumpen human being.
			Turning you into a human was part
			of their punishment... ?
			No, it was my request. I could
			have chosen to exist as a
			Markoffian fire lizard or a
			Belzoidian flea, anything I
			wished... so long as it was
			mortal, but I only had a fraction
			of a second to mull and I chose...
			"this"... and asked them to bring
			me here...
			Why?
			Because in all the universe you
			are the closest thing I have to
			a friend, Jean-Luc.
			He is reading as fully human.
			Is there an echo in here?
			I'm even sensing an emotional
			presence in him. I would
			normally describe it as being
			terrified.
			How rude.
			Q, what is it you want...
			Your compassion...
			All right... Sanctuary on your
			ship... dreary as that may sound
			to both of us...
			Return the moon to its orbit.
			I have no powers. Q the ordinary.
			Q, the liar. Q, the misanthrope.
			Q, the miserable. Q, the
			desperate. What must I do to
			convince you people...
			Die.
			Very clever, Worf. Eat any good
			books lately?
			Fine. You wish to be treated as
			a human?
			Absolutely.
			Mister Worf, throw him in the
			brig.
			Delighted, Captain.
			Jean-Luc... you can't do this...
			You will walk or I will carry you.
			Given the options -- I'll walk.
			You've disappointed me, Jean-
			Luc... I'm very disa...
			It was a mistake... I never should
			have picked human... I knew it
			the minute I said it.
			To think of the future in this
			shell... forced to cover myself
			with fabric because of outdated
			human morality, to say nothing
			of being too hot or too cold,
			growing feeble as the years pass,
			losing my hair, catching a
			disease, being ticklish, sneezing,
			having an itch, a pimple, bad
			breath, having to bathe...
			Too bad.
			"Klingon"... I should have said
			"Klingon". In my heart, I am a
			Klingon, Worf... So you understand
			I could never survive in
			confinement...
			The universe has been my back
			yard... this is cruel and unusual
			punishment. As a fellow Klingon,
			if you would speak to the captain
			on my behalf, I would be eternally
			grateful... which doesn't mean
			as much as it used to, I admit.
			Be quiet or disappear back where
			you came from.
			I can't disappear any more than
			you can win a beauty contest.
			If I ask a very simple question,
			do you think you can grasp it
			without troubling your intellect
			too much... ready? If I still
			had powers, would I permit you
			to lock me away?
			You have fooled us too often, Q.
			Perspicacity incarnate. Please
			don't feel compelled to tell me
			the story of "the boy who cried
			Worf"?
			Computer, activate forcefield.
			I demand to be let out of here,
			do you hear me? You will
			deactivate this cell immediately.
			"Romulan". I should have said
			"Romulan", you Klingon goat!
			The question is -- what sort of
			jaded game is he playing this
			time?
			Maybe he just wants a big laugh.
			He'll take Bre'el Four to the edge
			of disaster, then pull the moon
			back.
			Or he may have nothing to do with
			it at all.
			Do you honestly believe Q is
			telling the truth?
			Oh, I agree that is highly
			unlikely. But we have to proceed
			with our current dilemma as though
			Q is powerless to prevent it,
			don't we?
			As he sits, and watches us
			struggle...
			I don't see much choice.
			Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four
			science station...
			They're standing by, Captain...
			I'm sorry to report that our first
			attempt to restore the moon to
			its proper orbit has failed.
			We have less than twenty-five
			hours before impact...
			Our chief engineer is working on
			ways to reinforce our tractor beam.
			There is hope... but if you have
			an evacuation plan...
			We have already started moving
			people from the coastal areas of
			the western continent...
			We will make another attempt
			shortly... Picard out.
			I gotta tell you Geordi is not
			optimistic...
			What the devil... ?
			Data... ?
			Sensors are showing broad band
			emissions... including Berthold
			rays...
			Lethal?
			No, Commander. Overall exposure
			is under seventy-five rems. Very
			low intensity. More like a soft
			medical scan... I would speculate
			that we are being probed...
			By whom?
			The sensors cannot identify point
			of origin. It seems to be coming
			from all around us...
			Ah, you've come to apologize...
			how nice... no offense taken...
			all is forgiven...
			Enough. I want to know exactly
			what is going on, Q...
			But Jean-Luc, how can I know what
			is going on? I have been in this
			dungeon of yours, helpless and
			alone... bored to tears...
			We have a moon that is
			inexplicably falling out of
			orbit... and now the ship has been
			probed with Berthold radiation...
			When? I wasn't aware of it.
			Truthfully, Jean-Luc. I have
			been entirely preoccupied by a
			most frightening experience of
			my own. A couple of hours ago,
			I started realizing this body was
			no longer functioning properly...
			I felt weak, the life oozing out
			of me... I could no longer
			stand... and then I lost
			consciousness...
			You fell asleep...
			It's terrifying... how can you
			stand it day after day...
			One gets used to it...
			What other dangers are in store
			for me... I am totally unprepared
			for this... I need guidance...
			I am unwilling to play along, Q.
			If you must keep up the charade,
			you will do it alone...
			Jean-Luc... wait...
			This is getting on my nerves...
			now that I have nerves...
			You have a moon with a
			deteriorating orbit... I've known
			moons across the universe... big
			ones, small ones... I'm an
			expert... I can help you with this
			one... if you let me out of here.
			Q, we're dealing with millions
			of lives... if you have the power
			to...
			I have no power... But I still
			have the knowledge... locked in
			this puny brain. You cannot
			afford to dismiss that advantage,
			can you?
			Mister Data, please report to
			Detention Cell Three. Computer,
			remove the forcefield.
			If this is what I must do to save
			those lives, I will.
			You will not be left alone for
			one moment while you are on this
			ship, Q. If you are human, which
			I seriously doubt, I suggest you
			work hard to earn our welcome.
			Oh, I'll earn your welcome. You
			only dislike me. There are others
			in the cosmos that truly despise
			me.
			You are hereby assigned to Q for
			the remainder of his stay...
			escort him to Mister La Forge in
			Engineering...
			Can I have a Starfleet uniform...
			What are you looking at?
			I was considering the possibility
			that you are telling the truth...
			and really are human.
			It's the ghastly truth, Mister
			Data... I can now stub my toe with
			the best of them.
			An irony.
			It would mean you have achieved
			in disgrace what I have always
			aspired to be.
			Humans are such commonplace little
			creatures. They roam the galaxy
			looking for something, and they
			don't even know what it is.
			The human race has an enduring
			desire for knowledge, and for new
			opportunities to improve itself...
			There is certainly room for
			improvement. The truth is, Data,
			they are a minor species in the
			grand scheme. Not worth your
			envy...
			Oh, I do not feel envy.
			Good.
			I feel nothing at all. That is
			part of my dilemma. I have the
			curiosity of the human... but there
			are some questions I will never be
			able to answer... what is it like to
			laugh or to cry or to experience
			any human emotion... ?
			Believe me, life's a lot simpler
			without feelings... a lot
			simpler...
			The moon will hit its perigee in
			ten hours... we match its
			trajectory... increase emitter
			coolant rate so we can apply
			continuous warp-equivalent power
			nine to the tractor beam. We can
			keep pushing it for nearly seven
			hours and I think that might do
			it... but there's a problem...
			The Enterprise will be dangerously
			close to the atmosphere.
			That's the problem.
			This is incredible.
			You see something here, Q?
			I think I just hurt my back. I'm
			feeling pain. I don't think I
			like it. What's the right thing
			to say... "ow"?
			Yeah...
			Ow. I don't think I can
			straighten up...
			Medical assistance to
			Engineering...
			Q, I've got a few people down on
			Bre'el Four who are gonna be hurt
			if we don't...
			Yes, with your marvelous plan,
			you will not only tear the moon
			to pieces... but your precious
			ship as well.
			You have a better idea... ?
			I would certainly begin by
			examining the cause and not the
			symptom.
			We've done that, Q... and there's
			no way to determine...
			This is obviously the result of
			a large celestial object passing
			through at near right angles to
			the plane of the star system...
			probably a black hole...
			Can you recommend a way to counter
			the effect?
			Simple. Change the gravitational
			constant of the universe.
			What... ?
			Change the gravitational constant
			of the universe. And thereby
			alter the mass of the asteroid...
			Redefine gravity. How am I
			supposed to do that?
			You just do it. Where is that
			doctor anyway... ?
			Geordi is trying to say that
			changing the gravitational
			constant of the universe is beyond
			our capabilities.
			Oh. In that case, never mind.
			Ah, Doctor Crusher, Starfleet
			shipped you back into exile, I
			see...
			Q says he has hurt his back...
			Uh huh.
			Well, I wouldn't believe it if
			I didn't see it with my own eyes,
			... and I still don't believe
			it... according to this, you have
			classic back trauma, muscle
			spasms...
			I've been under a lot of stress.
			Family problems...
			You won't get any sympathy from
			me. You've been a pain in our
			backside often enough...
			Your bedside manner is admirable,
			Doctor. I'm sure your patients
			recover quickly just to get away
			from you.
			You know, it might work...
			We can't change the gravitational
			constant of the universe but if
			we wrap a low level warp field
			around that moon, we could reduce
			its gravitational constant...
			make it lighter so we can push
			it.
			Glad I could help.
			Ow... I think.
			Now what?
			Something's wrong with my
			stomach...
			It hurts?
			It's making noise.
			Maybe you're hungry.
			What do I ask for? I've never
			eaten before.
			The choice of meal is determined
			by individual tastes.
			What do you like?
			Although I do not require
			sustenance, I occasionally ingest
			a semi-organic nutrient suspension
			in a silicon-based liquid medium.
			Is it good?
			It would be more accurate to
			say it is "good for me" as it
			lubricates my bio-functions.
			It doesn't sound too appealing.
			What else is there?
			A wide variety of items... the
			replicator can make anything you
			desire.
			How am I supposed to know what
			I desire?
			I have observed that many food
			selections are influenced by the
			mood of the person ordering...
			I'm in a dreadful mood... get me
			something appropriate...
			When Counselor Troi is in an
			unhappy mood, she often has
			something chocolate...
			Chocolate...
			For example, a hot fudge sundae.
			I cannot speak from personal
			experience, but I have seen it
			often has a profound psychological
			impact.
			I'll have ten hot fudge sundaes.
			I have never seen anyone eat ten.
			I'm in a really bad mood. And
			since I've never eaten before,
			I should be very hungry.
			This... is not a moment I've been
			looking forward to.
			I heard you were drummed out of
			the continuum.
			I prefer to look at it as a
			significant career change.
			Just one of the boys, huh?
			One of the boys with an IQ of
			two thousand and five.
			The Captain and much of the crew
			are not yet convinced that he is
			truly human.
			Is that right?
			AAAH...
			He's human.
			This is a dangerous creature.
			You have no idea... how could
			Picard allow her to join the crew
			and not me...
			It must be frightening... totally
			defenseless... after being
			omnipotent all those centuries...
			I'm warning you... I still have
			friends in high places...
			... terrorizing one race after
			another... teasing them like
			helpless animals... delighting
			at the fear of your victims...
			From now on, I'll do missionary
			work...
			That would be a very noble cause,
			Q.
			You could learn a few things from
			this one.
			Sure, the robot who teaches the
			course in humanities.
			I am an android, not a robot.
			I beg your pardon.
			Get used to it, Q.
			What?
			Begging. You're a pitiful excuse
			for a human and the only way
			you're going to survive is by the
			charity of others.
			I'm not hungry.
			Captain, sensors are picking up
			a cloud of energetic plasma...
			bearing three-four-one mark
			two-zero... range twelve kilometers
			and closing...
			On screen.
			Energy patterns are reading as
			highly organized...
			A lifeform?
			Mister Worf, attempt to make
			contact...
			Receiving a signal, sir... on
			speaker...
			Computer, analysis of signal...
			Signal patterns indicate
			intelligence. Unable to derive
			necessary referants to establish
			translation matrix.
			Calamarain...
			We're being hit by a field of
			energetic tachyons... penetrating
			the hull... location... deck
			ten... forward...
			Red alert.
			Increase power to shields...
			Increasing power by twenty
			percent...
			No effect...
			Increasing to forty percent...
			Still no effect...
			Adjusting shield harmonics...
			Diverting power to the forward
			grids.
			The added harmonics are blocking
			the tachyon field.
			HELP ME. SOMEBODY HELP ME...
			How the mighty have fallen.
			Captain's log, supplemental. We
			have sustained light damage from
			an attack by an alien species
			known as the Calamarain. They
			apparently have a grievance with
			Q... no doubt one of many
			lifeforms that do.
			The Calamarain are not very
			hospitable creatures. They exist
			as swirls of ionized gas.
			What did you do to them to
			motivate such a vengeance?
			Nothing bizarre. Nothing
			grotesque.
			You tormented them --
			A subjective term, Riker. One
			creature's torment, is another
			creature's delight. They simply
			have no sense of humor... a
			character flaw with which you can
			personally identify.
			I say we turn him over to them.
			Oh, my mistake... you do have a
			sense of humor... a dreadful one.
			I'm serious.
			Of course. You knew this would
			happen, didn't you?
			I assure you one cannot anticipate
			the Calamarain, Picard... they're
			intelligent, yes... but
			undependable... very flighty...
			But you have so many enemies, Q,
			of various shapes and sizes...
			certainly you must have been
			concerned that once you became
			mortal... some of them might try
			to look you up...
			It occurred to me.
			With all your chatter about
			"friendship", the real reason
			you're here is for protection,
			isn't it?
			You're so bright, Jean-Luc. Yes,
			of course, you're correct. I know
			human beings. You are all sopping
			over with compassion and
			forgiveness. The human race can't
			wait to absolve almost any
			offense. It's an inherent
			weakness in the breed.
			What you call weakness, some of
			us would call strength.
			Call it what you want, Picard.
			I know you'll protect me even
			though I've tortured you now and
			again...
			Fighting off every species you've
			insulted would be a full time
			mission. And it's not the one
			I signed up for.
			Indeed. Human or not, I want no
			part of you. We will deposit you
			at the first starbase. Let them
			deal with you...
			But I can be a valuable member
			of your team, Picard...
			As though you have the faintest
			notion about team-work or
			cooperation...
			I can learn. I'm human.
			Then I suggest you apply to
			Starfleet Academy...
			Don't use me as a reference.
			He has provided important
			theoretical guidance for Geordi's
			analysis of the Bre'el satellite,
			Captain.
			It seems you have an advocate,
			Q.
			I am only stating a fact,
			Counselor.
			Mister La Forge, your status?
			I've been putting together a
			program to extend the forward
			lobe of our warp field. The field
			coils are not designed to envelop
			such a large volume. But I'm
			attempting to modify their
			alignment parameters.
			Maintaining field integrity will
			be difficult, Geordi.
			I think we can do it manually.
			The moon's reaching its perigee
			in fourteen minutes...
			Mister Data, escort Q to
			Engineering...
			You will assist Mister La Forge.
			Mister Worf, hail the Bre'el Four
			science station.
			Picard really thinks I can't cut
			it on his starship... I can do
			anything his little trained
			minions can do.
			I do not perceive that your skills
			are doubted, Q. I believe the
			captain is more concerned with
			your ability to interact
			successfully with... his "little
			trained minions".
			Human interpersonal relationships
			are most complex... your
			experiences may not have
			adequately prepared you.
			I don't want human interpersonal
			relationships. I just want to
			prove to Picard that I'm
			indispensable.
			To function aboard a starship,
			or in any human activity, you will
			have to form relationships.
			Why does this have to be so
			hard...
			Of more immediate importance is
			your ability to work within
			groups...
			I've never been any good in
			groups... it's difficult working
			in a group when you're
			omnipotent...
			The tides reached ten meters on
			the last orbit. They are already
			beginning to swell again. We have
			a lot of frightened people down
			here, Captain...
			Your moon has begun moving toward
			its perigee, Doctor... we are
			prepared to make our attempt...
			Our population has already taken
			shelter... but I'm afraid no
			shelter will be adequate if you
			fail... Especially for the
			people on the western continent.
			Whatever the results, we know
			you've done your best, Picard.
			It's appreciated.
			I'll keep you advised, Doctor.
			Picard out.
			Captain, sensors are reading
			increased energy output from the
			Calamarain...
			La Forge to bridge. The moon has
			reached its minimum orbital
			distance... it's time, Captain...
			We'll have to lower shields...
			Proceed.
			Mister Worf, keep a close eye on
			Q's friends out there...
			Understood.
			Okay, everyone, here's what we're
			going to do...
			Q, everybody already knows what
			they're going to do, except for
			you... now here's what I need...
			La Forge, obviously my knowledge
			and experience exceed yours...
			by about a billion times... so
			if you'll just step aside
			gracefully...
			Your experience will be most
			valuable to me if you can manually
			control the field integrity...
			Don't be foolish. That's a waste
			of my talents...
			Get to the controls or get the
			hell out of here...
			Data, you're my liason to the
			bridge... I'll need you with me...
			Who does he think he is to give
			me orders...
			Geordi thinks he is in command
			here... and he is correct.

			Lowering shields. Engage tractor

			Extending warp field forward.
			Engineering, is that the forward
			limit?
			Yes, Captain... we are unable to
			encompass the entire moon...
			Do you recommend we proceed... ?
			The two parts of the moon will have
			different inertial densities...
			I can adjust the field symmetry
			to compensate...
			I doubt it.
			You don't know what this ship can
			do, Mister...
			Yes, Captain... I think it still
			might work... increasing power
			to tractor beam and warp field...
			And if you're wrong, the moon will
			crumble due to subspace stress...
			don't say I didn't warn...
			Shut up, Q.
			I will not be spoken to in this
			manner...
			Data...
			Q, I strongly advise that you
			return to your post.
			Inertial mass of the moon has
			decreased to approximately
			two-point-five million metric

			Moving to full impulse power...
			we've gotta get out of here...
			Calamarain are resuming attack...
			They've overpowered the shields...

			thirty-six... Engineering...
			Geordi, can you direct any more
			power to the shields... ?
			We need all the power we have to
			get out of the atmosphere,
			Commander.
			Try activating the structural
			integrity field.
			It's not working. Structural
			field harmonics on manual.
			Hull temperature falling, Geordi...
			we're in the clear...
			Diverting power to forward section.
			Now.
			Data... Data... ?
			What about me?
			The charge nearly knocked out his
			positronic net.
			What can you do for him?
			We'll try to discharge and reset
			the motor pathways, recouple
			autonomic nodes...
			There's overpressure in his
			fluidic systems, thermal shock...
			If he was mortal, he'd be dead.
			Let us not overstate matters here,
			Doctor... I am mortal and I
			survived...
			The cheers are overwhelming.
			You exceed your own standards of
			selfish preoccupation. Have you
			no concern for the officer who
			very probably saved your life?
			He's strong, he'll survive.
			Osmotic pressure still negative.
			Maybe if we by-passed the flow
			regulator...
			It would be helpful if everybody
			just got out of here now...
			We'll let you know as soon as
			there's anything to tell you.
			Geordi, the moon's trajectory... ?
			All we did was buy ourselves
			another orbit at most... we can
			try again when it comes back to
			the perigee...
			And when we drop our shields, the
			Calamarains go after Q again...
			He's not worth it, Commander.
			Come...
			You're right, of course. I am
			extraordinarily selfish. It's
			served me so well in the past...
			It will not serve you here.
			Don't be so hard on me, Jean-Luc.
			You've been mortal all your life.
			You know all about dying. I've
			never given it a second thought.
			Or a first thought for that
			matter.
			I could have been killed. If
			not for Data... that one, brief
			delay he created, I would have
			been gone. No more me. And
			nobody would have missed me, would
			they?
			And yet Data may have sacrificed
			himself for me. Why? Why would
			he risk his own life for mine?
			That is his special nature. He
			has learned the lessons of
			humanity well...
			I ask myself if I would have done
			the same for him. And I am forced
			to realize the answer is no. And
			I feel... I feel ashamed.
			I am not your father confessor.
			You will not receive absolution
			from me, Q. You have brought
			nothing but pain and suffering
			to my crew. And to this very
			moment, I am not entirely
			convinced that this is still not
			your latest attempt at a bad joke.
			It is a bad joke. On me. I am
			the joke of the universe. The
			king who would be man.
			As I learn more and more about
			what it is to be human, I am more
			and more convinced that I will
			never make a good one. I just
			don't have what it takes,
			Jean-Luc. Without my powers,
			I'm frightened of everything. I'm
			a coward. I'm miserable.
			And I don't think I can go on this
			way.
			He's going to be all right.
			We're recalibrating his language
			circuits... he can't talk to us
			yet.
			There are creatures in the
			universe who consider you the
			ultimate achievement, android.
			No feelings, no emotions -- no
			pain. And yet you covet those
			qualities of humanity. Believe
			me, you are not missing anything.
			But if it means anything to you,
			Data... you are a better human
			than I.
			Where's the Main Shuttlebay?
			Main Shuttlebay is located on deck
			four.
			Take me there...
			An unscheduled shuttlecraft has
			just been launched.
			On Main Viewer.
			Opening hailing frequency.
			Frequency open.
			Shuttle occupant. Identify
			yourself.
			Don't try to talk me out of it,
			Jean-Luc.
			Q? Return to the ship at once.
			I just can't get used to following
			orders.
			Captain, the plasma cloud is
			moving toward the shuttle.
			It's easier this way. They won't
			bother you after I'm gone.
			Engineering, prepare to extend
			shields...
			Please, do not fall back on your
			tired cliche of charging to the
			rescue in the nick of time... I
			do not wish to be rescued... My
			life as a human being is a dismal
			failure. Maybe my death can have
			a little dignity.
			There is no dignity in suicide...
			Yes, I suppose you're quite right.
			The death of a coward. So be it.
			Anyway, as a human, I'd die of
			boredom.
			This goes against all my better
			judgment...
			Transporter Room Three, lock on
			to Shuttle One... beam it back to
			it's bay.
			Aye, Captain...
			Well, it's a perfectly good
			shuttlecraft...
			Captain, unable to transport...
			For some reason, I can't lock on...
			Worf, are you sensing any sort
			of interference from the
			Calamarain?
			No, Commander, but they are
			continuing to move toward the
			shuttle.
			Geordi, extend shields around
			Shuttle One...
			Extending shields ...
			Commander... the shields are
			frozen...
			Cause...
			Unknown.
			Lock on tractor beam...
			Tractor beam is not functioning
			either...
			What the hell is going on?
			Not bad, Q. Not great. But not
			bad.
			Q...
			Sacrificing yourself for these
			humans... ? Do I detect a selfless
			act... ?
			You flatter me. I'm only trying
			to put a quick end to a miserable
			existence.
			What a dreadful color.
			What are you doing here?
			I've been keeping track of you.
			Really? I always felt you were
			in my corner...
			Actually, I was the one who got
			you kicked out...
			You're incorrigible, Q, a lost
			cause. I can't go to a single
			solar system without apologizing
			for you... and I'm tired of it...
			I wasn't the one who misplaced
			the entire Deltived asteroid
			belt...
			This is not about me.
			I have better places to be. But,
			somebody had to keep an eye on
			you in case you still found a
			way to cause trouble... even as
			a member of this limited
			species...
			I hope I've kept you amused.
			Barely. But these humans are
			rather interesting... I'm
			beginning to understand what you
			see in them. After all the
			things you've done, they're still
			intent on keeping you safe.
			A genetic weakness of the race.
			And they're still at it. They
			just tried to beam you back or
			whatever they call it... I
			stopped them...
			Well then, if the Calamarain will
			just hurry up and finish this,
			we'll get you on your way...
			No, I put them on hold too.
			There's still this matter of the
			selfless act...
			You and I both know that the
			Calamarain would have eventually
			destroyed the Enterprise to get
			to you... and that's really why
			you left...
			It was... a tiny bit selfless...
			wasn't it...
			And there's my problem. I get
			back to the continuum and tell
			them you committed a selfless act
			just before the end... I'm gonna
			be tied up with questions and
			explanations for centuries...
			Q, I've learned my lesson...
			Remember who you're talking to
			here... all knowing, all seeing...
			Fine. You have your powers back.
			Try to stay out of trouble...
			And they wanted to destroy me,
			did they?
			If you think I tormented you in
			the past, my little friends --
			wait until you see what I do with
			you now.
			Q --?
			I was just seeing if you were
			still watching
			Sir, the aliens have disappeared.
			And so has the shuttle.
			Scan the sector...
			I have, sir.
			Well, I guess that's the end of
			Q.
			Au contraire, mon capitaine...
			heee's back...
			I have been forgiven, embraced
			by my brothers and sisters of the
			continuum... I am immortal again,
			omnipotent again...
			Swell.
			Don't fret, Riker... my good
			fortune is your good fortune.
			I don't need your fantasy women,
			Q...
			You've become so stolid,
			Commander... you weren't like this
			before the beard...
			Very well...
			Q...
			But I feel like celebrating...
			I don't.
			All of it.
			Now, at the risk of being rude...
			Yes, I have once again overstayed
			my welcome. As a human, I was
			ill-equipped to thank you, Picard.
			But as myself, you have my
			everlasting gratitude.
			Until next time, of course. But
			before I go, there is a debt I
			must repay...
			... to my professor of the
			humanities... I have decided my
			dear Data to give you something
			very, very special...
			If your intention is to make me
			human, Q...
			No no no no no... don't be
			foolish... I would never curse
			you by making you human... Let's
			just call it a going away present.
			Uh, Data... Data? Why are you
			laughing?
			I do not know. But it was a
			wonderful... feeling.
			Bre'el Four hailing us, Captain.
			On screen, Lieutenant.
			Captain Picard... you've done
			it...
			I'm sorry... ?
			The moon is back in its normal
			orbit. How did you manage it?
			I didn't. Stand by, Bre'el
			Four...
			Let's see it, Worf...
			Mister Data, your analysis...
			The moon's altitude is fifty-five
			thousand kilometers, projected
			orbit is nearly circular. There
			is no further danger to the
			planet.
			Good. Ensign, set a course for
			Station Nigala-Four.
			Perhaps there's a little humanity
			left in Q after all.
			Don't bet on it, Picard.
