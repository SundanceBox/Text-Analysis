			Captain's log, Stardate 43510.7.
			The Enterprise has put in at Rutia
			Four to deliver medical supplies
			following an outbreak of violent
			protests.
			Although non-aligned, the planet
			has enjoyed a long trading
			relationship with the Federation.
			We've still got a few minutes
			before our next meeting...
			Excuse me --
			Doctor...
			Put that thing away. I'm a
			doctor.
			Just lie still... don't try to
			move...
			Lieutenant, I need bandages...
			Disinfectant... something with
			alcohol in it ...
			Doctor, it is not safe...
			That's an order, Mister Worf...
			There's a lot of bleeding, but
			it's not as bad as it looks.
			Don't be afraid.
			The Klingon is right. These
			Ansata... they're madmen... there
			could be another bomb.
			Clear this area. Everyone out
			of the plaza.
			Doctor, a return to the Enterprise
			would be prudent.
			This planet does have
			physicians...
			Who aren't here yet. I am.
			Thank you.
			Not at all, Doctor.
			Captain, there has been an
			incident.
			... A bomb has been detonated by
			the Ansata terrorists.
			Your security status?
			Vulnerable, sir.
			Transporter Room Three, lock onto
			the away team, prepare to beam
			them back...
			Yes, Captain.
			Sir, I recommended such a course,
			but there are several wounded
			people and Doctor Crusher...
			Yes, I understand. Picard to
			Doctor Crusher...
			Go ahead.
			I've been advised of your
			situation by Mister Data.
			I already know what you're going
			to say.
			Doctor, will you at least allow
			me to...
			The longer we argue, the
			longer...
			You are endangering yourself and
			the away team...
			Captain, right now, I'm trying
			to pull a life back into a wounded
			body with brandy and sleight of
			hand. I'm not going anywhere...
			Data and Worf don't have to stay.
			Crusher out.
			Transporter Room, do you have lock
			on the away team?
			Aye, sir. Shall I transport them?
			I wouldn't want to be in the
			Transporter Room to greet her.
			Picard to Data. Hold your
			position until the Rutian medics
			arrive.
			Aye, Captain.
			The tricorder is not reading any
			other explosive devices in this
			vicinity...
			You don't understand... I'm a
			doc...
			A transporter would leave
			residual ionization in the air...
			but the tricorder readings found
			no trace after the incident...
			People don't just appear and
			disappear... there has to be some
			way to track her...
			We have been unable to detect the
			signal from her communicator.
			It has either been deactivated or
			she is being held in a shielded
			location.
			Why... her?
			Sir, I believe she was the
			intended target of the abduction.
			Why would they want a Federation
			hostage? Their fight doesn't
			involve us.
			It does now.
			Are you hungry? Do you want
			something to eat?
			I doesn't matter to me. You
			want to be hungry? Be hungry.
			What's your name?
			You're a doctor on a Federation
			starship?
			I always wondered what it would
			be like to travel across the
			galaxy.
			It's not something I've exactly
			had time for.
			This isn't the best way to meet
			new people, is it?
			If you want something, just ask
			for me -- Kyril Finn.
			They know me.
			We have no reason to believe she's
			been hurt in any way...
			In fact, it's more likely that
			they will take good care of her...
			if they want to use her as a
			bargaining chip.
			A bargaining chip?
			The innocent become the pawns in
			a conflict like this, Wesley.
			The Ansata separatists have been
			trying for generations to be freed
			from the rule of the Eastern
			Continent. If they can get the
			government to even acknowledge
			their demands, then kidnapping
			your mother will have served a
			purpose.
			That may be what they are after.
			It may not. Frankly, I don't
			care. All I care about is getting
			her back, Wesley... In a few
			minutes, we're leaving to meet
			with the authorities...
			Request permission to be on the
			away team, sir.
			No. You have an important job
			to do here. If we are to find
			your mother, we must have a way
			to trace the movements of these
			terrorists. I want you on the
			team that will investigate this
			new technology of theirs.
			I understand.
			Report to Mister Data. Dismissed.
			He needs your strength right now.
			History has shown us that strength
			may be useless in the face of
			terrorism, Counselor.
			What exactly is Ansata policy in
			regard to hostages?
			I doubt they have one. They don't
			usually take hostages.
			These aren't people we're dealing
			with here. They're animals...
			Fanatics, who kill without remorse
			or conscience... who think nothing
			of murdering innocent people.
			They could just as easily have
			shot her where she stood...
			Don't ask me to explain them.
			I can't. The atrocities I've
			seen...
			And now they have this new device
			that makes them even more deadly.
			How do I combat an enemy who fails
			to register on any scanner until
			they're literally standing in
			front of you with a phaser pointed
			at your head?
			What can you tell us about this
			device?
			Not much, really.
			They first started using it two
			months ago. We've taken several
			of these off dead terrorists.
			Our people have looked at them...
			Nothing they can explain...
			You mind if we take this with
			us... give our people a chance
			to study it?
			Not at all. And I'll put you in
			touch with our research people, if
			you wish.
			I appreciate your help.
			Perhaps if we found ourselves in
			possession of some of that
			advanced Federation weaponry of
			yours it would shift the balance
			of power back to our favor.
			That we cannot do for you.
			No, of course not.
			I would like to leave Commander
			Riker to assist in your search
			for Doctor Crusher.
			If you like...
			You don't sound very optimistic.
			I know my enemy, Commander...
			They don't leave much room for
			optimism.
			Are you hungry? Do you want
			something to eat?
			Relax, I'm just going to...
			Come on. Eat something. What's
			the point of not eating? You're
			the only one who suffers. Do I
			look like it's bothering me?
			Okay, it's bothering me.
			No forks. Sorry.
			Did I mention my name is Finn?
			And you're... ?
			Why have you brought me here?
			I need a doctor.
			There are doctors on Rutia.
			I need someone better... I heard
			you were here from the Federation
			flagship and I knew you had to
			be...
			How did you know that?
			I heard.
			Now you'll help me. Just like
			you help them...
			What are you talking about?
			Your ship carries medical
			supplies for them... for the other
			side... why does the Federation
			ally itself with the Rutians...
			We didn't... all we did was to
			bring...
			Medical supplies...
			People were hurt...
			I know. I hurt them.
			You're finished eating. Get up.
			Get up.
			I have... a son.
			You'll be with him again, Doctor.
			I see no reason to kill you.
			I need instruments from my ship
			to diagnose something like this...
			You think if I allowed you to call
			your ship, they would transport
			your instruments... ?
			When I inform the captain how
			serious the situation is, I'm sure
			he'll agree. I've told you, Finn,
			the Federation is not allied with
			Rutians... we came on an errand
			of mercy...
			And since the Federation does not
			wish to take sides, he will send
			you the medical supplies we need.
			Absolutely.
			I anticipated your needs.
			These are Federation supplies...
			we just delivered them to the
			medical dispensary this morning...
			I heard.
			You're telling me all these people
			belong to the Ansata?
			Not really. We suspect the
			organization itself only consists
			of some two hundred members. There
			are over five thousand names on
			this list. Citizens we know to
			be sympathetic to their cause.
			They pass along weaponry and
			information. March in pro-Ansata
			demonstrations... participate in
			general strikes.. or the
			occasional riot.
			How did all of this ever get
			started?
			We denied them independence.
			That gave them a noble cause...
			seventy years ago.
			And now it's just an excuse for
			more violence.
			You hate them as much as they hate
			you.
			Believe it or not I always
			considered myself moderate.
			What changed your mind?
			Being stationed here the last six
			months. Watching the body count
			grow. The three assassination
			attempts on my life.
			I can see where that could affect
			your point of view.
			But I guess the event that really
			opened my eyes took place only
			a few days after my arrival. A
			terrorist bomb destroyed a
			shuttlebus... sixty school
			children. There were no
			survivors.
			The Ansata claimed it was a
			mistake. That their intended
			target was a police transport.
			As if that made everything all
			right.
			That day I vowed to put an end
			to terrorism in this city. And
			I will.
			Thank you. You're very helpful...
			you could learn to do this when
			you grow up...
			... if you grow up.
			They're dying.
			I'm seeing a complicated set of
			conditions... their DNA is warped
			somehow; it's disrupting their
			entire cellular chemistry...
			You can't do anything?
			I can make them more comfortable.
			That's all. The damage is too
			extensive.
			If I could detect the condition
			earlier...
			... you would be able to reverse
			the damage?
			Perhaps. I don't know.
			What happened to them...
			It's the inverter.
			It has given our cause a new life.
			But asks for our lives in return.
			What does it do?
			We transport through a dimensional
			shift that the Rutian sensors
			can't trace.
			Dimensional shifting? You can't
			do that with humanoid tissue.
			There are risks... the designers
			warned us... but it works.
			You're showing the same distorted
			readings. Not as severe as the
			others but --
			Doesn't matter.
			It does if it kills you.
			Don't you know? A dead martyr's
			worth ten posturing leaders.
			A subspace field coil with an
			isolated power source...
			curious...
			How could something this small
			manage to get them anywhere?
			Hey, guys... look at this...
			The Rutian team picked up a faint
			nuclear vibration during the
			terrorist movements...
			Nuclear vibration...
			That could possibly indicate
			subspace transition rebound during
			transport...
			Wait a minute... computer, call
			up files on... what was it
			called...
			We spent an hour on it in my
			astral physics course last year...
			folded space transport...
			Alternate dimensions...
			Are you referring to the Elway
			Theorem?
			Yes... computer, files on the
			Elway Theorem... what if they're
			moving inter-dimensionally?
			But the Elway Theorem proved to
			be entirely inaccurate... all
			research was abandoned by the mid-
			twenty-third century...
			Data, look at it... the faint
			nuclear vibration is consistent...
			and Elway used an isolated field
			coil just like this one.
			It would be untraceable by any
			standard sensing device.
			But it was proven to be fatal.
			To use this technology would be
			an irrational act.
			We may well be dealing with
			irrational people, Data. Is there
			a way to trace this... ?
			With an adaptive subspace
			echogram, maybe... ?
			If anyone is willing to transport
			in this manner, Captain, they
			would suffer significant internal
			damage which could be detected.
			And it sounds as though they might
			require the services of... a
			doctor.
			This is no way to live.
			For us or them?
			For both of you.
			I know it's not pretty, Riker.
			But this is what terrorism has
			done to this city.
			There must be a better way than
			this to deal with it.
			I know my methods seem harsh but
			believe me, they're gentle
			compared to my predecessors.
			Suspects would be brought into
			police headquarters and...
			mysteriously vanish. I put a stop
			to that.
			And what happened to this
			predecessor of yours?
			He was murdered.
			Are you going to tell me that
			boy's a threat?
			It's possible.
			That shuttlebus I told you
			about... the bomb was set by a
			teenager.
			And in a world where children blow
			up children... everyone's a
			threat.
			You should be drawing, not
			killing people.
			I can do both.
			How can you have such a casual
			attitude toward killing?
			I take my killing very seriously,
			Doctor.
			You are an idealist...
			I live in an ideal culture...
			there is no need for your kind
			of violence... we've proven that.
			Your origins on Earth are from
			the American continent, are they
			not?
			North America.
			I have read your history books.
			This is a war for independence.
			I am no different than your own
			George Washington...
			Washington was a military general.
			He was not a terrorist.
			Doctor, the difference between
			a general and terrorist is only
			the difference between winners
			and losers. You win, you're
			called a general. You lose...
			You are killing innocent people...
			Can't you see the immorality of
			what you're doing... or have you
			killed so often, you've become
			blind to it?
			How much innocent blood has been
			spilled for the cause of freedom
			in the history of your Federation,
			Doctor? How many good and noble
			societies have bombed civilians
			in war? Wiped out whole cities.
			And now that you enjoy the comfort
			that has come from their battles,
			their killing... you frown on my
			immorality... ? Doctor, I am
			willing to die for my freedom.
			And, in the finest tradition of
			your own great civilization, I'm
			willing to kill for it too.
			All right you can go.
			If you want, I could become more
			persuasive.
			No.
			You're Katik Shaw, the waiter from
			the Lumar Cafe.
			You witnessed both the explosion
			and the kidnapping.
			I saw nothing.
			We are aware of your ties with
			the Ansata... For all we know
			you planted the bomb yourself...
			Where have they taken her?
			I don't know what you're talking
			about.
			I've had enough of this.
			I want you to take a message back
			to your people. Tell them the
			Federation is willing to negotiate
			for the release of Doctor Crusher.
			Riker... !
			She's a Starfleet officer. That
			makes her my responsibility.
			Your side has demands, we're
			willing to listen to them. We
			want her back. It's as simple
			as that.
			I don't think it's necessary to
			detain this gentleman any longer.
			Get out.
			I should have him followed, but
			we'll try it your way.
			Is that what you want?
			What I want is to go home. Back
			to my own country. To leave
			behind the roundups, the
			interrogations, the bodies lying
			in the street. To be able to walk
			without bodyguards, and not have
			to jump at every unexpected noise.
			That's what I want Riker.
			The dimensional jump creates a
			subspace pressure modulation,
			Captain. By setting up a
			magnetosphere faint echogram that
			can monitor each of their
			movements, we may be able to
			collect enough data to trace their
			power source.
			Can you estimate the number of
			jumps it will take?
			Dimensional shifting is such an
			unstable procedure that I cannot
			say.
			Captain, I am finding it difficult
			to understand many aspects of
			Ansata conduct. Much of their
			behavioral norm would be defined
			by my program as unnecessary and
			unacceptable.
			And by my... "program" as well,
			Data.
			But, if that is so, Captain, why
			are their methods often
			successful?
			I have been reviewing the history
			of armed rebellion and it appears
			that terrorism is an effective
			way to promote political change.
			I have never subscribed to the
			theory that political power flows
			from the barrel of a gun, Data...
			In most instances, you would be
			correct. But there are numerous
			examples where it was
			successful... the independence
			of the Mexican State from Spain,
			the Irish Unification of 2024,
			the Kenzie Rebellion...
			Yes, I'm aware of them...
			Then, would it be accurate to say
			that terrorism is acceptable when
			the options for peaceful
			settlement have been foreclosed?
			Data, we cannot condone violence.
			Even in response to violence?
			These are questions that mankind
			has been struggling with since
			creation. I am afraid your
			confusion, Data... is only human.
			Everyone is being rounded up.
			Because of her?
			The Federation wants to negotiate
			her release...
			... while they arrange for the
			Rutian police to fill up the
			detention cells...
			A Starfleet officer is working
			with the director. He wants a
			meeting with you.
			I'm sure he does.
			Your Federation colleagues have
			engineered mass arrests to
			pressure me into releasing you.
			I'm sure you've misunderstood...
			They are working with the police.
			He's seen it with his own eyes.
			All they want is to get me back
			safely.
			I'm not going to release you.
			I need you here.
			To find a way to reverse the
			effects of the dimensional
			shift... ? I can do that right
			now. Stop using it.
			Finn, I have a life, a son who
			needs me.
			He is on the ship?
			I am sorry he is on the ship.
			No...
			They have joined forces with the
			Rutians against us...
			We are not your enemy...
			They are more valuable to me than
			an enemy.
			For seventy years we've been
			shouting, and no one's heard us.
			Destroy the Federation flagship...
			someone will listen.
			Please...
			They are the ones who interfered.
			They brought medical supplies.
			They organized mass arrests. They
			are killing your son, not me.
			Please, don't do this, Finn. I'll
			do anything you ask.
			I had a son, too. He was thirteen
			when he died in detention.
			Intruder alert deck twelve...
			I've got a subspace reflection.
			It's a dimensional shift...
			Red Alert. Sound general
			quarters.
			Security to Engineering.
			Intruders in Engineering...
			Casualties reported on deck
			twelve. Sickbay is responding.
			Seal off all decks... lock on
			transporters to intruder signals.
			Intruder signals unstable,
			Captain, I cannot lock on...
			They are moving inter-dimensionally...
			neither the
			transporters nor forcefields will
			be able to contain them, sir.
			Explosive charge on the main warp
			chamber...
			Transporter room three, lock on
			the explosive device and energize.
			It's scrambling the sensors,
			Captain... I can't pinpoint it.
			Begin emergency evacuation...
			prepare for saucer separation...
			Mister La Forge, can you remove
			the charge from the engine core...
			Stand by... I'm trying...
			They've got it locked on
			somehow... hold on...
			Got it. Transporter Room, stand
			by to lock on my signal and
			transport two kilometers off the
			starboard nacelle.
			His signal... ?
			Transporter Room, now...
			Commander La Forge. Report.
			Transport complete...
			I have a man down.
			More subspace reflections...
			Can you calibrate their
			destination?
			No, sir, the readings are --
			Transporter Room. Code one
			evacuation: Picard.
			Transporter Room...
			Lieutenant Worf is recovering in
			Sickbay. The wound was not
			severe.
			Dead and injured?
			Three dead, four wounded.
			Another millisecond, and there
			would have been a big dust cloud
			orbiting Rutia instead of the
			Enterprise.
			Why. I just asked if they would
			talk...
			You have your answer, Riker.
			Sir, the next time the Ansata use
			the dimensional jump we should
			be able to get a fix on their
			power source.
			Worf went down... I don't know
			if he's alive or dead... there
			were other casualties...
			Was... Wes... on the bridge...
			Yes...
			He took cover... I didn't see any
			more than that...
			Are you all right?
			They needed a doctor.
			Side effects of their transport?
			Yes...
			We're getting closer to tracing
			their movements... actually, it
			was Wesley who put us onto this
			dimensional jumping of theirs...
			He's been extraordinary throughout
			this. He'll make a fine officer,
			Beverly.
			He's had good role models...
			I'm sorry.
			If I'd just returned to the
			ship...
			I could have had you beamed up.
			You wouldn't dare.
			I would and I should have.
			Without my permission...
			If you won't follow orders...
			If you give reasonable orders,
			I'll obey reasonable orders...
			Doctor, I will be the judge of
			reason when it comes to my
			orders...
			There aren't any exits to the
			surface.
			Then the only way out is by
			transporter or the dimensional
			jump.
			A mode of travel I'd encourage
			you to avoid. It's killing them.
			They're mad.
			I don't know any more. The
			difference between a madman and
			a committed man willing to die
			for a cause... it's begun to blur
			over the last couple days...
			Beverly, I don't have to warn you
			about the psychological impact
			of being a hostage...
			I know. I understand that. But
			their leader, Finn, he's not what
			you'd expect...
			No, he's certainly not what I'd
			expect. Without cause or reason,
			his little band of outlaws has
			attacked my ship...
			But he did have reasons... the
			medical supplies, the arrests...
			Jean-Luc, if we really examine
			our role in this...
			Beverly, you are arguing for a
			man who may have murdered your
			son.
			I didn't kill your son...
			Beverly.
			We were not able to destroy the
			ship. We had to settle for him...
			She wouldn't even tell me her
			name. How many days? I call her
			"Doctor." Are you hungry? Do you
			want something to eat?
			You've made a grave
			miscalculation...
			Oh?
			You've assaulted a Federation
			starship, killed and wounded
			members of her crew, kidnapped
			two officers... do you not expect
			a response?
			On the contrary, I'm counting on
			it.
			You want Federation involvement?
			Captain, there's a lot to admire
			in the Federation, but there's
			a hint of moral cowardice in your
			dealings with non-aligned planets.
			You do business with a government
			that's crushing us. And then you
			say you aren't involved. But of
			course you are. You just don't
			want to get dirty.
			You accuse us of cowardice while you
			plant bombs in shadows...
			I've been fighting the only war
			I can against an intractable
			enemy. Now, I'm fighting a big
			war against a much more powerful
			adversary. Can't you see how that
			helps me?
			I'm afraid I don't.
			He has added a chair to the
			negotiating table.
			You added the chair, Captain.
			I am simply forcing you to sit
			in it. The Federation will
			quickly tire of our little war...
			they will want you back... they
			will want to get as far away from
			Rutia as they can. And I will
			not make it easy. Eventually,
			the Federation will force the
			government to make concessions.
			And then a few more. And then a
			few more.
			Until we can finally reach an
			honorable agreement that saves face
			for all sides.
			Except we win.
			You understand I will not
			cooperate in any way...
			You have already cooperated,
			Captain... just by coming here.
			I'm not here to hurt you. Just
			hear what I have to say.
			Your people are safe. How long
			they stay that way depends on you.
			We demand an embargo and trade
			sanctions levied against Rutia.
			The Federation will blockade the
			planet... allow no ships in or
			out. This will continue until
			the government of Rutia consents
			to talks mediated by a Federation
			counsel. You have twelve hours
			to make your decision.
			Got it.
			We've pinpointed the Ansata base
			some three hundred kilometers from
			the city, on the southern tip of
			the continent.
			Sensors indicate it is located
			thirty meters below ground,
			implying a cave or cavern-like
			dwelling.
			Any passages leading to the
			surface?
			Our readings show no evidence of
			any, Commander.
			Then whatever light they have must
			be artificially generated.
			If we can shut it down, you could
			use the confusion to find your
			people.
			Request permission to join the
			rescue party, sir.
			I owe it to the captain.
			Permission granted.
			Mister Data... You have the
			bridge.
			Commander Riker?
			Good luck.
			We'll bring them home, Wes.
			You're glad to see your captain...
			Yes.
			I may have to kill him.
			I just wanted to warn you.
			Finn, he can help you... he is
			very influential...
			He will not help us...
			If you could convince him that
			your cause is...
			You could convince him perhaps.
			Not I.
			I've talked to him. I'll...
			try...
			If our places were reversed, I
			would expect to die...
			Your places would never be
			reversed. He wouldn't forcibly
			abduct you... or play games with
			your life. He would treat you with
			respect...
			I have treated you with
			respect...
			You've scared the hell out of me,
			Finn.
			You've controlled me through
			fear... just like you've tried
			to control this whole continent.
			You haven't tasted real fear yet,
			Doctor...
			Is that the best you can do? Is
			fear the only weapon you have...
			No, but it's a good one.
			You know what scares me the most,
			Finn? It scares me to think that
			you might win this fight and gain
			real power.
			Doctor... I don't want you to fear
			me.
			How dangerous would another ride
			through the inverter be to us?
			I'm not sure. But I don't want
			you to start thinking...
			It is our obligation to think of
			escape...
			He's prepared to kill you.
			A fine reason to escape...
			Do you think you've gained his
			confidence?
			Indeed, you have... and a bit
			more... this might prove to be
			an advantage, Doctor...
			Jean-Luc, there are some things...
			I want to say... just in case we
			don't get out of this...
			Have they found us... ?
			Finn...
			He's dead.
			You didn't have to kill him.
			As a prisoner he would have been
			a focus for violence as his
			followers tried to free him.
			Now, he's a martyr, but the death
			toll may be lower -- at least in
			the short term.
			An imperfect solution for an
			imperfect world.
			Captain...
			No more killing.
			Already another one to take his
			place... it never ends.
			He could have killed you. He
			didn't. Maybe the end begins with
			one boy putting down a gun.
			I hear I owe my rescue to you.
			I was just part of the team.
			It's good to have you back.
			Both of you. Sir.
			Take us out of orbit, Mister
			Crusher.
			At your convenience.
