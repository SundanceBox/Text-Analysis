			We have arrived at Tanuga Four,
			Captain. The away team has
			completed its survey of Doctor
			Apgar's work and is ready to
			return to the ship.
			Good.
			Please... and examine the work
			of the other students as well.
			Ensign Williams' striking style
			is heavily influenced by geometric
			constructivism.
			Lieutenant Wright has effectively
			fused the incongruities of the
			surrealists with the irrationality
			of Dadaism.
			Interesting.
			How so?
			While suggesting the free
			treatment of form usually
			attributed to Fauvism, this quite
			inappropriately attempts to
			juxtapose the disparate cubistic
			styles of Picasso and Leger. In
			addition, the use of color
			suggests a haphazard melange of
			clashing styles.
			Furthermore, the unsettling
			overtones of proto-Vulcan
			influences...
			Thank you... Mister Data.
			You are welcome, sir. If I may
			be of any further assistance --
			No... thank you.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43610.4.
			After completing a delivery of
			dicosilium to the Tanuga Four
			research station, our away team
			is receiving an update from
			Doctor Nel Apgar on his efforts
			to create Krieger Waves, a
			potentially valuable new power
			source.
			Welcome back, Mister La Forge.
			Where's Commander Riker?
			Still on the station, sir. Doctor
			Apgar wanted a word with him.
			Any problems... ?
			Not... with the scientific part
			of the mission, sir...
			Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready
			to leave now.
			I'm sure Commander Riker will
			explain, sir...
			Stand by, Commander. Engaging
			transport.
			Transporter Room to Engineering.
			I have a power drain...
			Transporter Room! Is Commander
			Riker aboard?
			Not yet, Captain. I'm having
			trouble clearing the signal...
			Transporter Room to bridge. He's
			aboard.
			You sound surprised, Mister
			O'Brien...
			For a moment, we weren't sure you
			left the space station in time...
			In time for what... ?
			It just exploded, sir.
			Captain's log, supplemental:
			Commander Riker has informed me
			that Doctor Apgar was the only
			one aboard the space station when
			it exploded. We remain in orbit
			investigating the accident...
			I've gone through the whole
			system, sir... I can't find any
			malfunction in the transporter,
			nothing that would cause an
			explosion like that...
			Why was there a power drain before
			transport?
			I don't know, Captain.
			I want an answer to that
			question... I'm sure the Tanugans
			will too...
			Yessir.
			Captain, the radiation and debris
			are consistent with an overload
			of the station's reactor core.
			Any indications of reactor core
			problems while you were on the
			station?
			No, sir.
			Number One... ?
			Commander La Forge suggested this
			was not an entirely routine
			mission...
			It's a long story, Captain...
			... but I'm sure it doesn't have
			anything to do with this accident.
			Captain, Chief Investigator Krag
			of the Tanugan security force
			requests permission to beam
			aboard.
			Granted, Lieutenant, please escort
			our guest to the bridge.
			...slowly.
			Aye, sir.
			Perhaps you should tell me as much
			as possible prior to his arrival,
			Number One.
			I am Lieutenant Worf, head of
			ship's security. I will take you
			to the captain.
			Chief Investigator, welcome to
			the Enterprise. I'm Captain
			Picard... my first officer,
			Commander William Riker.
			Commander Riker, I am here to take
			you into custody...
			On what charge?
			Suspicion of murder.
			Murder... now wait a minute...
			Chief Investigator... we are more
			than willing to cooperate fully
			with you, but...
			Then you will release the prisoner
			for transportation to the planet.
			Why don't we discuss this in
			private...
			You have the bridge, Number One.
			Just what is your evidence against
			my officer?
			Two witnesses have come forward
			to describe Commander Riker's
			threats against Doctor Apgar...
			Threats... ? I am aware of an
			altercation between the two of
			them...
			It apparently was much more than
			just an altercation, Captain...
			but he will have a chance to prove
			his innocence...
			In our system of legal
			jurisprudence, a man is innocent
			until proved guilty.
			In ours, he is guilty until he
			is proved innocent. And you are
			in our jurisdiction. If I
			understand the Federation
			regulations on these matters, and
			I just happened to look them up
			before I...
			I'm aware of the Federation
			regulations, sir... and if you
			will check further, they say the
			captain will decide if extradition
			is warranted...
			Are you saying it is not?
			I'm saying...
			If I find that there is sufficient
			cause to warrant a trial, I
			will... release Commander Riker
			to your custody.
			Would you say you're close to your
			first officer, Captain?
			That's irrelevant here...
			Really, Captain, you cannot
			believe that. And how can I
			expect a fair and impartial
			decision?
			I will protect the rights of my
			officer...
			I appreciate that. But you'll
			have to do it on the planet, not
			here. After all, what if you were
			suddenly to decide to leave this
			star system... ?
			You have my word as an officer
			of Starfleet that I will not.
			Unacceptable. You must turn him
			over to me for interrogation.
			Interrogate him here.
			Captain, we must recreate
			step-by-step, moment-by-moment,
			the events leading to the
			explosion... we need immediate
			access to all the witnesses, as
			well as the data from the lab's
			ground computers. It would be
			impossible to accomplish here.
			Perhaps not.
			Mister Data, please report to my
			Ready Room.
			In fact, I may be able to assist
			you in recreating the events.
			Commander Data, Chief Inspector
			Krag.
			Data, by taking testimony from
			both the away team and from
			witnesses provided by Investigator
			Krag, would it be possible to
			program the Holodeck to recreate
			what happened aboard the science
			station?
			It would require construction and
			design specifications, full
			orthographic representations of
			the Krieger equipment, as well
			as visual representations and
			voice analyses of the persons
			involved... but yes, it is
			possible.
			Very well. Arrangements will be
			made to provide you with all
			available information. I shall
			return shortly with our witnesses.
			Data, escort the chief inspector
			to Transporter Room Three.
			Mister La Forge, Ensign Crusher,
			we are going to recreate the
			research station on the Holodeck.
			I want you to work with Mister
			Data on the preparations. In
			addition, Mister La Forge, you
			and Commander Riker will give the
			computer detailed depositions on
			everything you heard and saw while
			aboard. Counselor, you will
			assist me during this inquiry.
			My decision on extradition will
			be based upon the evidence
			presented in these re-creations.
			Captain, may I have a word with
			you?
			Under these circumstances, I
			believe it would be inappropriate,
			Number One.
			Second officer's log, Stardate
			43611.6. Programming of the
			Holodeck has taken eighteen hours
			and is now complete.
			All participants have entered
			their depositions. Technical
			schematics, and complete records
			from the lab's ground computers,
			as well as Doctor Apgar's personal
			logs, have been included. The
			recreation has a nominal
			eight-point-seven percent margin
			of error.
			Is there anything you'd like to
			say before we begin, Number One?
			Just this. I'm not a murderer.
			I went to the Tanugan lab as an
			official representative of
			Starfleet. And I acted
			accordingly. I was there to
			evaluate Apgar's progress on
			development of a Krieger Wave
			converter. That's all I was
			interested in. Computer. Load
			deposition program, Riker One.
			Run the simulation.
			Doctor Apgar? I'm Commander
			William Riker; Lieutenant
			Commander Geordi La Forge.
			My assistant Tayna... well, let's
			get on with it, shall we?
			Don't be in such a hurry, dear...
			Perhaps our guests would like some
			refreshment...
			My wife, Manua...
			Pleasure to meet you, Mrs.
			Apgar.
			Doctor, if you're prepared to get
			started, so are we...
			Prepared? Of course I'm
			prepared...
			All right... then why don't you
			give me the overview of your
			research while Mister La Forge
			and your assistant look at the
			experimental data...
			Fine. Whatever. I must say,
			Commander, I resent your early
			arrival. Starfleet will get its
			converter... I've had a few
			setbacks, that's all...
			Doctor, we're not here to pressure
			you, we just want an update on
			your progress.
			Tayna -- show the commander's
			assistant whatever he wants to
			see. Give him full access to our
			records.
			If you'll come with me...
			Our Lambda Field generator is on
			the planet since it requires a
			minimum of five thousand kilometers
			for the field to collimate.
			Really, darling, you're being
			rude... after all, Commander Riker
			is willing to sit through all your
			prattle about Krieger Waves...
			Commander, let me get you a
			drink... and we'll hear all about
			Krieger Waves...
			To your success, Doctor.
			... and the rewards that come
			with it.
			Riker -- what is Starfleet doing
			here anyway? My delivery wasn't
			scheduled for another three
			months.
			Actually, we're in this sector
			on another mission... and you had
			asked Starfleet for additional
			dicosilium.... it seemed like a
			good opportunity.
			How interesting. Tell us about
			this other mission.
			It's just a study of a proto-star
			cloud. The Enterprise will be
			returning tomorrow.
			The Enterprise just left you here?
			We have no wish to inconvenience
			you. We've arranged for quarters
			on the planet...
			I won't hear of such a thing.
			Commander, I insist you and Mister
			La Forge stay with us.
			I hardly think --
			I know you'd prefer to be alone
			with your important work... but
			I, for one, am glad for the
			company.
			Good.
			I must apologize for my husband's
			lack of social graces. He may
			be one of the great scientific
			minds in the galaxy... but he
			does come up a bit short in other
			areas.
			Stop.
			computer -- freeze program.
			Then it's your testimony that it
			was Mrs. Apgar's idea for you
			to spend the night aboard the
			station.
			It's my testimony... and it's the
			truth.
			Resume program.
			Our guest quarters aren't
			luxurious... but I've tried to
			make this room warm... and
			inviting.
			I'll be very comfortable, thank
			you. Good night.
			The environmental controls are
			here...
			I'm sure I can find everything
			I need.
			And the door shuts by touching
			this panel.
			Mrs. Apgar...
			This is my sanctuary. Privacy
			is very important on a small
			station. I'm left alone here...
			... often for hours.
			It's late. And I'm tired.
			Are you still tired, Commander?
			Ma'am, excuse me, but I really
			think you ought to leave...
			I knew I'd find you with him.
			Did you think I didn't notice
			how you looked at him? I'm not
			the fool you take me for...
			Doctor...
			Doctor, believe me, this is all
			a terrible mistake...
			You won't get away with this.
			I'll see to it. I swear I will,
			Riker.
			Freeze program.
			I didn't see Doctor Apgar again
			until the following morning when
			he asked to see me alone.
			Commander La Forge returned to
			the Enterprise...
			Resume program.
			I suppose if I make a formal
			complaint, your report on my work
			won't be very good...
			Doctor, this will have no impact
			on my report. It was a
			misunderstanding of the worst
			kind... and I feel I could
			straighten it out if you would
			ask Mrs. Apgar to join us...
			My wife and my assistant have
			transported down to the planet.
			What are you going to put in your
			report, Riker? That there's no
			justification for all the extra
			dicosilium I've requested? That
			is why they sent you early, isn't
			it?
			Doctor...
			I can explain why I needed it.
			They have no idea what my problems
			are... there are explanations for
			all of it...
			I don't need explanations.
			Then we have nothing further to
			say to each other.
			I will tell my captain to expect
			your grievance.
			Do that.
			Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready
			to leave now.
			Stand by, Commander. Engaging
			transport.
			Freeze program.
			And then I returned to the
			Enterprise...
			And there's nothing you'd like to
			add... about firing a phaser,
			Commander?
			I fired no phaser aboard the
			science station.
			That's very odd, Commander. Very
			odd. Captain Picard, isn't it
			true that your sensors picked up
			a power drain just before
			transport?
			That is correct.
			Have you been able to explain it?
			Not to my knowledge.
			We have. Our readings are quite
			clear about it. Information
			retrieved from the lab's ground
			computers show that a focused
			energy pulse was fired just as
			Commander Riker began transport.
			Furthermore, by analyzing the
			trajectory and angle, it is clear
			that it came from the very spot
			that Commander Riker was standing.
			In short, allow me to show you
			my own recreation of the end of
			this story, a speculation if you
			will... computer, play
			hypothetical Krag One.
			Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready
			to leave now.
			Stand by, Commander. Engaging
			transport.
			Freeze program...
			Three seconds later the station
			exploded.
			No question about it, the Tanugans
			are right... something was fired
			at the reactor core just before
			transport...
			The energy signature would seem
			to indicate a phaser-like blast...
			Well, it wasn't the commander's
			phaser. It couldn't be. There's
			gotta be another answer... we're
			just not seeing it yet...
			Was there anything else in the
			lab capable of creating this kind
			of energy discharge... ?
			Nothing I saw. And besides, how
			do you explain that it came from
			Commander's Riker's exact
			position...
			Dammit, I should have stayed with
			him...
			Sensors indicate a radiation burst
			on Deck Thirty-Nine. Outside
			Cargo Bay Twelve.
			Source?
			Unknown.
			Computer identify type of
			radiation.
			Emission is not consistent with
			any known radiation.
			It is subsiding, sir.
			Make any sense to you?
			I don't recognize it. Even the
			main deflector doesn't put out
			that kind of spillage.
			Where would it be coming from...
			I don't know, Wesley... but
			whatever it is, it's capable of
			putting a hole in solid duranium.
			In a sense we've all met Mrs.
			Apgar, so shall we dispense with
			the introductions?
			Mrs. Apgar, do you understand
			the purpose of this hearing?
			We understand how difficult this
			will be for you. If you need a
			recess, please don't hesitate to
			ask.
			Would you like to make a statement
			before we begin?
			No. I just know he did it. He
			killed my husband.
			Load Manua Simulation One.
			Run program.
			If you greet them with such a long
			face they're going to assume
			something is wrong with the
			experiment.
			I just need time... A little more
			time.
			I'm certain they'll give you the
			time you need if you just show
			a little charm.
			You do that so much better than
			I.
			Manua, someday I'll be able to
			reward you... for all your
			patience. I'll get you everything
			you ever dreamed of.
			I have all the reward I need.
			Go on, I'll be right in...
			Doctor Apgar? I'm Commander
			William Riker; Lieutenant
			Commander Geordi La Forge.
			My assistant Tayna... well, let's
			get on with it, shall we?
			Don't be in such a hurry, dear.
			Perhaps our guests would like some
			refreshment...
			My wife, Manua...
			It's a... pleasure... to meet you,
			Manua.
			I'm anxious to get started...
			If you wish.
			I must say I resent your early
			arrival, Commander... I have much
			work to do...
			I'll try to make this as painless
			as possible. For both of us.
			Do you assist your husband in his
			work?
			Oh, dear, no. I'm no scientist.
			Frankly, neither am I.
			But I find this all fascinating,
			don't you?
			Mister La Forge, why don't you
			go over the doctor's experimental
			data...
			Later on, you can give me an
			overview...
			Fine. Whatever. Starfleet will
			get its Krieger Wave converter...
			These things take time. I've had
			a few setbacks, that's all...
			Doctor, I'm not here to put
			pressure on you.
			I'm sure my report will only
			underscore the need for continued
			support of your research.
			Tayna, I'll call up the records...
			show the commander's assistant
			whatever he wants to see.
			If you'll come with me...
			Our field generator is on the
			planet, since it requires a
			minimum of five thousand
			kilometers for the field to
			collimate.
			Darling, let Tayna take care of
			that... I'm sure Commander Riker
			wants to hear how close you are
			to a breakthrough...
			I'll make the two of you a drink
			and you can talk all about Krieger
			Waves...
			To success.
			Success.
			Well, in a way, I suppose it's
			good you're early. Manua's right
			-- it gives me a chance to show
			you the progress we've been
			making.
			I'd appreciate it if Commander
			La Forge and I could stay here
			until the Enterprise returns.
			It's a little inconvenient --
			It might help accelerate the
			process...
			If you wish, Commander...
			Now, where shall I start... well,
			first of all, you should know that
			I'm very close to being able to
			collimate a Krieger field...
			Very... charming.
			It has your touch.
			The station is very small, and
			we don't often have guests. So
			I use this as my sanctuary.
			Who do you need sanctuary from?
			The environmental controls are
			here...
			Commander... it's late and I'm
			tired.
			A husband more interested in
			Krieger Waves than in a woman like
			you... how is it possible...
			My husband is one of the great
			minds in the galaxy... and we love
			each other very much...
			Please... don't...
			It must get very lonely for you
			up here... a princess in a very
			high tower...
			My husband will be looking for
			me...
			Your sanctuary, remember... ?
			She's lying... this never
			happened...
			Freeze program...
			Captain, you know I would never
			act like this.
			Commander Riker...
			This isn't me. I wasn't the one
			who closed the door... I didn't
			proposition her... I certainly
			didn't try to rape her...
			Why are you doing this?
			It's exactly what happened...
			Come on, Will. Sit down.
			Resume program.
			I knew you'd try this, Riker.
			Do you think I didn't notice how
			you looked at her? I'm not the
			fool you take me for...
			You won't get away with this.
			Your career is over. I'll see
			to it. I swear I will, Riker.
			If you report this, you'll be
			making a terrible mistake, Doctor.
			A terrible mistake.
			Freeze program.
			Your career was safe. He was a
			scientist. In another day some
			fascinating bit of technical
			trivia would have distracted him.
			He would have forgotten about you
			and his complaint to Starfleet.
			Excuse me.
			We'll, uh... take a short recess.
			Why would she lie like that... ?
			She was lying. You must have felt
			it.
			Will, I sensed no deception from
			her...
			Then you must think that I...
			No, of course not. I know you.
			You don't have to convince me of
			anything.
			We can't both be telling the
			truth.
			It is the truth... as you each
			remember it.
			Yes, but her version is going to
			put a noose around my neck.
			This is healing beautifully. I
			think you can begin to work on
			strengthening these muscles
			again...
			Security to Doctor Crusher...
			evacuate, repeat evacuate...
			radiation emissions are indicated
			in Sickbay...
			It is definitely the same
			radiation that penetrated deck
			thirty-nine... highly focused,
			very powerful... but of unknown
			origin.
			If this should happen in the
			engine core or the anti-matter
			containment tanks, we'll be in
			trouble, Captain...
			Do you have any theories?
			Data noticed something too strange
			to be a coincidence...
			The two radiation events aboard
			the Enterprise occurred five hours,
			twenty minutes and three seconds
			apart. The science station
			exploded yesterday at almost
			exactly four times that interval.
			There's a point-zero-zero-one-four
			second variance we haven't been
			able to explain yet.
			Are you saying there's a
			connection between the radiation
			bursts and the explosion?
			We do not have the evidence to
			support that conclusion at this
			time, Commander.
			If they're right, we should be
			able to predict the next event...
			We expect it in just over five
			hours.
			Take every precaution you can to
			protect the ship's vital areas...
			if you haven't identified the
			source before the time interval
			is up, we will leave orbit. If you
			perceive any further danger,
			advise me immediately.
			We'll figure it out, Commander.
			Deck eleven.
			Halt.
			Number One...
			I'm not going to try to influence
			your decision, Captain. I know
			you may have to turn me over to
			Krag. I can accept that.
			It hasn't come to that yet.
			But it might... and it's more
			important to me that you know I
			didn't do it.
			If you could just keep your
			trousers buckled... things like
			this wouldn't happen to you...
			I never even gave her a second
			glance...
			Number One, even I gave her a
			second glance.
			Did I ever tell you about the
			mayor's wife in Brussels...
			The one who collected Starfleet
			cadets...
			I did tell you...
			No, you didn't...
			Brussels is lovely this time of
			the year. Isn't it?
			All things considered right now,
			I'd rather be in Brussels.
			As would I, Number One. As would
			I.
			Will, giving you to them would
			be like handing over a part of
			myself.
			Resume.
			After the... the fight, Doctor
			Apgar came to find me... he was
			very upset...
			And he told you what happened?
			Yes, he told me everything that
			happened...
			Based on Tayna's deposition, we
			have reconstructed the incident
			in Commander Riker's quarters as
			Doctor Apgar described it to
			her... computer...
			Inspector, this is hearsay...
			She wasn't a witness to this
			incident...
			Doctor Apgar is dead. Tayna's
			statement is admissible under
			Tanugan law... and I insist you
			consider it.
			We will... watch this evidence.
			And I will weigh it accordingly.
			Computer, run Tayna Simulation
			Three.
			I knew I'd find the two of you
			together. Do you think I didn't
			notice how you were looking at
			each other? I'm not the fool you
			take me for...
			I'm going to report this, Riker.
			You can count on that.
			You're a dead man, Apgar. A dead
			man.
			Freeze program.
			And then Doctor Apgar came to find
			you...
			Run Tayna Simulation Four.
			I want you to take Manua and beam
			down to Tanuga immediately.
			Doctor, if he threatened you, you
			shouldn't stay...
			I'm not leaving him here alone.
			He's capable of anything. I've
			got to protect our work...
			I'll contact the authorities.
			No, I'll take care of that.
			Doctor, be careful...
			It'll be all right. Go on...
			Computer, freeze program.
			What happened next?
			I left the station with Manua.
			The next morning when I heard that
			the station had exploded... I knew
			what had happened. He'd killed
			Doctor Apgar.
			Thank you. You're excused.
			Captain, I have established
			motive, method and opportunity.
			In any court in the Federation,
			it is enough to warrant the
			extradition of the accused. I
			await your decision forthwith.
			I don't see any alternative, do
			you?
			We both know Will is innocent...
			Of course he is. But as a
			Starfleet captain, I don't have
			the luxury of yielding to my
			personal feelings.
			The evidence certainly warrants
			a trial... I will have to allow
			extradition.
			Do you think there's enough
			evidence to prove his innocence?
			Frankly... no.
			Captain, we have discovered the
			source of the radiation... can
			you join us on the bridge?
			Acknowledged.
			Why don't you spend some time with
			Commander Riker...
			I'd like that.
			Captain, as you know, we have been
			looking for a phenomenon that
			reoccurs every five hours, twenty
			minutes and three seconds...
			The interval between radiation
			bursts...
			We have found one such phenomenon
			on the planet's surface.
			It's the field generator that
			Apgar used in his research. When
			it's fully charged, it emits an
			energy pulse and then requires
			five hours, twenty minutes and
			three seconds to recharge itself.
			It must have been left on after
			the explosion of the lab.
			But why would the generator be
			affecting the Enterprise this
			way... ?
			It should not be. It is a
			harmless Lambda Field generator.
			But we knew that somehow it was
			related to our radiation bursts
			... and that's when the pieces
			started falling together...
			We now know what is causing the
			bursts, sir, and why the science
			station exploded.
			We also know who killed Doctor
			Apgar.
			Chief Inspector, we've watched
			the events replayed over and over
			again... I've been impressed...
			and admittedly dismayed... by the
			body of evidence you've prepared
			against Commander Riker.
			But isn't it remarkable that with
			all the witnesses, all the
			different points of view of the
			events aboard the space station...
			that we've never seen what really
			happened at all?
			I don't understand.
			Allow me, with the help of Mister
			La Forge, to explain. computer,
			load Manua Program One, time code
			fourteen-four-one...
			Play program.
			Fine. Whatever. Starfleet will
			get its Krieger Wave converter.
			These things take time. I've had
			a few setbacks, that's all...
			Freeze.
			Mrs. Apgar, this was from your
			deposition. It would suggest that
			your husband had failed to create
			Krieger Waves...
			Yes. But he was very close to
			a breakthrough.
			He says here he needed more
			time... and he was upset by our
			early arrival. In fact, I
			maintain he already had made a
			breakthrough... and that he was
			lying to us...
			On what basis... ?
			For the last several hours, the
			Enterprise has been experiencing
			unusual radiation bursts. We've
			identified them as Krieger Waves.
			Krieger Waves... but that's
			impossible. From where?
			From right here. In the Holodeck.
			We recreated your science lab in
			every conceivable detail... from
			all technical sources available
			including Doctor Apgar's own
			personal records... There is a
			slight margin of error, but
			essentially whatever was in the
			original lab is here...
			Including the Krieger Wave
			converter that Doctor Apgar
			claimed didn't work... except it
			does work.
			Your field generator on the planet
			surface has been sending out
			harmless energy charges... and
			this facsimile has been converting
			them into Krieger Waves.
			But the Holodeck can't create
			anything dangerous...
			It didn't. When you get down to
			basics, the converter is nothing
			more than a complex series of
			mirrors and reflective coils.
			The energy from the field
			generator on the planet simply
			reflects off elements in the
			convertor which turns it into
			highly focused Krieger Waves...
			And those waves have been randomly
			striking different areas of our
			ship as we orbit the planet and
			our angle to the generator
			changes.
			Why would Apgar lie about his own
			success... ?
			Computer, run Manua Program One,
			time code, fourteen three-eight.
			Manua, someday I'll reward you
			for all your patience. I'll get
			you everything you ever dreamed
			of.
			I have all the reward I need.
			Freeze.
			Run Riker Program Two, time code,
			sixteen-one-zero.
			To your success, doctor.
			And the rewards that come with
			it.
			Freeze.
			I never said that.
			Nevertheless, it seems clear that
			your husband was motivated to earn
			the kind of rewards that would
			please you, Mrs. Apgar.
			What's wrong with that?
			He wouldn't have earned great
			profits from his dealings with
			Starfleet... We were only
			interested in a new power
			source...
			But if he could turn this into
			a weapon... it would be worth a
			lot to the Ferengi or the
			Romulans or a few others. Doctor
			Apgar had been ordering extra
			dicosilium for months... that's
			a pretty good indication he was
			trying to create larger reflective
			coils.
			When the away team arrived early
			he must have been worried that
			Starfleet was getting suspicious.
			He needed more time to finish his
			work. Apgar said that in all
			three versions. No doubt, he was
			afraid that Commander Riker might
			learn the truth and cut off his
			support prematurely.
			Discovering Commander Riker with
			his wife did not improve matters.
			And, I submit, that he decided
			to murder Commander Riker.
			Ridiculous.
			Is it? Computer, run Tayna
			Program Four, time code
			eighteen-one-four.
			I'll contact the authorities.
			No, I'll take care of that.
			Freeze.
			Tayna, what is it that he's doing
			here... ?
			Activating the generator on the
			planet.
			Why would he do that?
			Maybe he was going to work on the
			converter, I don't know.
			Or he might have already been
			thinking ahead to his next
			confrontation with Commander
			Riker... Computer, play Riker
			Program Four, time code twenty-four-one.
			What are you going to put in your
			report, Riker? That there's no
			justification for all the extra
			discosilium I've requested? That
			is why they sent you early, isn't
			it?
			Doctor...
			I can explain why I needed it.
			They have no idea what my problems
			are... there are explanations for
			all of it...
			I don't need explanations.
			Freeze.
			To Apgar, that must have seemed
			as though Commander Riker was
			confirming his worst fears. And I
			believe this is when Apgar decided
			finally to kill him.
			You forget, Picard... we know the
			energy pulse which blew up the
			reactor was fired from Commander
			Riker's position not Doctor
			Apgar's.
			We are hypothesizing that Doctor
			Apgar energized the converter at
			the moment of Commander Riker's
			beam-out hoping to make his death
			look like a transporter accident.
			But something went wrong... the
			energy pulse hit the Transporter
			beam and reflected back to the
			lab's reactor which caused the
			explosion.
			An interesting hypothesis. But
			impossible to prove.
			Not really. We know that the
			field generator on the planet
			has been repeating a discharge
			command ever since the explosion.
			The intervals are like
			clockwork... except the explosion
			occurred point-zero-zero-one-four
			seconds after the first
			discharge... the only explanation
			for that variance is the time it
			would take the energy pulse to
			bounce back from the transporter
			beam to the reactor.
			I haven't the slightest idea what
			anyone's talking about.
			Nor should you, Mrs. Apgar.
			We have arranged a demonstration
			to illustrate. Mister La Forge,
			I believe it is almost time is
			it not?
			Computer, load program, La Forge
			One... coordinate auto-engage time
			sequence.
			The next discharge from the field
			generator is scheduled to occur
			in a few moments. We have aligned
			the Holodeck program to recreate
			the final events as Commander
			Riker described them... only this
			time our facsimile will
			automatically process the energy
			charge from the planet and reflect
			it just as the original convertor
			did before the explosion.
			If we're correct, we'll know it
			instantly.
			I will tell my captain to expect
			your grievance.
			Do that.
			Riker to Enterprise. I'm ready
			to leave now.
			Stand by, Commander. Engaging
			transport.
			Doctor Apgar killed himself...
			during his attempt to kill
			Commander Riker.
			Captain... I withdraw my request
			for Commander Riker's extradition.
			Well, Number One... have we any
			"further business" in the Tanuga
			system?
			Not that I know of, sir. I'm more
			than willing to put it behind me.
			Then perhaps you'd be so good as
			to get this ship underway?
			With pleasure, sir.
			Mister Crusher, set a course for
			Emila-Two.
			Course laid in, sir.
			Engage.
