			Captain's Log, Stardate 43957.2.
			We are presently charting an
			unknown star system located in
			the Zeta Gelis cluster. This
			rather routine assignment has made
			for a refreshingly quiet time
			aboard the Enterprise.
			That's her.
			Don't stare.
			Why not?
			Because she'll see.
			Good. You must let her see the
			fire in your eyes.
			But what would I say... ?
			Words come later, it is the scent
			that first speaks of love.
			Thanks Worf, that really helps
			me a lot.
			Hi, Geordi.
			Hi, Christy.
			So... how have you been?
			Good.
			How are things down in
			Engineering?
			Fine... uh really... fine.
			Well, see you around.
			I have much to teach you about
			women.
			Mister La Forge, report to
			Transporter Room three.
			What's this all about, Commander?
			Sensors have discovered a small
			one-man ship crashed on the
			planet.
			We're picked up life-signs...
			humanoid, very faint and fading.
			Radiation levels within acceptable
			limits.
			We can beam him out from under
			there, get him up to Sickbay.
			He's not stable enough for
			transport. There's damage to his
			brain stem, his autonomic
			functions are failing.
			His heart needs active neural
			feedback, it can't regulate
			itself. I need a volunteer.
			I'm here.
			I'm going to hook your nervous
			systems together through my
			tricorder -- your brain will
			regulate both systems. That
			should stabilize him long enough
			to get him up to the ship.
			Take deep, regular breaths. If
			anything goes wrong I'll break
			the connection.
			Geordi!
			I'm fine... no problem.
			Transporter Room, three to beam
			directly to Sickbay.
			Autonomic responses are still
			low... begin cardiostimulation...
			Sixty cc's of inoprovaline...
			massive infection is setting in...
			use the protodynoplaser to
			stabilize his immune system.
			We need to design a virus that
			can infiltrate his cell structure
			and boost his ATP production.
			What about Commander La Forge...
			he's waiting in the diagnostic
			center.
			I want you to give him a full
			bioscan. See if there are any
			residual effects from that energy
			discharge during the neuro-link.
			Keep his arm in cryogenic stasis
			until his vital signs are strong
			enough to begin surgical
			procedures.
			From the size and shape of the
			wreckage, it appeared to be some
			kind of escape pod. The control
			system had been heavily damaged,
			that's probably what caused the
			crash.
			An escape pod... then it couldn't
			have travelled very far. Mister
			Data, any signs of other ships
			in this area?
			I am picking up a scattering of
			debris in extended orbit around
			the planet. It reads as refined
			metals and other synthetic
			compounds.
			The remains of a larger vessel.
			He must have left in the pod
			before the ship was destroyed.
			Sensors show trace elements in
			the debris that would indicate
			phaser fire was recently
			exchanged.
			Were you able to salvage anything
			from the escape pod?
			This is all that is left of the
			pod's computer system.
			Can you access it?
			It will take time. Downloading
			it into our system will require
			fabrication of a matrix translator
			to emulate the alien's computer
			system.
			Keep me apprised of your progress.
			Aye, sir.
			Limb re-fusion appears to have
			been successful, Doctor.
			Tissue oxygenation is within
			norms.
			That's all we can do for now.
			We won't be able to test
			neuromuscular function for a few
			days.
			Can I go now, Doc?
			No need to keep you here. Your
			bioscan came out negative.
			I could have told you that. I
			feel great.
			How's your patient, Beverly?
			I never thought he'd make it this
			far. There was major trauma to
			the head and chest cavity, massive
			plasma loss, and severe damage
			to most of his organs.
			What are his chances?
			I believe he'll live... but I'm
			afraid I can't take the credit
			for it. His body is showing
			amazing recuperative powers. The
			damaged tissue is repairing itself
			at a phenomenal rate.
			There's only one thing that
			troubles me.
			Go on.
			Take a look at this.
			Cell regeneration?
			Yes... the thing is that it has
			nothing to do with his injuries.
			These are undamaged cells, but
			they seem to be mutating.
			Any theory as to what's causing
			it?
			No. I've never seen anything like
			it. It's possible this could be
			part of his natural healing
			process. I hope it is... because
			there's nothing I can do to stop
			it.
			I'm telling you Data, there's got
			to be some way to decode the
			information in this thing.
			I agree Geordi. But the data
			matrix within the capsule does
			not correspond to any standard
			format. All we have been able
			to determine is that the device
			uses a chemically based system
			for molecular energy encoding.
			Yeah, and the computer still
			can't analyze the specific
			chemical elements involved. It's
			got to be part of the data
			processing system...
			What if it's a feedback loop
			controller?
			The compact shape does suggest
			a rapid chemical processing and
			storage capacity.
			We found it close to the escape
			pod instrumentation assemblage...
			this capsule might process the
			ship's dynamic motions and augment
			the manual control inputs.
			We could send it a few test
			signals... make it think the
			entire assemblage was awake and
			operating.
			An intriguing experiment. The
			capsule might provide us with
			information without the need to
			decode the storage medium itself.
			Perhaps we could examine your
			theory immediately.
			Less talk, more synthehol.
			We came here to relax.
			I am relaxed. In fact, I've never
			felt better.
			But you know, Worf you do have
			a point.
			I think the storage capsule can
			wait awhile.
			Hi. Not leaving, are you?
			Oh hi, Geordi... I was just on
			my way down to the arboretum.
			Care for some company?
			I'd love some. But I didn't think
			you were interested... in that
			kind of thing.
			There are a lot of things you
			don't know about me.
			I have been tutoring him.
			He learns quickly.
			Medical Log, Stardate 43958.8.
			I have removed patient "John Doe"
			from the emergency bio-support
			unit. In just thirty-six hours
			most of his major organ systems
			have regenerated themselves to
			the point where they can now
			function on their own.
			I am... alive.
			You certainly are.
			Thank you... for my life. Tell
			me... who am I?
			Captain's Log: Stardate 43960.6.
			Our mission to map the Zeta Gelis
			star cluster is proceeding on
			schedule. Meanwhile, Doctor
			Crusher reports that the recovery
			of the patient she has named John
			Doe continues at a remarkable
			pace.
			Are you experiencing any
			discomfort?
			None. I can feel the life
			returning to my body.
			Your neurofibrowaves are
			functioning almost normally again.
			That puts you... about six weeks
			ahead of my original schedule.
			That should give you and your
			colleagues something to talk
			about.
			You're all we've talked about
			since your arrival.
			I believe I'm ready for the next
			phase of my treatment.
			You're right... I think it's time
			you stopped taking up valuable
			bedspace.
			Now remember... you've been off
			your feet for almost a month.
			These motor assist bands will
			provide electrical stimulation
			to your arms and legs. They'll
			help you re-learn to control your
			muscles.
			Now, don't be disappointed if your
			mobility is restricted at first...
			your limbs are still weak.
			I appreciate your concern Doctor.
			But I think I'm going to surprise
			you again. I feel strong enough
			to fly.
			But perhaps I should concentrate
			on walking first.
			Let's try again. But this time...
			a little more slowly.
			Much more slowly.
			I envy your reflexes, Captain.
			And I envy your strength of will.
			Doctor Crusher has kept me
			informed of your progress. It's
			quite extraordinary.
			I have an extraordinary doctor.
			She gave me back my life. I hope
			that I'm worthy of her efforts.
			Tell me John, are you still unable
			to recall anything at all about
			your past?
			No... my memories begin the moment
			I woke up in Sickbay.
			Doctor Crusher told me... you
			think I was in some kind of
			battle.
			We're quite certain of that. But
			you have no idea how you came to
			be in that escape pod, or what
			happened to your ship?
			No. Believe me, Captain it's a
			horrible feeling. Not knowing
			who you are, where you're from...
			Have you tried synaptic
			induction?
			His neural nets don't conform
			to any known patterns.
			Conventional neurotherapy has
			proven ineffective. Hopefully,
			in time, his memory pathways will
			reestablish themselves naturally.
			That same pain again?
			Yes.
			I think I've made enough progress
			for one day.
			Not a relapse I hope.
			This has nothing to do with his
			wounds. I think it's related
			to the continuing mutation of his
			cell structure.
			Still no theory as to what's
			causing it?
			None. I've run every test I could
			think of... it just doesn't make
			any sense.
			I seem to be a mystery, Doctor.
			To you... and to myself.
			This is where I get off. See you
			tonight in Ten Forward?
			I'll be there.
			Hello Commander.
			Miss Henshaw.
			Bridge.
			Deck six.
			So... you and Miss Henshaw have
			certainly been seeing a lot of
			each other.
			Every night this week.
			Is that all? Seems like you've
			been walking around with a smile
			on your face for a lot longer than
			that.
			I guess I have. This last month
			or so... everything seems to be
			going my way.
			I don't know what it is, but
			something's changed around here.
			The only thing that's changed is
			you.
			Me? I'm the same guy I've always
			been.
			If you say so... but I don't
			remember the old Geordi having
			much success with Christy Henshaw.
			Maybe I am a little more confident
			than I used to be.
			What happened to you?
			I was... uh... kayaking on the
			Holodeck again.
			And now you've dislocated your
			shoulder. Sit down, I'll get the
			osteotractor frame.
			Hi mom. We still on for dinner
			tonight?
			Seven-thirty sharp. I'll be right
			back.
			Kayaking again?
			So how's my mom's favorite
			patient?
			Judge for yourself.
			Hey... not bad.
			Your mother promised me a tour
			of the ship tomorrow.
			You may find this hard to believe,
			but Sickbay can be an incredibly
			boring place.
			Hey Doc... I'm dying here.
			Don't worry my friend... you'll
			be alright.
			The pain's gone.
			It's completely healed. I don't
			understand... what did you do,
			John?
			I... don't know. It was...
			instinct.
			I just... touched him.
			I've run every test and scan that
			I can think of... there's no
			physiological evidence that would
			indicate he would possess such
			powers. But then, there's so much
			about John that's a mystery...
			You know... I really like him.
			He does have a certain charm
			doesn't he? The whole medical
			staff has commented on it.
			You seem pretty taken with him
			yourself.
			I guess I am... taken with him.
			There's a strength and serenity
			about him that's very attractive.
			Yet, he's filled with such pain
			and turmoil... he's so
			vulnerable. I find him... very
			intriguing.
			Sounds like there's more to it
			than that.
			Is that your way of asking if I'm
			getting romantically involved with
			him?
			You said it, I didn't.
			My feelings toward him aren't
			romantic... exactly. I mean...
			I know that the... doctor/patient
			relationship can sometimes create
			a... false sense of intimacy...
			but this is different. There's
			an almost... spiritual connection.
			I guess I'm not making much sense,
			am I?
			I think I understand.
			Data, I was thinking about the
			storage capsule last night.
			And I was wondering... what if
			we've been going about it the
			wrong way. We've been trying to
			analyze its mechanical properties.
			What if it is a biochemical
			storage medium?
			Are you suggesting that it
			employes memory RNA like an
			organic cell?
			Well, it does contain quantities
			of nucleic acids.
			Perhaps the information sequences
			are encoded in the molecular
			patterns themselves.
			Computer, scan the storage
			capsule. Analyze molecular
			sequences on nucleic acid chains.
			Well what do you know. A
			navigational chart.
			It appears that your hypothesis
			was correct, Geordi.
			I knew it.
			Captain?
			You found something?
			We have determined that the
			storage cube from John Doe's
			escape pod contains navigational
			information.
			Can you match these stars to our
			charts?
			Computer, run transformational
			matrix calculations. Match
			navigational referents to known
			stars in this sector.
			Information on this sector is
			incomplete. No correlation.
			I'm not giving up yet. Not after
			coming so close to cracking this
			thing.
			That might be flight path
			information from John's ship, but
			without a frame of reference, I
			can't determine the origin points.
			Computer, assume those points are
			course corrections and derive
			gravitational values for stellar
			objects near the flight path.
			Most of these are ordinary G-type
			stars...
			But this would appear to be a
			neutron star, possibly a pulsar.
			Which means this might be a
			rotational time reference.
			Computer, assume these symbols
			are pulsars. Translate associated
			values into standard temporal
			notations.
			Computer, is there a pulsar with
			a rotational period of...
			one-point-five-two-four-four
			seconds within sensor range?
			Affirmative.
			Bingo! Overlay navigational chart
			using referenced pulsars and
			project a flight path back to
			origin.
			Flight path originated at bearing
			zero-zero-three, mark
			zero-one-five. Distance,
			two-point-three parsecs.
			That's it, Captain. That's where
			John Doe came from.
			That bearing is almost directly
			along our planned course.
			Good. Then we can continue our
			mission without significant
			interruption.
			Home?
			Yes... using the information we
			found in your escape pod, we may
			be able to return you to your
			people.
			I... cannot go back.
			And why is that?
			You must not take me home,
			Captain.
			John, your memory... has it
			returned?
			All I know is that we came out
			here to escape.
			Escape what?
			There were others with you?
			Yes... I was not... alone. But
			what happened to the others or
			what we were escaping from... I
			cannot remember.
			But I do know that I cannot go
			back... not yet.
			We will not arrive in your star
			system for at least three weeks.
			That gives us plenty of time to
			discuss this matter further.
			Hopefully by then, you'll have
			regained more of your memory.
			You're right of course. I
			apologize for my outburst,
			Captain.
			It is... understandable.
			This ship is astounding. It seems
			to stretch on without end.
			We can see the rest of it some
			other time. This is your first
			day out of Sickbay... I don't want
			you to overexert yourself.
			This looks like an ideal place
			to rest.
			My thoughts exactly.
			Truly remarkable.
			What is?
			These people... they're all so
			different from one another... yet
			they work together freely.
			Is it that surprising?
			It is... new to me.
			My people are different...
			somehow. If only I could
			remember!
			Yesterday... for one terrifying
			moment, there was clarity.
			You mean that energy pulse... ?
			Yes. For that moment, my purpose
			seemed clear... but then it was
			gone.
			The pain... the energy pulse...
			they must all be linked to the
			cell mutation in your body.
			I wish there was some way I could
			help you get to the truth.
			Thank you... Beverly, you've done
			so much for me already. I only
			wish there was some way I could
			repay you.
			But you have...
			The... friendship... that we've
			developed has made me... very
			happy.
			The rapport that exists between
			us... also means a great deal
			to me.
			But I believe that I am on some
			kind of journey. Whatever brought
			me here... whatever is happening
			to my body... it's all part of
			that journey... and I must
			complete it... before any other
			consideration.
			Sir, I am reading a vessel on
			long-range scanners... it is
			coming from sector nine five six
			nine.
			What configuration?
			Impossible to identify at this
			distance. However, it is on an
			intercept course.
			Captain, the ship is traveling
			at warp nine point seven two.
			Nine point seven two?
			Time to intercept?
			At present course and speed...
			ten hours fifty-three minutes.
			Try to hail them, Mister Worf.
			No response, Captain.
			Monitor their approach... repeat
			hail every half hour.
			Aye sir.
			Whoever they are, they're in a
			big hurry to get here.
			Doctor Crusher, medical emergency,
			room four.
			Can't... make it... stop...
			John tell me... is it worse than
			before?
			Much... worse.
			Should I get something for the
			pain?
			No. The readings are fluctuating
			too wildly... it wouldn't do any
			good, his entire cell structure...
			is transforming.
			Beverly! I have to... leave!
			Where do you want to go?
			I must... get off... this ship.
			John, that's impossible. In your
			condition---
			I must... !
			Security...
			Okay, let's realign the magnetic
			inducers on the starboard nacelle.
			John!
			Leave the control booth
			immediately!
			John! Listen to me! You must
			come down!
			Step away from the controls.
			Get back! Please... stay away!
			I have no wish to harm you... but
			you must return to Sickbay
			immediately.
			No! Do not come any closer! I
			have no control over what's
			happening to me.
			His neck is broken. No life
			signs.
			Sickbay, form a resuscitation
			team, we have a code seven in
			shuttle bay two. Transporter
			room, standby...
			No... don't.
			There's no trace of injury.
			You admit you were trying to steal
			a shuttlecraft.
			Yes.
			So I ask you again -- why?
			I don't know!
			Unacceptable. You had a reason
			-- I want to know what it was.
			Dammit, I'm entitled to an answer.
			You nearly killed a member of
			my crew.
			And healed him.
			I am not forgetting that. It's
			the only reason he's here, and
			not in the brig.
			I warned him... told him it was
			dangerous.
			Why? Why is it dangerous? What
			is happening to you?
			I don't know.
			The rate of metamorphosis is
			accelerating. Almost as if your
			body were generating an
			electrical field that's warping
			the tissue.
			I can't explain what I don't
			understand.
			Who are you? What are you?
			I am afraid... for myself...
			for all of you. I have to get
			away... isolate myself. Whatever
			is happening to me, it's
			dangerous.
			As Lieutenant Worf discovered.
			I don't want to hurt anyone.
			Captain, for the sake of your
			crew, let me go before it happens
			again.
			John, I can't believe you're
			capable of harming any --
			Captain, the alien vessel is
			coming within weapons range. Its
			shields are up.
			On my way.
			Take him back to Sickbay. I want
			him under constant surveillance.
			I want to thank you.
			For what?
			I don't know how -- or why --
			but down on the planet, you gave
			me something... a new confidence.
			I doubt I can take credit for
			that... Perhaps I only helped
			you find something you already
			had.
			Alien vessel approaching at
			half-impulse, heading zero-five-one
			mark one-one-four.
			Raise shields. Slow to one-third
			impulse and bring us to
			one-zero-three mark zero-two-five.
			Mister Worf, hail the alien
			vessel.
			They continue to ignore our hails,
			sir.
			They are scanning us, Captain.
			They are answering our hail,
			Captain.
			On screen.
			You know him?
			Yes... I don't know how, but...
			He's dangerous...
			I am Commander Sunad, of Zalkon.
			You are trespassing into our
			space... and you are holding a
			Zalkonian citizen.
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of
			the United Federation of Planets.
			We intend no transgression of --
			You will return him to us
			immediately.
			Sunad -- this individual is our
			guest. We found him dying in a
			shipwreck and returned him to
			health.
			Then you have aided a criminal.
			He is one of four escaped
			prisoners. We eliminated the
			other three.
			We thought this one dead as well.
			Return him so we may complete our
			task.
			Of what is he accused?
			He is a disruptive influence.
			He spreads lies... encourages
			dissent... disturbs the natural
			order of our society.
			In what way?
			That is not your concern.
			I will give you two hours to
			comply.
			Tactical analysis.
			The Zalkonian ship has a
			formidable armament. Their
			weaponry is comparable to ours.
			They're just as fast -- and
			probably just as maneuverable.
			Counselor. Do they mean to carry
			out their threat?
			I believe so. Sunad's hatred for
			John was evident... but there's
			something else. The Zalkonians
			fear John.
			Commander Riker, Counselor,
			Doctor. John, I'd like you to
			join us.
			Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
			Mister Worf -- stay at Tactical.
			Counter any moves the Zalkonian
			makes.
			Aye, sir.
			I can neither confirm nor deny
			what the Zalkonians told you.
			They make serious accusations
			against you...
			Their accusations may be true.
			I don't know. I don't believe
			I am a criminal...
			You understand the difficult
			position in which I'm placed.
			Completely. And I refuse to place
			your ship in danger. If
			necessary, I'll surrender to them.
			But I'm convinced there's more
			at stake here than my life...
			there's something... important
			I must complete... my survival
			is vital.
			If I could explain it, I would...
			I'll inform you of my decision
			shortly.
			Captain, you can't seriously be
			considering --
			We must consider all options,
			Doctor, without letting our
			personal feelings impede our
			judgment.
			You're going to tell me it's
			irrelevant that we'd be sending
			him to his death...
			Exactly. Whether we approve of
			the Zalkonians' motives is not
			at issue.
			For what it's worth, I suspect
			John may be correct that his
			existence has broader
			ramifications than that of a
			simple criminal.
			Sunad thinks so. He feels
			personally threatened by John.
			Sunad called John a "disruptive
			influence." That's hardly a
			capital offense --
			It is not up to us to judge their
			laws, Doctor.
			I know how I'd feel if the
			situation were reversed... if they
			were in our territory, holding
			a Federation citizen.
			The Zalkonians truly don't
			understand our indecision about
			returning John. In their eyes,
			we shouldn't be involved.
			We are involved. I saved his
			life. For what? So they could
			chase him down and take that life
			away?
			Picard -- we will not tolerate
			more delays.
			Commander, let me remind you we
			are on a mission of exploration...
			our purpose is to establish
			peaceful relations with the
			civilizations we encounter.
			We do not want relations with you.
			If that is your wish -- we will
			respect it.
			We simply want you to leave
			Zalkonian space as soon as you
			return the criminal.
			Commander, we will leave. It is
			not our policy to intervene in
			the affairs of other cultures.
			But before I return the survivor
			to you, I would appreciate a more
			detailed explanation of what he
			has done to merit a death
			sentence.
			As I said -- it is not your
			concern.
			Agreed. However, there are
			circumstances of which you may
			be unaware. The survivor has
			suffered a memory loss -- he is,
			therefore, ill-equipped to defend
			himself against your accusations.
			There is no defense. Our judgment
			is final.
			Since his recovery, he has
			manifested unusual abilities --
			What kind of abilities?
			He apparently has the power to
			heal injuries with a simple
			touch...
			Lies!
			-- and even to reverse death
			itself --
			Obviously he has corrupted you
			as well. I see I am wasting my
			time --
			Shields ineffective...
			I can't... breathe...
			It's come back to me, Beverly...
			I know who I am -- what I am.
			Ready all weapons.
			That will be futile. You will
			no longer harm these people,
			Sunad.
			Fire upon that ship...
			I won't hurt you.
			Kill him, Captain -- he's evil...
			You could learn from these people,
			Sunad. They don't fear me.
			They don't realize how dangerous
			you are -- you and the others like
			you...
			That's what you and the other
			leaders have maintained for
			generations. But it's a lie.
			Captain -- my species is on the
			verge of a wondrous evolutionary
			change... a transmutation beyond
			our physical being. I am the
			first of my kind to approach that
			metamorphosis.
			They tried to convince us it was
			a sickness we'd never survive...
			that the pain and energy pulses
			would kill us. They claimed we
			were dangerous... so they
			destroyed anyone who exhibited
			signs of the transfiguration.
			We were protecting our society...
			By murdering us?
			You saw the mutations as a threat
			to your authority... you were
			terrified of something you
			couldn't understand.
			Some suspected that what was
			happening to them was not evil.
			Four of us decided to flee Zalkon
			and let the metamorphosis take
			its course.
			You hunted us down... killed the
			others. But I survived...
			... with the help of a kind and
			friendly people.
			There is nothing to fear. You
			can join me. All Zalkonians can.
			Let me show you.
			Don't touch me!
			As you wish. But others will
			listen... now that you can no
			longer prevent me from telling
			them the truth. Those who are
			willing will follow me.
			Sunad is back aboard the Zalkonian
			vessel, Captain...
			Captain... my people are about
			to embark upon a new realm, a new
			plane of existence... thanks to
			you.
			It is our mission to seek out
			life... in all its forms. We
			are privileged to have been
			present at the emergence of a new
