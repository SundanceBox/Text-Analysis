			I don't want any trouble,
			Barlcay...
			Trouble? Why would there be
			trouble?
			There's always trouble when you
			come in here.
			You're on duty, Lieutenant.
			Is that a fact?
			It is, and you'll observe it.
			Get back to your post.
			Look, pal. Do me a favor. Take
			yourself and your holier-than-thou
			attitude and get out of my life.
			This is insubordination, Mister
			Barclay.
			So punish me.
			Security to Ten-Forward!
			"Insubordination."
			Riker, you're nothing but a pretty
			mannequin dressed up in a fancy
			uniform. You're full of hot air,
			and if Picard has a problem with
			me, he can come and tell me
			himself...
			I feel your confidence, your
			arrogant resolve. It excites me.
			Lieutenant Barclay, report to
			Cargo Bay Five now.
			This will have to wait, darling.
			Um... Be right there.
			Freeze program. Exit.
			Save program.
			I just don't know what to do with
			him. He's always late, never
			gives his best effort, always
			slides by... I can't deal with
			it anymore. How does a guy like
			him ever make it through the
			Academy...
			I think it's time we talked to
			the captain about Broccoli.
			That's what Wesley calls him.
			Keep it to yourself.
			It fits.
			A broken seal, Commander.
			You better destroy it. Those
			samples will be tainted.
			Is it a problem for you to report
			to duty on time, Lieutenant?
			Problem? Nossir. I'm... I'm very
			sorry, sir... it's just... I had
			a very important communique...
			it required my immediate response
			and...
			I don't want to hear it... we're
			having intermittent problems with
			the anti-grav unit, see what you
			can do...
			Mister Barclay, I'm tired of
			seeing your name on report.
			I don't know what you got away
			with on your last posting, but
			this is the Enterprise. We set
			a different standard here.
			Understood?
			Understood... sir.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43807.4.
			We are taking on a load of special
			tissue samples donated by the
			Mikulaks for shipment to Nahmi
			Four. The samples could prove
			vital to the containment of an
			outbreak of Correllium Fever on
			that world.
			Everything looks... it looks
			normal to me...
			Dammit..
			I... I don't understand...
			La Forge to Engineering... I'll
			need more people in Cargo Bay
			Five... anyone you can spare.
			Out.
			We could use a hand, Mister
			Barclay...
			I'll... I'll disassemble it later,
			Commander... it shouldn't do
			that... well, of course, it
			shouldn't do that... I mean...
			well, it shouldn't do that.
			I'm not accustomed to seeing an
			unsatisfactory rating for one of
			my crew.
			I guess the issue is whether
			Mister Barclay is Enterprise
			material.
			I assume from your request for
			his transfer that you don't think
			he is, Commander...
			I hate to say it... I always
			thought I could work with
			anyone... but I just can't stand
			the guy. Broccoli makes me
			nervous... he makes everyone
			nervous...
			Broccoli?
			Young Mister Crusher started it.
			I'm afraid it's caught on.
			Let's get it uncaught, shall we?
			By all indications, Barclay has
			served honorably in Starfleet for
			many years. His rating aboard
			the Zhukov was satisfactory...
			I recall Captain Gleason speaking
			quite highly of him before his
			transfer...
			In retrospect, I wonder if Captain
			Gleason wasn't buttering our bread
			a little...
			He knew we were looking for a
			diagnostic engineer.
			I've reviewed Barclay's
			psychological profile. He's
			always had seclusive tendencies...
			it was noted at the Academy more
			than once...
			And yet he chose this way of life;
			he's made the same commitment to
			Starfleet that we all have...
			It's easy to transfer our problem
			to someone else. Too easy.
			Captain, it's not like I haven't
			tried...
			Try harder.
			He's on your team. Manage him.
			Pull him in. Find ways to help
			him make a positive contribution.
			Get to know the man. Make him
			your best friend.
			With all respect, sir... my best
			friend? I can barely tolerate
			being in the same room with the
			man...
			I suggest you put your personal
			discomfort with him aside,
			Commander. Dismissed.
			My best friend.
			Hey, Reg...
			Uh, how's it going?
			Oh, it's... I still haven't traced
			the problem, Commander...
			That's okay. No rush. Take your
			time.
			I've... I've been planning to run
			diagnostics on the graviton
			invertor circuits...
			Smart plan... well, I'd say we're
			in good hands here...
			I'll get a preliminary report to
			you...
			...whenever.
			Before the end of the day.
			Fine. And say, Reg, how about
			sitting in on the mission briefing
			with my senior officers in the
			morning...
			The briefing? Me?
			I'd just like your input...
			On what? I mean, should I prepare
			something...
			No... no... just be there. Eight
			hundred hours.
			I'll be on time, sir.
			Good.
			Morning. Start your brains, and
			let's do it.
			Okay, this trip to Nahmi Four is
			pretty routine. We'll have plenty
			of time to realign the magnetic
			capacitors in both the matter and
			anti-matter injectors.
			Duffy, Costa, that'll be your
			assignment.
			We probably ought to do the flow
			regulator maintenance at the same
			time, Commander.
			Good idea.
			Ensign Crusher is putting in some
			hours with us this week as part
			of his training duties... he'll
			be assigned to assist you, Mister
			Myers. Be sure and teach him the
			difference between impulse and
			warp drive.
			Lieutenant Barclay is working on
			the mystery of the anti-grav
			failure we had yesterday... your
			preliminary report had a couple
			of interesting theories, Reg...
			Why don't you summarize your
			findings so far, Reg...
			Yes.
			It wasn't a maintenance problem...
			everything checked out. I...
			I'm going to check for... a surge
			in... the transfer coils.
			A coil surge wouldn't have
			resulted in a field dissipation.
			I... I... I realize that...
			But we shouldn't ignore the
			possibility, Wes...
			You ought to take a look at the
			flow capacitor. That could
			have forced a chain collapse of
			the antigrav field.
			I... was going to.
			Good. Okay, then... let's go over
			the realignment procedure...
			I just didn't know what to say.
			What do you wish you had said?
			I should have told him to mind
			his own damned business... I knew
			about the flow capacitor... I
			didn't need to hear about it from
			a seventeen year old kid.
			You're letting it get you much
			too upset.
			You think so?
			Why are you so hard on yourself?
			You don't know... it's hard out
			there.
			I understand, but let go of it.
			You're here now.
			You're right, of course.
			Of course.
			Let me help you relax.
			I'd like that.
			I knew you would.
			Mmm, nice... but I'm in the mood
			for someplace a little more...
			unusual...
			Computer. Run Barclay Program
			Fifteen.
			I am the Goddess of Empathy. Cast
			off your inhibitions and embrace
			love, truth, joy...
			But I thought that's the point
			of the briefing... to discuss
			different approaches...
			I'm not saying you did anything
			wrong, Wes... it's just that
			Barclay's... well, my new
			project.
			Yeah, Broccoli's a real project
			all right...
			I just gotta draw him out more...
			And I shut him down.
			Poor Broccoli.
			Pardon me, but why is Lieutenant
			Barclay being referred to
			clandestinely as a vegetable?
			It's a joke, Data... you know,
			a nickname.
			Nicknames generally denote
			fondness, a diminutive shared
			between friends. This does not
			sound friendly.
			Data's absolutely right. The
			nickname stops here and now.
			Captain's orders.
			What the hell... ?
			What happened to your glass?
			Nucleo-synthesis. The structure
			of the glass has been altered at
			the atomic level.
			A problem with the replicator?
			Unlikely. A problem with the
			replicator would have affected
			the contents as well as the glass.
			But the liquid in the glass was
			a perfect replication of a dark
			ale of Earth origin which I
			believe is what Lieutenant Duffy
			ordered.
			I can't detect any residual
			radiation or unusual chemical
			compounds that would have caused
			this.
			The most probable explanation is
			that the glass came into contact
			with an unshielded power source.
			That means a complete diagnostic
			check of the Enterprise power
			systems. All four thousand of
			them.
			Have I got the man for this job...
			Hey, Reg...
			Busy?
			Well, I was just... no, not
			really... what?
			Got another mystery for you...
			somehow the molecular structure
			of this cup from Ten-Forward has
			been altered...
			Mister Barclay is the Sherlock
			Holmes of the technical support
			crew...
			A fascinating vocation, Mister
			Barclay. I am a student of
			Sherlock Holmes mysteries and I
			would enjoy discussing some of
			your cases at your leisure.
			My cases... ?
			Uh, Reg, we're gonna have to run
			through the power systems, to see
			if there's some kind of leak that
			caused this.
			I had to... I was going to do it
			anyway...
			You were?
			To... to try and explain the
			anti-grav unit failure... I still
			can't... nothing about it makes
			sense.
			Then it is possible these two very
			disparate incidents could be
			related.
			I wouldn't bother you with
			something this minor, Commander...
			but it may be a symptom of a more
			serious problem...
			You think we'll need to put in
			to a starbase?
			We'll have a better idea after
			Mister Barclay runs a check of
			the power systems...
			It was Lieutenant Barclay who
			first suggested the link between
			the two incidents, sir.
			No, it wasn't. Not really.
			Will your investigation affect
			our available power during the
			mission, Lieutenant?
			No... nossir... we'll have to shut
			off some systems... they'll be
			down a few at a time... it
			shouldn't... I don't think so.
			Good. I look forward to your
			report, Mister Broccoli.
			Barclay.
			If you'll excuse me.
			Metathesis is one of the most
			common of pronunciation errors,
			sir... a reversal of vowel and
			consonant, "bark" to "broc"...
			Yes, I know him... comes in here,
			stands at the bar, doesn't say
			much... always orders a warm milk.
			Figures.
			Warm milk helps you sleep, La
			Forge. You should try it. What's
			that got to do with Barclay?
			I don't know. I'm just trying
			to figure the man out, that's all.
			You ever talk to him?
			He's not much for talking.
			Does he have any friends?
			Not that I've seen.
			What do you do with a guy like
			that?
			I give him his warm milk and let
			him be.
			Yeah, well, I'm not so lucky.
			I can't let him be. He's my
			problem.
			He's imaginative.
			How do you know that?
			I just do.
			Well, then maybe he's in the wrong
			line of work.
			You engineering types don't
			appreciate imagination... ?
			That's not it, Guinan... he just
			doesn't fit in here...
			Terkim.
			What?
			Reminds me of Terkim. My
			mother's brother. A kind of
			family misfit. Everybody told
			me to stay away from him. Bad
			influence.
			Did you?
			Are you kidding? He was the only
			member of the family with a sense
			of humor. But no one ever stayed
			around him long enough to realize
			it... except me. My mother says
			I take after him. I probably do.
			Because the idea of "fitting in"
			repels me, too.
			Maybe I didn't make myself
			clear... Barclay, he's always
			late... he's nervous... nobody
			wants to be around him...
			If I had the feeling that nobody
			wanted to be around me, I'd
			probably be late and nervous too.
			Guinan, that's not the point...
			Are you sure?
			I'll take another one of these.
			Get it yourself.
			Computer, where is Lieutenant
			Barclay?
			Reg... ?
			Beverly?
			Good morning, Mi-lord.
			Manners, my son. Manners. You
			embarrass me before our guest.
			Master Barclay will spank you if
			you don't behave.
			I don't care.
			Wesley... ?
			What do you want?
			Ah, well, I guess I want... Master
			Barclay.
			The boys got into another little
			scrap, I'm afraid. But boys will
			be boys.
			You cannot withstand our assault
			forever, Barclay.
			Say you will yield and it ends
			here...
			I will speak with my sword, sir...
			Where in God's name did you learn
			to fight like this, man?
			Self-taught, my good capitaine.
			Shall I give you a few lessons?
			Who is that? One of your allies?
			Jean-Luc. Not that old trick.
			I'm disappointed in you.
			I'll... I'll make it easy for you,
			Commander. I'll just request
			reassignment...
			Now, wait a minute...
			Look, we both know... the whole
			ship knows... I can't cut it here.
			Hey, Barclay... I've spent a few
			hours in the Holodeck myself, you
			know.
			Far as I'm concerned... what you
			do in the Holodeck is your own
			business... as long as it doesn't
			affect your work.
			You're... you're not going to tell
			anyone about this?
			I'm not sure everyone would
			appreciate your... imagination...
			like I do.
			It is kind of unusual...
			recreating people you already
			know...
			I was just kind of really...
			well, it was just... I needed to
			blow off some steam... because
			one... one of the officers had
			been on my back...
			Let me guess...
			Okay, it was you. And I couldn't
			tell you what I wanted to, to your
			face... and it just sort of...
			I guess it got out of control.
			I don't know... sounds like maybe
			there's a side to this that's kind
			of therapeutic... we ought to tell
			Counselor Troi about it.
			It's... it's just more
			comfortable... when I'm in there.
			You don't know what a struggle
			it is for me, Commander.
			I'd like to help if I can.
			Being afraid all the time that
			I'll forget somebody's name. Or
			not knowing what to do with my
			hands...
			I mean, I'm the guy who writes
			down things to remember to say
			when there's a party. And when
			I get there, I'll wind up alone
			in a corner trying to look
			comfortable examining a potted
			plant.
			Sometimes, I just don't want to
			get out of bed in the morning.
			Sometimes, neither do I.
			No, but you're good. You were
			born to be in Starfleet. Me...
			You're just shy, Barclay.
			"Just shy"... sounds like
			nothing serious, doesn't it...
			You can't know.
			O'Brien to La Forge.
			Go ahead.
			I need you in Transporter Room
			Three, Commander.
			On my way, Chief.
			I really do want you to talk to
			Counselor Troi, Reg.
			Troi? No, no, I couldn't.
			I mean it. As your friend and
			as your commanding officer.
			I was synchronizing the phase
			transition coils... I didn't do
			anything I haven't done a hundred
			times before...
			The test object is made of pure
			duranium.
			Seems normal enough...
			Watch this...
			I'm glad I don't have anywhere
			to go.
			Chief engineer's log, Stardate
			43808.2. A systems analysis of
			Transporter Room Three has yielded
			no suggestion of a cause for the
			latest malfunction aboard the
			Enterprise.
			Is this part of the same pattern?
			We don't know, Captain. And we
			don't know why only Transporter
			Room Three is affected... None
			of the other Transporter Rooms
			are malfunctioning...
			Yet.
			We have twenty-two hours before
			we reach Nahmi Four. We'll need
			the transporters operational by
			then. I want a level one
			diagnostic across the board.
			(TECH)
			Advise Mister Barclay to meet us
			on the bridge immediately...
			Ah, could we push that back, just
			to fourteen hundred hours,
			Commander... I've got him doing
			something...
			Fourteen hundred hours.
			Mister O'Brien, no maintenance
			on the Transporters until further
			notice.
			Aye, sir.
			I can tell this is difficult for
			you.
			Is there anything I can do to make
			you more comfortable?
			No!
			Have you ever been with a
			counselor before?
			Yes. No.
			Which one?
			Yes. But she... it wasn't real...
			really a counselor.
			Most people find a counselor
			intimidating at first. It's okay
			if you feel that way toward me.
			Not... at all.
			Good. Close your eyes... Lean
			back.
			Why?
			I just want to help you relax.
			You do?
			Put your feet up... it's okay.
			And close your eyes...
			What are you going to do?
			Just listen to the sound of my
			voice...
			Take a slow deep breath through
			your nose... and let it out
			through your mouth just as
			slowly... good... there, that's
			better, isn't it...
			Oh, yes. Oh, yes, much better.
			This has been... extremely
			helpful...
			Well, thank-you for your time.
			But...
			Really... very helpful... in
			through the nose, out through the
			mouth... I'll practice and let
			you know... thank you again...
			I had a very strange visit from
			one of your officers today.
			Barclay. Yes, I can imagine. Were you
			able to do anything for him?
			To be honest, I'm not exactly sure
			what happened...
			Where is Mister Barclay... it's
			past fourteen hundred hours...
			Lieutenant Barclay to the bridge.
			Lieutenant Barclay report.
			Computer. Locate Lieutenant
			Barclay.
			Lieutenant Barclay is in Holodeck
			Two.
			I'll get him...
			No, I'll handle this. I've had
			it with him.
			Counselor, you better come
			along...
			I think you should know that
			Barclay's been running some...
			unique programs.
			I don't care what he's been
			running. My patience just ran
			out.
			Like I said Commander, Barclay's
			been running some... unusual
			programs.
			This is a violation of protocol.
			Crewmembers should not be
			simulated in the Holodeck...
			Ah, Commander... I don't think
			there's any regulation...
			Then there should be... computer,
			discontinue program and erase...
			Computer, belay that order!
			Counselor...
			If Barclay is having a difficult
			time facing reality, to suddenly
			destroy his only means of escape
			would be brutal and could do
			considerable damage.
			They are quite disagreeable,
			aren't they... shall we have a
			go at them?
			Delighted.
			We shall thrash them.
			En garde.
			Stop it. Put that down.
			Your sword, sir...
			I don't have a sword.
			How do expect to fight without
			your sword?
			I don't expect to fight.
			Do I detect a streak of yellow
			along the good fellow's back?
			Perhaps we can supply a more
			appropriate adversary for him.
			Number One...
			Number One...
			Am I late? Did I miss the fight?
			En garde...
			Sir... you have a familiar
			bearing... is it possible we have
			crossed swords somewhere before?
			Where is he? Where is Barclay?
			Ah, a personal grudge. I warn
			you... you would be wise to put
			your affairs in final order before
			you meet him in combat. You
			challenge the greatest sword in
			all the...
			... in all the Holodeck.
			You think this is funny?
			You are very tall. It could be
			very threatening to some people.
			Barclay'll find out what it means
			to be threatened. Computer,
			discontinue image of Riker.
			Sir, you have no sense of fair
			play.
			Just tell us where to find
			Barclay.
			You're gonna make us search
			through this to find him?
			It could provide us with valuable
			information about what's troubling
			him.
			There's nothing wrong with a
			healthy fantasy life, as long as
			it doesn't take over.
			You call this healthy?
			You're taking it so seriously.
			This is not without its element
			of humor...
			I am the Goddess of Empathy! Cast
			off your inhibitions and embrace
			love, truth, joy...
			Oh my God...
			Discard your facades and reveal
			your true being to me.
			Computer, discontinue --
			Belay that order, computer!
			We want to get more insight into
			what's troubling the poor man.
			Remember?
			Quite a healthy fantasy life,
			wouldn't you agree?
			Report...
			Sir, our velocity increased to
			warp seven point two five.
			Compensating, sir.
			Confirmed. Velocity now warp
			seven.
			Maintain that. What the hell
			happened?
			The matter/anti-matter injectors
			locked for a split second,
			Captain. I am not certain why.
			They seem to be working properly
			now.
			Picard to La Forge.
			Go ahead, Captain.
			Any explanation for the injector
			problem?
			I'm not in Engineering, sir. I'm
			in Holodeck Two.
			Another malfunction?
			Not exactly, sir. I'll return
			to Engineering immediately.
			Yes, I would say you should,
			Commander. Your Holodeck
			activities can wait until later.
			And Commander...
			Yessir?
			It would be wise to consult
			Lieutenant Barclay on this latest
			incident.
			I'd like to, very much, sir. La
			Forge out.
			We need to find Barclay. Now.
			Cast aside your masks and let me
			slip into your minds...
			Muzzle it.
			Shhhhh!
			We have a lot to talk about.
			Sir, Barclay and I better get
			to Engineering.
			Dismissed.
			I just couldn't keep my eyes
			open... I'd worked twelve hours
			on the power systems and then the
			transporter went down and...
			Reg... you had a chance to get
			some help from the real Counselor
			Troi... but instead you went back
			in there...
			I know... I didn't want to... I
			just couldn't help myself...
			You're gonna be able to write the
			book on holodiction.
			Look, I know how easy it is to
			get caught up in it. I... fell
			in love in there once.
			Really?
			But I knew when it was time to
			turn it off and say goodbye...
			Wasn't easy. But I did it.
			You know... the people I create
			in there have started to become
			more real to me... than anyone
			out here.
			Except maybe for you, Commander.
			I need you out here, Reg... right
			now, more than ever.
			The injectors aren't responding
			to the diagnostic commands.
			I... think we should drop out of
			warp.
			La Forge to bridge.
			Go ahead, Commander.
			Recommend we go to impulse power
			sir.
			Take us out of warp.
			Controls are not responding,
			Captain.
			It's the injectors.
			Override.
			It's not a computer problem. The
			mechanism is physically jammed.
			I can't clear it.
			Speed increasing, Captain. Warp
			seven point six... seven point
			six five... seven point seven...
			We can't shut it down, Captain.
			The anti-matter flow is
			increasing. She's accelerating
			out of control.
			Approaching warp nine sir...
			Red Alert.
			Data, estimated time to
			structural failure.
			At this rate of acceleration,
			fifteen minutes, forty seconds,
			Commander...
			Geordi, did you copy?
			Aye, Commander...
			Recommendations.
			I'll let you know as soon as we
			have some. La Forge out.
			Okay, this ship will start tearing
			itself apart in fifteen minutes...
			I want every idea on the table...
			I don't care how outrageous...
			What about attempting a magnetic
			quench on the fusion pre-burners?
			No, I tried that already... the
			magnetic fields won't reset.
			Could the fuel inlet servos be
			caught in cycle?
			If they were, the swirl dampers
			would be frozen too... and they
			aren't...
			Nothing showed up in the
			diagnostic sweep... at all?
			The tests... uh, showed problems...
			I mean no problems with the
			flow... the flow of the...
			There's nothing wrong with the
			computer control protocols or the
			power transfer systems. As far
			as we can determine, the injectors
			are just physically jammed...
			Injectors freeze... antigrav unit
			goes down... transporter
			malfunctions...
			And a twisted glass...
			What's the connection?
			Exceeding warp nine point four.
			Begin evacuation of secondary
			hull. Prepare for emergency
			saucer separation.
			Standing by to release docking
			clamps.
			Re-route systems to primary hull
			power sources.
			Captain, the plasma flow to the
			nacelles is uneven due to the
			injector lock. An emergency
			saucer separation could rupture
			the warp field.
			Twelve minutes to structural
			failure.
			None of the systems involved
			interact directly with each
			other... I don't see anything in
			common...
			What if... what if...
			what if one of us is the
			connection?
			Us? How?
			I don't know. But we're looking
			for... a, a systemic explanation
			and there isn't one. We work with
			all the systems that are affected
			... what if we're transmitting
			something ourselves... by touching
			it, or something...
			The computer sensors would've
			picked up anything dangerous.
			But... if it were something...
			something that we couldn't scan...
			You might've passed it to the
			injectors when you were realigning
			the magnetic capacitors.
			It was your glass, Duffy... and
			both of you were in the cargo bay
			when the anti-grav failed...
			So was O'Brien.
			The transporter malfunction.
			That's a connection too.
			Danger. Approaching safety
			limits of engine containment
			field.
			Computer, list all physical
			substances that wouldn't normally
			be picked up by internal scans.
			There are fifteen thousand five
			hundred twenty-five known
			substances that cannot be
			detected by standard scans.
			Great. How many of those can
			exist in an oxygen atmosphere?
			Five hundred thirty-two.
			And could alter molecular
			structure when it comes in
			contact with...
			... with glass.
			Five.
			On screen at this station.
			Jakmanite has a half life of about
			fifteen seconds. There wouldn't
			be enough time to spread it around
			the ship.
			Right.
			Selgninaem and Lucrovexitrin are
			extremely toxic.
			We'd all be dead by now. That
			leaves Saltzgadum and Invidium.
			Neither of which has been used
			for decades.
			Could either one be causing all
			these malfunctions?
			Most of the affected systems
			weren't even invented when those
			substances were in use. Who knows
			what they could do to a
			transporter or a magnetic
			capacitor... ?
			Wasn't Invidium used in...
			medical containment fields?
			Not for over a century.
			But the Mikulaks might still be
			using it.
			And one of those canisters was
			broken.
			La Forge to bridge. We have a
			working theory, Captain...
			There's a chance we picked up some
			Invidium from a broken canister
			in the cargo bay... and have been
			spreading it around the ship...
			Working theories are fine, Geordi.
			But we need a working solution
			in about five minutes...
			Understood, Commander. We're on
			our way to Cargo Bay Five for
			confirmation.
			Nothing from the tricorder...
			Danger. Exceeding safety limits
			of engine containment field. At
			current acceleration, structural
			failure will occur in three
			minutes, thirty seconds.
			There it is...
			Duffy and O'Brien picked up the
			broken canister and became
			contaminated..
			If we can get it... the
			invidium... down to minus two
			hundred degrees Celsius, it'll
			become inert.
			La Forge to bridge. Invidium is
			confirmed.
			Recommend we flood the injector
			pathway conduit with liquid
			nitrogen. That should neutralize
			it.
			The question is, will the
			injectors come back on-line?
			The injectors have sustained
			considerable damage, sir. I
			can't guarantee we'll be able to
			regain control...
			We don't have much choice, do we?
			Nossir.
			Make it so.
			Route primary coupling through
			starboard transfer conduit.
			Routing... ready for engine core
			injection.
			At current acceleration,
			structural failure will occur in
			forty-five seconds.
			Injector conduit temperature
			minus one hundred degrees
			Celsius.
			Transfer injector control to
			manual.
			Ready... temperature now minus
			one hundred ninety degrees...
			minus two hundred degrees, sir.
			Injector status?
			Matter injector... is on-line.
			Anti-matter injector... still
			locked.
			At current acceleration,
			structural failure will occur in
			thirty seconds.
			Cycle power through ventral
			relay.
			Anti-matter injector... on-line.
			Reducing flow capacity.
			Commencing warp engine shut-down.
			Stand down from Red Alert.
			Nice work, Geordi.
			Mister Barclay and I thank you,
			sir.
			Acknowledged.
			The ship is seriously
			contaminated with Invidium, sir.
			Recommend we set course for
			Starbase one-two-one for a
			complete systems and
			bio-decontamination.
			Understood.
			Glad you were with us out here
			in the real world today, Mister
			Barclay.
			It has been most difficult to
			reach this decision to leave
			you... but after thinking it
			over, discussing it at length with
			Counselor Troi... I think it is
			for the best... I just wanted to
			thank you all for your support...
			You'll always be welcome here,
			Barclay.
			I know. That's what makes it hard
			to go.
			It was a pleasure to serve with
			you, Mister Barclay.
			Good luck, Reg.
			It's been fun.
			Computer, end program.
			Erase all programs filed under
