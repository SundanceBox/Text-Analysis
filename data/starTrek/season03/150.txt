			Commander Riker to Ensign Crusher.
			Go ahead....
			Forget to set your alarm, Wesley?
			Uh, yessir. I'm... very sorry.
			I'll be right there.
			I didn't think you'd want to miss
			this.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43102.8.
			We have entered a spectacular
			double star system in the Kavis
			Alpha sector on a most critical
			mission of astro-physical
			research.
			Our eminent guest, Doctor Paul
			Stubbs, will attempt to study the
			decay of globules of neutronium
			expelled at relativistic speeds
			by a massive stellar explosion
			which will occur here in a matter
			of hours.
			It is virtually a
			once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
			as dictated by the forces of
			nature. But frankly, Doctor
			Stubbs seems much calmer about
			it all than those of us who are
			simply charged with the
			responsibility of delivery and
			observation.
			Ensign, our position....
			Approaching ten million kilometers
			from the neutron star...
			Slow to one third impulse power...
			Spectacular, isn't it, my young
			friend?
			Yessir.
			Over and over again, the intense
			gravitational pull of the little
			neutron star sucks up the star material
			from the red giant, and
			it builds up on the surface until
			it explodes... every one hundred
			and ninety six years. Like
			clockwork. And it is but eighteen
			hours away.
			Eighteen hours, seven minutes,
			and ... ten seconds, Doctor.
			The interstellar counterpart to
			Earth's "Old Faithful". The only
			predictable burst of energy in
			the universe that can accomplish
			our goal.
			Doctor Stubbs, if you want to make
			a final inspection of the unit...
			Captain, I've been inspecting the
			egg for twenty years... you may
			lay it when ready.
			Begin launch sequence.
			Shuttle Bay Two, stand-by to
			launch the uh, "egg"...
			Standing by, Commander...
			Do you know how long the
			experiment will last, Wesley... ?
			One billionth of a second.
			Now, how would you know that?
			When I heard we were going to be
			part of your experiment, I read
			all your published works.
			Begin pre-launch sequence.
			Five minutes to launch site.
			Stabilize.
			The ship is not responding.
			Checking for failure of inertia
			dampeners... Instruments say
			they're working...
			Captain, we're heading straight
			into the path of that stellar
			matter....
			Shields up.
			Negative. The shields won't
			respond.
			Impact thirty seconds.
			Go to manual override to raise
			shields.
			Shields are rising.
			Reset dampeners.
			Dampeners not responding. Unable
			to reset.
			Reverse impulse engines.
			Initiating reverse sequence.
			Impact twenty seconds.
			The momentum is still taking us
			into the path of the
			stellar matter.
			Close the shuttle bay door...
			Prepare for impact.
			Door is frozen, Commander...
			Commander Data, check all
			systems... Medical personnel to
			the bridge.
			All systems functioning normally
			again.
			Computer, explanation for control
			malfunction.
			No control malfunction has been
			recorded.
			Hey, Wesley, you need some work
			on your right turns...
			They're running a check to find
			out what happened. Everything's
			okay now...
			We're going into the Holodeck to
			ski in Switzerland, Wes... want
			to come?
			Oh... I can't... I have to check
			on Doctor Stubbs. He's in
			Sickbay...
			Wesley, I have this awkward
			situation... Two gorgeous ladies,
			only one of me and a terrific
			program where we get snowed in
			at the ski lodge... just the fire
			and each other to keep us warm...
			I can hold the storm for you...
			meet us at the lodge later on.
			I can't, Eric. There's just too
			much to do...
			Yeah, okay... next time.
			The captain asked me to tell you
			that our systems are back to
			normal and we can make another
			launch attempt as soon as you're
			ready.
			Quite a dynamic family team, you
			Crushers....
			It's nice to be back together.
			I was at Starfleet Medical for
			a year... I missed about two
			inches of him.
			I'm not sure I'd want my mother
			to be flying through space with
			me... no, I take that back. I
			am sure. I wouldn't want her.
			I love her dearly you understand.
			Does that hurt?
			My mother's a formidable woman
			too. A woman of letters.
			A great critic.
			I know.
			Good Lord, son. You didn't read
			that unauthorized biography too...
			I totally deny the story about
			the consulate's wife on Beldoron.
			We were only good friends. Is
			that all the boy does, Doctor,
			fly the ship and read? Doesn't
			he have any fun?
			Sure he does...
			My studies keep me pretty busy.
			I'm trying to get into the
			Academy... I earn credits for
			my work on the Enterprise... but
			it's not the same as being
			there...
			Ready to sit up?
			I am whole again, thank you,
			Doctor.
			Come along, Wesley, let's make
			sure Humpty Dumpty is still in
			one piece.
			Computer, fix the food slot...
			The food slot is functioning
			properly.
			Well, check it again...
			The food slot is functioning
			properly.
			Deactivate food slot.
			We're analyzing the engineering
			systems data, Captain... so far
			nothing unusual in the computer
			log for that time period...
			Run a level one diagnostic series.
			We need a computer that's one
			hundred percent to run Doctor
			Stubbs' experiment.
			... As well as the food slots in
			Sickbay.
			It seems to be working again.
			For the moment anyway...
			What can I do for you, Doctor?
			Jean-Luc, how would you feel if
			you were a seventeen year old and
			the only starship officer whose
			mother was on board... ?
			If you're concerned about Wesley,
			I see no evidence that there's
			a problem.
			I know. In a funny kind of way...
			that's exactly my point. We talk.
			We smile. It's almost too
			polite.
			Beverly, this is simply a matter
			of time. I know how difficult
			it was to be away.
			Tell me about him.
			He's... become a fine officer.
			He works as hard as any member
			of the crew... Riker says his
			studies...
			No, tell me about him.
			He seems well adjusted...
			Does he have many friends... has
			he been in love... ?
			Jean-Luc, he's come so far, so
			fast. And since I've been back
			I don't feel...
			His dependence?
			He is seventeen, Beverly.
			What were you doing when you were
			seventeen?
			Getting into a lot more trouble
			than Wesley is, I can assure you.
			So was I.
			Isn't that what seventeen is
			supposed to be?
			No cracks in the armor... we'll
			be just fine...
			How can you be so calm about
			everything? If I was about to
			make this kind of breakthrough...
			I've never doubted for a moment
			that this day would come, Wesley.
			And I suspect some day it will
			come for you as well. I see a
			lot of me in you.
			In my youth, they called me a
			vunderkind... do you understand
			vunderkind... ?
			It's German, isn't it?
			It means wonder child. It is
			reserved for those of us who
			achieve early in life. Now the
			burden is yours.
			The burden?
			To fulfill your potential.
			You will never come up against
			a greater adversary than your own
			potential, my young friend.
			Red Alert. You should return
			to your quarters immediately.
			Still no visual contact?
			Impossible... Mister Worf, same
			magnification. Fifty degrees
			starboard.
			Worf, you're absolutely sure...
			The sensors clearly indicate the
			approach of a Borg vessel.
			Shields up.
			Shields are not responding.
			Manual overide is jammed. It's
			not gonna work this time... we
			don't have shields, Captain.
			Captain, they've fired energy
			weapons at us...
			Evasive action.
			Bring about to two-eight-five mark three.
			Predict current vector of the Borg
			ship.
			Vector... is gone.
			And so is the Borg vessel.
			You're telling me this was another
			computer glitch?
			It is conceivable that we were
			viewing a synthetically
			generated image... although there
			is no precedent for it.
			Our computer was daydreaming... ?
			Computer, identify malfunction
			immediately.
			Pawn to King Three... Knight to
			Rook Four... Queen to Bishop
			Three...
			Controls are not responding.
			Impulse engines are down.
			Try warp engines.
			Sorry, Commander... I better get
			back to engineering...
			Lieutenant Worf, you will
			accompany Commander La Forge.
			I want a full report on the
			prospects for getting our shields
			back. Commanders Data and Riker
			will join me in the conference
			room to consider the future of
			this mission... if there is one.
			The fact of the matter is we're
			dealing with a potential breakdown
			of our main computer...
			That's hard to accept.
			The system automatically provides
			for self-correction, Captain.
			There has not been a system-wide
			technological failure on a
			starship in seventy-nine years.
			Excuse me, Captain, Doctor Stubbs
			has been waiting to see you. I
			think it might be wise if...
			Captain, I'm sure you have
			everything under control, I'd just
			like to know what's going on.
			Of course, Doctor. Sit down.
			Counselor...
			Commander La Forge is attempting
			repairs as we speak...
			"Attempting" ... that doesn't sound
			particularly reassuring.
			Doctor, if it is at all possible,
			we will continue this mission as
			planned.
			Captain, if we miss our chance
			now we don't get another for two
			centuries. There will be many
			questions asked by Starfleet if
			the Enterprise fails in its
			duty...
			Nevertheless, my first and
			foremost concern will be to insure
			the safety of this ship and its
			crew...
			Insure the safety, Captain or are
			you really talking about playing
			it safe?
			My dear Doctor, in our current
			position, when that star explodes,
			you'll get to watch your
			experiment from the inside out.
			I would rather die than leave.
			I don't believe you speak for the
			majority, Doctor.
			Doctor Stubbs, I know how much
			this means to you...
			My dear Counselor, no insult
			intended but please turn off your
			beam into my soul. I will share
			the feelings I wish to share...
			Lieutenant Worf to Captain Picard.
			Captain, all weapons systems are
			down.
			Estimated time for repairs?
			Commander, I don't even know what
			to repair yet.
			Continue to advise.
			Well, if we do not take our leave
			in time, so be it... it's one sure
			way into the history books, eh?
			His nonchalance is studied and
			practiced...
			Even my sensory perception picked
			that up today...
			In fact, he's put his entire self-worth
			on the line with this
			experiment. He is telling the
			truth when he says he'd rather
			die than leave.
			And one more thing... he doesn't
			like women very much.
			Odd. The research material on
			Doctor Stubbs includes not a few
			references from gossip columns.
			It suggests females find him quite
			attractive.
			Not this one.
			What happened to you?
			We had a little accident on the
			Holodeck....
			On the Holodeck... but it's
			programmed to prevent injuries...
			I was making a great run down a
			deserted slope when the ground
			just seemed to fall away....
			Engineering, this is Doctor
			Crusher. The Holodecks are to
			be closed by my order until
			further notice.
			We've been having control problems
			today. There's a small fracture
			here... this'll just take a
			minute...
			You look like you could use
			something warm inside you... hot
			chocolate, maybe?
			Wes almost came along. It's
			probably a good thing he didn't.
			I didn't know he was going skiing
			with you...
			It was one of those last minute
			things... we tried to grab him
			on the way...
			We don't see much of him now that
			he's been assigned to the bridge.
			Omigod....
			What happened...
			He's not breathing...
			If he had been alone, he would
			have died.
			Advise everyone to remain in their
			quarters when not on duty.
			Protocol "B" access to all power
			components. Nobody else uses them
			unless it's cleared by Commander
			Riker.
			Sir, is it possible this is not
			a computer breakdown?
			What if it is some form of attack?
			Our sensors showed no sign of life
			in this stellar system.
			They also showed a Borg vessel
			that did not exist. Counselor
			Troi?
			I perceive no life force,
			Captain... no feelings of ill
			will. But I am not attuned to
			every form of life.
			Data, stay on the sensors... see
			if we can't pick up something
			out there.
			It does almost seem as if
			something... or someone is trying
			to render the Enterprise helpless.
			They're not just trying, Number
			One. If it's true, they're doing
			a damn good job of it.
			You got it. Nice going, Geordi...
			Call up the cross-section of
			computer core processor
			four-five-one, elements
			zero-two-hundred through
			zero-three-hundred.
			In order to get some power, I had
			to by-pass the computer core and
			essentially hotwire the
			connection.
			Look at that lesion. No wonder
			we're coming apart at the seams.
			It's some kind of continuing
			disintegration. But from what... I
			can't tell ya. And I haven't the
			slightest idea how to stop it.
			But it's just a mechanical
			problem, right?
			Increase magnification, factor
			fifty.
			I don't know, Wesley. Looking
			at it... if it weren't...
			impossible... I'd say someone had
			climbed in there and started
			taking it apart.
			Guinan... I didn't think anyone
			would be here.
			I've never been very good at being
			confined to quarters. Any of my
			husbands would testify to that.
			What are these things?
			I'm just setting... traps.
			I run a clean place here.
			I know. It's not that. I just...
			Guinan, I'm scared. Everything
			that's been going wrong may be
			my fault.
			Pull up a stool, Wesley.
			I've been working on my final
			project for Advanced Genetics.
			It's on nanotechnology. And I've
			been studying the nanites we have
			in the Sickbay genetic supplies.
			They're just like tiny little
			robots with gigabytes of
			mechanical computer memory, tiny
			enough to enter living cells and
			conduct repairs. They're supposed
			to be strictly confined to the
			lab.
			Are you trying to say some nanites
			are on the loose?
			Two of them. That's all. See,
			I just wanted to see how they
			would interact and function in
			tandem. In my project, I had
			proposed a theory that they could
			actually combine their skills to
			improve their usefulness. And
			it was working.
			You made a better nanite.
			I was pulling an all-nighter to
			get my final data... and I fell
			asleep. When I woke up, I
			realized the container was still
			open...
			It was just a science project.
			A doctor once said the very same
			thing to me... what was his
			name... Frankenstein, I think.
			They're really harmless. They
			only have the most basic skills.
			It's almost impossible that they
			could be responsible...
			Almost.
			Doctor Crusher to Wesley Crusher.
			Go ahead.
			I stopped by your quarters, Wes.
			I assumed you'd be there, since
			you're off duty.
			I was just... I had some things
			to do...
			Orders are orders, Mister Crusher.
			You won't tell anybody...
			I know. I will. If it's true.
			Wesley...
			Think you'll get a good grade?
			I always get an A.
			So did Doctor Frankenstein.
			Captain's log, supplemental. Our
			computer core has clearly been
			tampered with and yet there is
			no sign of a breach of security
			on board.
			We have even considered sabotage,
			but Counselor Troi has not
			detected any such sentiments.
			We have engines back and will
			attempt to complete our mission...
			but without a reliable computer,
			Doctor Stubbs' experiment is in
			serious jeopardy.
			Manual restart sequence?
			Manual restart successful...
			impulse engine functions appear
			normal.
			Proceed.
			Shuttle Bay Two, open hangar
			doors.
			Doors did not respond. Repeating
			sequence.
			What in heaven's name... ?
			It is "Stars and Stripes Forever"
			by John Phillip Sousa, a popular
			American composer of band music
			in the early twentieth century...
			Yes... yes... I know...
			Computer, shut off the music....
			The music is on all communications
			channels, Captain.
			Power... weapons...
			communications. We're being
			stripped one system at a time...
			Shut off the power to the bridge.
			I feel no hostile emotions
			present. No friendly feelings
			either. Nothing.
			Only an enemy without honor
			refuses to show himself in battle.
			We may be fighting a different
			kind of enemy than we've ever
			known... an enemy that fights a
			war of nerves.
			Resume power to the bridge.
			Commander La Forge, can you get
			us out of this star system
			safely...
			No...
			Not now, Doctor.
			I'll try, Captain. I don't want
			to overload the engines...
			Do it gently. But do it.
			We'll circuit in auxiliary power
			to the bridge... and find some
			way to silence Sousa if he tries
			an encore.
			The priority is to find out who
			or what is doing this and why.
			Those of us not involved in that
			detail should get a few minutes
			rest. Commander Data, the bridge,
			or what's left of it, is yours.
			The egg that Stubbs laid.
			Nobody will say that...
			Nobody will say... anything,
			Wesley. We will not even be
			mentioned.
			I could live with failure.
			... Well, maybe not. But never
			even to try. To miss your one
			chance at bat. Do you know
			baseball?
			My dad taught it to me when I was
			little.
			Once, centuries ago, it was the
			beloved national pastime of the
			Americas, Wesley. Abandoned by
			a society that prized fast food
			and faster games. Lost to
			impatience. But I have seen the
			great players make the great
			plays.
			Do you recreate them on a
			Holodeck?
			No, in here...
			With the knowledge of
			statistics... runs, hits and
			errors... times at bat... box
			scores. Men like us do not need
			Holodecks, Wesley. I have played
			seasons in my mind. It was my
			reward to myself. For patience.
			Knowing my turn would come. Call
			your shot. Point to a star. One
			great blast and the crowd rises.
			A brand new era in astro-physics.
			Postponed one hundred and
			ninety-six years on account of
			rain.
			We have to talk.
			You really look like you could
			use some rest...
			I know. It's okay. Really.
			No, it's not. Really.
			I'm just checking some traps that
			I set... to see if I can find out
			what's happening to the ship.
			On someone's orders... ?
			We're running out of time for
			Doctor Stubbs...
			Wesley, you can't put everything
			on your own shoulders. Even when
			you're off duty, you're on duty...
			Mom, you don't understand...
			You're a seventeen year old boy...
			I'm an acting officer... I have
			responsibilities....
			I'm beginning to think... maybe
			we're all expecting too much of
			you.
			I've done everything anyone has
			asked of me and more. You don't
			know... you haven't even been
			here.
			I'm here now, Wesley.
			C'mon, I'll help you finish this
			up... what are you looking for?
			Wesley... ?
			Mom, I think I've made a horrible
			mistake.
			Nanites. Tiny machines built from
			the atom up.
			Designed to have exposure only
			to the inside of nucleii during
			celluar surgeries. Until then,
			they are kept tightly confined
			in a non-functional state.
			These are not ordinary nanites.
			No, these have... evolved.
			Evolved... how does a machine
			evolve...
			It's true. I'm reponsible. I
			allowed two of the nanites to
			interact for my school project
			to increase their capabilities.
			And... they escaped.
			School... project...
			Just how far have these things...
			evolved?
			This is a sample of linear memory
			crystal from our computer core.
			It's like candy to them...
			They're now capable of
			mechanically replicating
			themselves. And who knows what
			else....
			It is conceivable that with each
			new generation they enhance their
			own design. The rate of evolution
			would be...extraordinary.
			How many generations are we
			dealing with here?
			Engineering, display computer
			core processor four-five-one,
			element zero-two-nine-nine.
			Increase magnification, factor
			one thousand.
			A few.
			Can it be possible that they know
			what they're doing...
			Why would they attack us?
			Why does a mosquito bite your ear
			and who cares? The answer is
			simple. Call an exterminator.
			Doctor Stubbs, these nanites are
			apparently operating with a new
			collective intelligence... working
			together, teaching each other
			skills...
			Doctor, are you suggesting they
			are becoming a... civilization?
			Oh really. I'm sorry but this
			is nonsense. You can't have a
			civilization of computer chips.
			They're made in a plant in Dakar
			Senegal. I've watched the
			construction.
			Then how do you explain what
			you've seen here?
			It's no more mysterious than
			watching a strain of the Leutscher
			virus reproduce itself. And that
			at least is a bona fide lifeform.
			How many disease germs and viruses
			have you destroyed in your time,
			Doctor Crusher?
			I cannot exterminate... something
			that "may or may not" be
			intelligent.
			My good Captain...
			There is still time.
			Ensign Crusher, work with Data
			to find some way to remove them
			safely. If things get worse,
			we'll take stronger measures.
			Gentlemen. I need a computer
			functioning perfectly in less
			than eight hours... and we still
			have core reconstruction to
			consider...
			We're testing a low level gamma
			field that might reduce their
			processing speed.
			Have you considered a high level
			charge?
			High level gamma radiation would
			kill them, Doctor Stubbs.
			I know.
			Doctor Stubbs...
			I can't get the story of David
			and Goliath out of my head. How
			long do we wait, Number One?
			We can continue to bypass parts
			of the computer that are
			affected... but if these nanites
			are spreading all over the ship...
			Do you smell a change in...
			Picard to La Forge...
			enviromental system malfunction
			on the bridge... acknowledge...
			Nitrogen oxide... toxic levels...
			I've switched to manual control
			of the air handling system...
			He entered a computer access
			room and sterilized one of the
			processors with gamma radiation.
			The nanites in the upper core
			are all dead, Captain.
			You have no choice now... it is
			a matter of survival.
			If you were a member of my crew,
			sir, I would...
			But I am not a member of your
			crew, sir... I am a representative
			of the highest command of the
			Federation... which has directed
			you to perform my experiment...
			If one man, woman or child on my
			ship dies because of your
			experiment... I will have your head
			before the highest command of the
			Federation...
			Good Lord, you are talking about
			machines with a screw loose.
			Simply turn them off. And be done
			with them.
			Doctor Stubbs, your own actions
			have provided evidence to the
			contrary. After you destroyed
			the nanites in the core, they
			immediately responded by
			interfering with our life-support
			systems.
			It is hard to accept these as
			random actions by machines with
			"loose screws". In effect, you
			may have proven that the nanites
			do have a collective intelligence.
			Captain, I'm feeling a vague
			presence. It wasn't there before.
			It is not hostility... More like
			a primitive sense of
			self-preservation.
			If they have evolved this
			far... into emotional growth... how
			can we destroy them now?
			The ship is at risk.
			Extermination may be the only
			alternative left.
			A good point...
			Lieutenant Worf, Doctor Stubbs
			is to be restricted to his
			quarters until further notice.
			Data, can you find me a way to
			communicate with these things?
			With intelligence, they have the
			capacity for language.
			But it will depend on how far
			their evolution has brought them.
			We could modify the circuits in
			the universal translator to make
			it capable of communications with
			them...
			Proceed.
			May I come in?
			You just can't resist, can you,
			Counselor?
			I only want to help.
			Yes, yes... to break the shell...
			to get in touch with my true
			feelings. What is this
			preoccupation women have with
			de-mystifying me? It must be the
			challenge. Climb me. Because
			I'm there.
			I am only worried about your state
			of mind, Doctor.
			All right, Counselor... what is
			it that has you so worried?
			Your single-mindedness, your need
			to have this experiment work...
			But it will. Picard has no choice
			now. He must defend the
			Enterprise.
			Counselor, when this is over, I
			will show you New Manhattan on
			Beth Delta-One as you've never
			seen it and we will laugh over
			glasses of champagne.
			Your self portrait is so
			practiced, so polished....
			Yes, isn't it, though?
			It is stretched so tight that the
			tension fills this room. And if
			you finally... fail... I fear it
			will snap.
			A good try, Counselor. But
			sometimes when you reach beneath
			a man's self portrait, as you so
			eloquently put it, deep down,
			inside... what you find... is
			nothing at all.
			Lockman on first, Dark on
			second... Thompson at the plate...
			Branca on the mound...
			He's coming around...
			I have to believe this was not
			an arbitrary attack...
			Has Data made any progress in
			contacting them?
			You must protect me. Kill them.
			Commander Riker, on my signal,
			we will gamma-irradiate all
			computer systems throughout the
			Enterprise to end this conflict.
			Worf, prepare to activate gamma
			pulse generators.
			Electromagnetic scanners ready,
			Captain.
			Captain...
			I have established contact.
			Are you okay?
			I will be. As soon as we finish
			off these pests.
			Wesley, do not be too harsh in
			your judgment of me... until
			you've walked a lifetime in my
			shoes.
			We are no different, you and I.
			For you right now, it's getting
			into the Academy. For me, it's
			the egg. Others will never
			understand how important our work
			is to us. It's everything we live
			for.
			Doctor Stubbs, I want to go the
			Academy. But if I don't, I have
			other things to live for.
			Of course you do.
			They are virtually learning the
			concept of communication as we
			continue, Captain... each new
			generation is making
			modifications.
			Can we actually talk to them yet?
			I think it is worth an attempt...
			Ask them for a cease-fire... put
			it in whatever words you think
			they'll understand.
			Captain, their answer is... no.
			Tell them it is critical to their
			survival as well as our own.
			Their answer is no.
			I sense that after the incident
			in the computer core, there is
			very little trust...
			Bring Doctor Stubbs to the bridge.
			The universal translator has its
			limits. I prefer to negotiate
			eye to eye with my enemy...
			I don't think there's much chance
			of that here.
			But they have already tried to
			kill me once...
			"One sure way into the history
			books", Doctor...
			Tell them the human who destroyed
			their comrades is here and wishes
			to address them...
			Captain, if I might...
			And you, sir will explain your
			error and apologize and pray that
			we can negotiate a peace we can
			all live with... is that clear?
			Captain, if a face to face
			negotiation would be helpful,
			I would like to volunteer myself
			as a conduit.
			Yourself, Data?
			I can easily furnish the nanites
			with a schematic design of my
			neurological structure. Entering
			my neural network would require
			only their most basic skills.
			That's what they were designed
			for.
			They could easily penetrate the
			molecular fabric of my
			hand-covering into the nerve
			circuitry and interface with my
			verbal programs.
			If they have control of a
			Starfleet commander, they become
			an even greater threat.
			How do we know we'll ever get them
			out of you, Data...
			There are considerable risks.
			But it would also represent a
			gesture of trust on our part.
			It could be an important step
			toward peace.
			All right. Propose it to the
			nanites.
			The answer is yes.
			They are ready, Captain.
			Proceed.
			You are very strange looking
			creatures.
			In our travels, we have
			encountered many other
			creatures... even stranger-looking
			than we are... and all of us try
			to co-exist peacefully.
			The urge among us to destroy all
			of your kind is intense. Why did
			you attack us?
			We misinterpreted your actions
			as an attack against us.
			We were only seeking raw materials
			for our replication process.
			Yes, but you endangered the vessel
			in which we all travel.
			You almost killed a crewmember.
			We meant no harm. We were only
			exploring.
			We understand. We are also
			explorers and we mean no harm to
			any life-form.
			I am the one responsible for the
			deaths in the computer core.
			We know who you are.
			I... deeply regret the incident.
			I am a scientist on an important
			mission. Your... your colleagues'
			exploration of the core memory
			put our mission at risk. I only
			meant to protect a lifetime of
			work from being destroyed.
			I am at your mercy.
			What is "mercy"?
			He asks you to forgive him. This
			conflict was started by
			mistakes... on both sides. Let
			us end it here and now.
			We agree.
			I pledge to you that we will
			provide any assistance you need
			for your continued survival.
			Thank you, but we have evolved
			beyond any need for your
			assistance. This vessel has
			become too confining. We require
			relocation.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43104.7.
			Doctor Stubbs has generously used
			his influence to arrange the
			designation of planet Kavis-Alpha-Four
			as the new home of the Nanite
			Civilization. Plans to negotiate
			a treaty are underway.
			Commander Data's neural network
			has been vacated... He has been
			returned to us, unharmed, and with
			the help of the nanites, our
			computer core has been
			reconstructed in time for the
			experiment...
			Ten seconds to stellar blast.
			We're at forty million kilometers
			from the neutron star.
			Hold your position.
			Doctor?
			Do you have any children, Guinan?
			A lot.
			Ever have any trouble relating
			to them?
			Just one.
			One?
			He wouldn't listen.
			Well, they all go through that.
			Not in a species of listeners.
			Did he grow out of it?
			Well, it's taken a few hundred
			years or so but I've brought him
			around.
			How?
			A mother shapes her child in ways
			she doesn't even realize.
			Sometimes just by listening.
			Cute couple.
			Now, see, that's healthy for a
			boy his age. I mean that as a
			doctor not just a mother. It's
			good to see him having fun... with
			an attractive young woman... who
			obviously looks at him with
			extraordinary affection...
			What do you know about this girl?
