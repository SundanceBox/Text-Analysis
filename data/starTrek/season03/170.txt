			Captain's log, Stardate 43872.2.
			In order to neutralize a sudden
			contamination of the water supply
			at the Federation colony on Beta
			Agni Two, we are procuring one
			hundred and eight kilos of
			hytritium from the Zibalian
			trader, Kivas Fajo.
			Because pure hytritium is too
			unstable for our transporters,
			Lieutenant Commander Data has been
			shuttling the material to the
			Enterprise.
			Data to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Mister Data.
			This will be the last trip... the
			remaining cases of hytritium are
			now being loaded.
			Acknowledged. Mister Worf,
			advise Beta Agni Two that our
			departure is imminent.
			Aye, Captain.
			At warp six, we should be there
			in just over sixteen hours.
			Loading is complete. I am
			proceeding with departure.
			Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
			for docking, level one
			precautions for incoming material
			remain in effect.
			If you'll just acknowledge this
			last load, Commander...
			Twenty-four point six kilos of
			tripolymer composites... eleven
			point eight kilos of molybdenumcobalt
			alloys... one point three
			kilos Bioplast sheeting...
			Shuttle twelve containment field
			reads nominal... Now leaving the
			Jovis.
			On viewer.
			Containment field stable...
			gravitational fluctuations within
			acceptable parameters... flight
			pattern...
			Why didn't the containment field
			hold?
			Unknown, Commander.
			Hail the Jovis -- I want to speak
			with Kivas Fajo.
			Sir, Mister Fajo is hailing us.
			On screen.
			Captain Picard -- what happened?
			It is unclear at this time; we're
			running a full analysis.
			We detected no malfunctions before
			the explosion. Everything seemed
			to be proceeding as smoothly as
			the other flights. Were you able
			to save the pilot?
			No.
			I'm sorry.
			Mister Fajo, I would like to
			analyze your sensor readings of
			the explosion.
			Compared to the Enterprise's, our
			sensors are rather primitive --
			I doubt they contain any
			information yours have overlooked.
			Perhaps, but I want to leave no
			avenue unexplored.
			I understand. We'll transmit the
			information.
			Link established... Receiving.
			Can we be of any further
			assistance?
			How much hytritium did we manage
			to bring on board?
			Eighty-one kilos.
			That might be barely enough to
			complete our mission, Captain...
			but it's not leaving us any margin
			for error.
			I realize we have acquired your
			complete supply of hytritium.
			Do you know where we could obtain
			more?
			That may be difficult. The only
			source I know is in the Sigma
			Erani System.
			Three weeks away.
			And I can't guarantee they'll have
			any -- for obvious reasons, no
			one wants to keep it around. In
			fact, even I may stop selling
			it -- it's just too dangerous.
			I guess we're fortunate you had
			any at all, sir.
			Transfer of information is
			complete, Captain.
			Mister Fajo, thank you for your
			help.
			Mister Crusher, lay in a course
			for Beta Agni Two, warp six.
			Aye, sir.
			The Grissom is currently near
			the Sigma Erani system... I'll
			have them stand by in case we need
			more hytritium.
			Very good, Number One.
			Course laid in, sir.
			Engage.
			Gibberish...
			...Starfleet... gibberish...
			Enterprise.
			Wondrous. The detail... the
			balance. A remarkable piece of
			work.
			Why have I been brought here?
			The voice simulation is perfect.
			Inflections, timing...
			It took a lot of effort to get
			you here... but I was sure it
			would be worth it. I was right.
			I have been delivered here against
			my wishes. I would like to know
			the reason.
			Certainly. You're here for my
			enjoyment and appreciation.
			Am I to infer that you intend to
			keep me captive?
			Captive? A most inappropriate
			description, my good android.
			May I call you Data?
			It is my name.
			I know.
			Data, you will be catered to,
			fawned over... you will be cared
			for as never before... every wish
			will be fulfilled...
			I wish to leave.
			Almost every wish.
			This is unacceptable. I have no
			desire to remain here... and even
			if I did, my Starfleet duties
			would not permit it.
			Single-minded, isn't it?
			Very persistent...
			But polite. A nice touch.
			I decline to allow you to leave.
			Then I am forced to attempt
			escape.
			Ten androids like you might be
			able to force it open.
			But there aren't any other
			androids like you, are there?
			It's keyed to the touch... reads
			galvanic skin response, DNA
			patterns, and two or three other
			things. Trust me... you can't
			open it.
			Then you will have to open it for
			me.
			I wouldn't try that again.
			It's a proximity-actuated field
			that impedes positron flow. Not
			good for your brainpaths in the
			long term.
			I fail to understand the value
			you place upon my presence.
			Do you? Look around. This room
			contains items gathered from half
			the galaxy.
			The very first Basotile ever
			created by the Rodulans...
			centuries old. Priceless. A vase
			carved by the late Mark Off-Zel
			on Sirrie Four. The only known
			Roger Maris trading card from
			Earth circa 1962... smell it...
			Bubblegum... I've preserved the
			scent...
			A Lapling...
			But I thought they were extinct...
			Yes, that is the general belief.
			She's the last surviving member
			of her species... defenseless
			little creature, pity.
			Everything you see -- the only
			one of its kind. Unique. An
			original. Just as you are.
			Here, this is for you... your
			place of honor... sit... if it
			is not comfortable... but of
			course, you have no thought of
			comfort, do you...
			When Palor Toff learns of this,
			he will swallow his tongue with
			envy... I cannot wait to see his
			face...
			You are the crown jewel of my
			collection. A treasure beyond
			comparison.
			You should be flattered.
			I am not. Most intelligent
			lifeforms find involuntary
			confinement offensive and
			inequitable. Moreover, you have
			violated Federation law --
			Yes, I know. What I've done is
			evil, selfish, immoral, illegal,
			and unprincipled.
			I've learned to live with it.
			The Andorians wish to bid for the
			shipment of Tellurian spices you
			offered.
			They've had four days... they
			would have to make up their minds
			now. Ah, well...
			I must emphasize, Mister Fajo,
			that I consider this captivity
			a hostile act on your part.
			You'll get used to it.
			I can't believe he's gone.
			I always thought he'd outlive us
			-- by centuries.
			He'd been working on this for
			months... never felt it was quite
			finished...
			You know what a critic Data was...
			especially about his own work.
			It was a gift from the captain.
			Then he should have it back.
			Those should go to Commander
			Riker.
			Data always fell for Riker's
			bluffs...
			These are some of Starfleet's
			highest honors.
			Not bad for a walking pile of
			circuitry and memory cells.
			I keep going over and over the
			accident in my mind. Trying to
			figure out what went wrong. I
			can see him in the shuttle...
			almost like I'm sitting next to
			him... going through the
			departure sequence... What the
			hell happened? Why didn't I see
			it coming? Did I miss something...
			Kivas wishes you to wear this set
			of clothes. And sit in your
			chair.
			I have no reason to accede to
			Mister Fajo's wishes.
			He will give you reasons if you
			force him to.
			He is deluding himself if he
			believes he can keep me here.
			The Enterprise is certain to find
			me --
			They're not even looking for
			you... they believe you're
			destroyed. Your shuttle blew
			up... a hytritium explosion.
			They will scan the debris and
			discover I was not aboard...
			They'll find exactly what they
			expect to find: traces of your
			component elements. We placed
			them aboard the shuttle in just
			the right proportions.
			Plainly Mister Fajo has no moral
			difficulties with my imprisonment
			here.
			"Mister Fajo" has no moral
			difficulties. At all.
			Do you?
			Clever, android... Is it part
			of your program to seek out
			vulnerabilities in your enemies?
			Yes.
			Are you my enemy?
			I obey Fajo. And so does everyone
			on this ship.
			Why?
			You are a curious... thing...
			aren't you... ?
			Do you object to the question?
			Kivas finds a way to get what he
			wants from his people. His
			rewards for loyalty are lavish.
			His punishments for disloyalty
			are equally lavish. You won't
			find anyone here who'll help you
			escape.
			Face it, android. He has you.
			It appears he has us both.
			Computer, did the containment
			power supply or the backups fail
			prior to the explosion?
			Telemetry indicates no
			interruption in containment field
			power supply. Backup safety field
			and reserve power was available
			up until the instant of
			explosion.
			Analyze telemetry from gravity
			generator, impulse vents, fuel
			cells, inertial dampers, and
			related subsystems.
			All readings negative.
			What about external factors?
			Local stellar phenomena?
			Negative. Interstellar radiation
			and EM spikes all within normal
			tolerances.
			Was the shuttle close enough to
			the Enterprise to have been
			affected by our warp fields?
			Negative. Warp systems were
			operating at twelve percent idle,
			insufficient to disrupt
			containment fields.
			Return file to start... Let's
			go through it all again...
			The reason I can't find anything
			is there's nothing there to find.
			I've run the analysis a dozen
			times over... there's no
			indication of a malfunction...
			No possible explanation at all... ?
			Well, yeah, there's one, but I
			don't believe it. Pilot error.
			I know it's hard to accept, but
			even the best...
			Captain, it's not hard to
			accept... with Data, it's almost
			impossible. I can't even begin
			to calculate the odds. If Data
			were here, we could ask him...
			What are you suggesting,
			Commander?
			I don't really know, sir. It just
			doesn't make sense. I like things
			to make sense... that's all.
			Geordi, if you got a little rest,
			came at it with a fresh mind...
			A little rest isn't going to
			change the computer analysis,
			Commander.
			I'm sure you've done a complete
			investigation. If you wish to
			continue it, you have my support
			of course. But we'll be reaching
			the Beta Agni system shortly.
			I expect you to be rested.
			I understand, Captain.
			Dismissed.
			Geordi... I understand how much
			we want... even need to explain
			an accident like this. Sometimes
			there just aren't any
			explanations.
			For an android without feelings...
			he sure managed to evoke them in
			others.
			We must select an officer to
			replace Data at Ops.
			Recommendations?
			My first choice would be
			Lieutenant Worf, sir.
			Mine as well. Make it so.
			(One line of Shakespeare that
			provides the perfect epitaph to
			Data.)
			You're still wearing your uniform.
			Why?
			I am a Starfleet officer.
			You're not in Starfleet any
			longer. It's time you adjusted
			your program to accept reality.
			Even if I chose to do so, it is
			doubtful whether my programming
			could be sufficiently altered to
			accede to your wishes.
			Oh?
			I have been designed with a
			fundamental respect for life in
			all its forms... and a strong
			inhibition against causing harm
			to living beings.
			A military pacifist. What a
			marvelous paradox. Tell me --
			whose dreadful decision was it
			to enlist you in Starfleet?
			It was ultimately my own decision.
			My skills seemed appropriate...
			My dear Data, it was a mistake.
			A grievous error. You no more
			belong in Starfleet than I belong
			in a verbal contract. Have you
			killed yet, Data?
			No, but I am programmed with the
			ability to use deadly force in
			a cause of defense.
			Shame on you.
			Shame on you. How neatly you
			rationalize your capabilities.
			How can you casually accept your
			role in murder?
			I would not participate in murder.
			Perhaps you misunderstand...
			Can't you see how much better it
			will be for you here... the
			intellectual rewards, our own
			personal exploration of the
			galaxy... I am at war with no
			one... I have liberated you.
			You are a fine debater, sir. It
			is a shame you have used your
			verbal gifts for mere hucksterism
			and the advancement of your own
			greed.
			You're going to be more of a
			challenge than I thought. Put
			on the new clothes and sit in your
			chair.
			I must decline.
			Finoplak. One hundred denkirs.
			Here's something for your logic
			circuits to analyze.
			Don't worry -- the solvent won't
			damage your skin. But in minutes
			it will completely dissolve your
			uniform.
			I'd be delighted to have you go
			naked... I assume you have no
			vanity. But I would guess that
			decency is the rule of your
			Starfleet training.
			So, decide which alternative you
			dislike the least.
			Decide by dinnertime tonight.
			I have invited a guest to meet
			you. I expect you to be as
			entertaining with him as you have
			been with me.
			Proceeding with departure.
			Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
			for docking, level one
			precautions remain in effect.
			I did miss something.
			Your first watch on Ops?
			I've served at the position
			before.
			I've been concerned about you.
			About me? Why?
			Because I know how I'd feel if
			I were asked to replace Data at
			his station.
			Bridge.
			Promotion due to the death of a
			crewmate is commonplace on Klingon
			ships.
			I know... but this isn't a Klingon
			ship... and Data was your friend.
			And it is the second time you've
			replaced a crewmate who's died.
			I honor Data's memory as I did
			Lieutenant Yar's by attempting
			to perform their duties as well
			as they did.
			In true Klingon fashion.
			I appreciate your... concern.
			Okay, computer, now replay shuttle
			audio transmission... time index
			zero-four-two-three...
			Data's second trip...
			Proceeding with departure.
			Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
			for docking, level one precautions
			remain in effect.
			Shuttle has cleared Jovis cargo
			bay.
			It sounds the same as the first
			trip...
			Exactly the same. That's
			protocol. And that's Data.
			Following protocol to the letter.
			Computer, replay shuttle audio
			transmission, time index
			zero-four-three-nine...
			Third and final trip.
			Loading is complete. I am
			proceeding with departure.
			Enterprise Shuttlebay Two, prepare
			for docking, level one precautions
			remain in effect.
			That's it. The last
			communication.
			He didn't report when the shuttle
			had cleared the cargo bay of the
			Jovis.
			Of course, there really wasn't
			any reason for him to make voice
			contact. He knew we'd be
			monitoring his position... and
			any other pilot might not bother.
			But Data... not following standard
			procedures?
			What do you think it means?
			I'm not sure, Wes. I suppose he
			could've been too busy... maybe
			he saw something was wrong...
			Without communicating it? That
			doesn't sound like Data either.
			Which means maybe something was
			wrong with him. But there's no
			other indication of that. In
			anything he said or did during
			the mission. None.
			I'd sure like to talk to the last
			people who saw him alive.
			Did I mention that I've added a
			Veltan sex idol to my
			collection...
			I have four of them.
			With the pearls intact?
			The pearls were added by the
			Ferengi agents to increase the
			value. Veltans would never
			dishonor their gods with garish
			jewelry.
			What... is that?
			Something new? And you didn't
			tell me...
			Mister Data, I'm delighted to see
			you have dressed for the occasion.
			Say hello to my very good friend
			Palor Toff...
			Come now, don't be shy... as if
			you could be shy...
			A mannequin of some sort?
			It is not a mannequin. It is
			Data... formerly Lieutenant
			Commander Data of the Federation
			Starfleet. The only sentient
			android in existence.
			It doesn't look particularly
			sentient right now...
			I fear he's playing a little game
			with us...
			Well, someone certainly has
			played a game on you, Fajo.
			I assure you it is the real thing.
			Tell him.
			It is an android.
			A most unusual one.
			Perhaps its batteries have run
			down. Did it come with a
			guarantee? I hope.
			I am not amused. I demand you
			behave normally.
			Dammit, I know you can hear me!
			He falls well.
			I apologize for this.
			Don't be silly, my friend. I'm
			having a delightful visit.
			Come along, Varria. You're much
			more fun to play with than Fajo's
			new toy.
			You will regret it.
			Entering the Beta Agni system,
			Commander.
			Slow to impulse, Mister Crusher.
			La Forge to bridge.
			Go ahead, Commander.
			Captain, a class two probe has
			been loaded with the hytritium
			compound and is ready to launch.
			Acknowledged.
			Approaching Beta Agni Two.
			Mister Crusher, take us into a
			close orbit. Mister Data, scan
			the --
			My apologies, Mister Worf. Scan
			the colony's subsurface water.
			Scanning... Tricyanate
			contamination is confirmed.
			Levels approaching forty-two parts
			per million.
			Area affected?
			Thirty square kilometers.
			Any indication of the source?
			Highest concentration is eight
			kilometers west of the colony.
			Adjust target coordinates.
			Aye, Commander.
			Captain, based on these figures,
			the eighty kilos of hytritium we
			have should be enough to
			neutralize the contamination.
			We're approaching the target
			coordinates.
			Launch probe.
			Probe on target. Hytritium
			entering water table...
			disbursement slightly faster than
			expected.
			Sir... something unusual.
			Specify.
			I'm getting concentrated
			tricyanate readings of seventy
			grams per cubic centimeter at the
			source coordinates. Much higher
			than would normally occur.
			Any theories, Mister Worf... ?
			Possibly the result of seismic
			activity.
			Computer, report on geologic
			instability on Beta Agni Two.
			No significant geological activity
			has been recorded on Beta Agni Two
			since the settlement of the
			Federation colony.
			Another theory, Mister Worf?
			Number One, perhaps you should
			take an away team down and have
			a closer look.
			Yes, sir.
			Doctor Crusher, report to
			Transporter Room Three.
			On my way.
			Mister Worf... ?
			Our relationship is about to
			change.
			You may expect me to use every
			means at my disposal to resist
			your wishes.
			No, from now on, you will comply.
			You will not argue. You will
			begin by sitting in your chair.
			Sit!
			I do not intend to sit in the
			chair.
			You will. You don't believe it
			yet. But you will.
			Have you ever seen one of these,
			Data?
			I do not recognize it.
			I'm not surprised. This is the
			prototype of the Varon-T
			disruptor.
			The Varon-T disruptor is banned
			in the Federation.
			Yes. Only five were ever
			manufactured. I own four. I
			sleep with one under my pillow.
			I sleep very well knowing it's
			there.
			It is a most lethal weapon.
			Oh, it's much more than lethal,
			Data. It's vicious. It tears
			a body from the inside out, quite
			slowly by phaser standards, a
			tortuous, painful death.
			I've always wanted to try it.
			I am prepared to die. However,
			I doubt very much that you would
			destroy me since you assign so
			much value to possessing me.
			That goes without saying.
			Please. Come in.
			Sit down, my dear. Right here
			on the sofa.
			How long have you been with me,
			Varria?
			Fourteen years.
			Fourteen wonderful years. She
			was barely an adult when I found
			her. Idealistic. Naive. Full
			of dreams. And I made all her
			dreams come true. Didn't I? At
			a slight cost of course. She had
			to lose all those pesky ideals.
			But then maybe that was what made
			these years so wonderful, watching
			her lose them one by one until
			none were left.
			I'm going to miss you.
			Fajo...
			The contamination has been
			neutralized. Water's clean.
			Most curious.
			The process of neutralization
			should have taken several hours.
			Naturally occuring tricyanate
			doesn't respond this quickly.
			Are you saying this was not
			naturally occuring?
			There are no natural trace
			elements present in these
			tricyanate crystals.
			If it's artificial, then we're
			talking about sabotage.
			With tricyanate? That's hard to
			believe.
			It's slow to assimilate,
			difficult to replicate, and hard
			to transport. There are a lot
			easier ways to poison a water
			supply. A lot more effective ways
			too. Toxins that can't be
			neutralized. Bacteriologic agents
			with no cures at all.
			Can you think of any reason why
			a saboteur might choose
			tricyanate?
			Not really.
			It might pass for a natural
			disaster. And since there's only
			one way to treat it... with
			hytritium, maybe someone figured
			we wouldn't locate any... it is
			hard to come by.
			You know it really was lucky,
			wasn't it... ?
			That we were able to find
			hytritium when we did. Just
			enough hytritium for this crisis.
			Fajo showed up in the right place
			at the right time... just when
			we needed him the most...
			You're suggesting he created the
			problem just to solve it?
			Possibly.
			To make a profit from his sale
			of hytritium... ?
			That doesn't add up. The cost
			of producing tricyanate is too
			expensive. He wouldn't make a
			profit... quite the contrary.
			Then, why would he do it?
			What could he want?
			Computer, biographical file on
			trader Kivas Fajo.
			Accessing file... Kivas Fajo: A
			Zibalian trader of the Stacius
			trade guild... a noted
			collector...
			... of rare and valuable objects
			including the Rejac Crystal, The
			Starry Night by Van Gogh and
			the Lawmim Galactopedia...
			educated on Iraatan Five...
			Computer, that will suffice.
			A rare and valuable object...
			If Data wasn't on the shuttle...
			Mister Crusher...
			Aye, sir...
			Set course for the site of the
			shuttlepod explosion. Warp eight.
			He would have killed me.
			It seemed a distinct possibility.
			I'm sorry I did this to you.
			You can stand up if you want to.
			You're... you're not what I
			thought you'd be...
			What did you expect?
			A machine. A robot, I guess.
			Not anything so... well almost
			human.
			Thank you.
			Is something troubling you,
			Varria?
			Your lips. They're warm.
			Thirty-seven degrees Celsius.
			Adjustable. I chose this
			temperature to approximate human
			skin texture.
			How human are you?
			Physically, I am capable of
			performing many human functions.
			However, I have no emotional
			responses.
			You're not the first man I've
			known like that.
			Have you ever made love, Data?
			I have had one sexual encounter.
			But I am incapable of making love
			as you describe it since I cannot
			feel love.
			Would you... do it with me?
			Why?
			Why not?
			It is an act that symbolizes the
			highest level of intimacy between
			beings. I have told you that I
			am unable to feel intimacy. I
			find it difficult to accept that
			you could have intimate feelings
			toward me under these conditions.
			Therefore you are either simply
			curious. Or you have been sent
			by Kivas Fajo to test my sexual
			abilities.
			You are just too smart for your
			own good, android.
			I was hoping to see a little
			spontaneity but obviously neither
			one of you is capable of it. This
			mating dance is really quite dull.
			We'll try it again tomorrow. You
			may leave, Varria.
			The Jovis has a maximum speed of
			warp three. He's had twenty-three
			hours... so we can define a
			perimeter of point-one-oh-two
			light years as his possible
			range...
			And Fajo doesn't know we're onto
			him, so he probably isn't taxing
			his engines by going at top speed.
			He could have made it to the Nel
			Bato system... maybe even the
			Giles Belt...
			He's a trader... he doesn't
			attract customers by being hard
			to find...
			We could put out a coded level
			two query to all Federation
			ouposts within the perimeter...
			Make it so.
			If I help you escape... will you
			take me with you?
			This is not another test. He's
			asleep. And there isn't much
			time...
			The consequences to you if we're
			caught...
			I know the consequences.
			Fourteen years... you learn a few
			things...
			There's an escape pod in the aft
			cargo bay...
			Sir, affirmative response from
			station Lya Four...
			Fajo spent almost half a day in
			orbit... departed just over seven
			hours ago.
			Mister Crusher, new
			coordinates... set a course for
			Lya Four...
			Coordinates already laid in,
			sir...
			Engage.
			Perhaps if I attempted to
			communicate with the Enterprise...
			You can't... Fajo has
			communications access restricted
			to the bridge. Once we're out,
			the shuttlepod will emit an
			emergency beacon. We'll have to
			hope somebody responds before
			Fajo is able to destroy us.
			I have been trained in evasive
			maneuvers...
			We'll need a few.
			Get ready... As soon as I
			initiate the escape sequence, an
			alarm will sound... we won't have
			much time...
			Varria...
			This is your fault. You knew the
			price for disobedience. And so
			did she.
			Well, there's always another
			Varria.
			You can't hurt me.
			A fundamental respect for all
			living beings. That is what you
			said. I'm a living being...
			therefore you cannot harm me.
			You will surrender yourself to
			the authorities.
			Or what? You'll fire?
			An empty threat and we both know
			it.
			Accept your fate. You will return
			to your chair and you will sit
			there. You will entertain me and
			you will entertain my guests.
			And if you do not, I will simply
			kill somebody else...
			Him or him maybe... anyone, it
			does not matter... and their blood
			will be on your hands too... just
			like poor Varria's.
			Your only alternative, Data, is
			to fire. Murder me. That's all
			you have to do. Go ahead. All
			your troubles are over. Fire.
			Are you searching through your
			program for a loophole, perhaps?
			Is there one? If only you could
			feel rage over Varria's death...
			feel the need for revenge... then
			maybe you could fire. But you're

			anything, do you? It's just
			another interesting intellectual

			curiosities.
			I cannot permit this to continue.
			You can't. Your program won't
			allow it. You cannot fire. You
			will not...
			I'm reading a weapon in transit
			with Commander Data. It seems
			to have discharged, sir.
			Discharged... ?
			I'm deactivating the weapon.
			Welcome back, Mister Data. Are
			you all right?
			Yes, Commander. Please arrange
			to take Kivas Fajo into custody
			for murder, kidnapping, theft...
			Arrangements have already been
			made.
			A Varon-T disruptor. It belongs
			to Fajo.
			Mister O'Brien says the weapon
			was in a state of discharge...
			Perhaps something happened during
			transport, Commander.
			So. Have you come for your final
			satisfaction? You wish me to
			repent? Beg for mercy? You'll
			have none of it from me.
			I expected none.
			It seems our roles are reversed...
			aren't they, Data... you are now
			the collector... and I...
			... am in your cage.
			So it seems.
			Do not count me out so quickly.
			I had you once. I may have you
			back in my collection again.
			Unlikely. Your collection has
			been confiscated pending your
			trial. All of your stolen
			possessions are being returned
			to their rightful owners.
			You have lost everything you
			value.
			I'm sure that gives you great
			pleasure.
			No, sir, it does not. I do not
			feel pleasure. I am only an
			android.
