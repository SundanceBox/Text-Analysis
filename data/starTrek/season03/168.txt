			Captain's log, Stardate 43779.3.
			The Enterprise is preparing
			detailed atmospheric charts of the
			Hayashi system. Although tedious,
			this endeavor is the first step
			toward planet colonization.
			Sensors report the USS Hood
			closing on an intercept course
			at high warp.
			That's odd... I wasn't notified
			of a rendezvous.
			They seem to be in an awful hurry.
			Sir, we are being hailed on a
			secured channel by Captain DeSoto.
			On screen.
			Sorry to sneak up on you like
			that, Jean-Luc --
			Robert, why didn't you inform
			us --
			-- Out here, you never know
			who's listening. Keeps you on
			your toes, anyway. Hey, Will,
			you getting soft on that luxury
			liner?
			So, old friend. How are you?
			Ah, you know, they send you
			Galaxy-Class boys out here to the
			far reaches. Me, I'm hauling my
			butt back and forth between
			starbases --
			But not today.
			Nope. Starfleet's got new orders
			for you. This is top priority.
			They need the fastest ship in
			the fleet -- and the best people.
			That's you.
			If time is so important, why
			didn't they transmit the orders
			by subspace?
			They're worried about Romulan
			eavesdropping on this one. And
			we've got a passenger for you.
			Hard to send by subspace.
			What sort of passenger?
			Mission specialist. He'll bring
			your orders aboard with him.
			Name's Tam Elbrun.
			Elbrun? You mean Tam Elbrun as
			in the Ghorusda disaster?
			The same.
			What can I say? Your orders are
			to cooperate fully with him.
			Best of luck, folks. Hood out.
			Sir, the Hood is slowing to
			impulse.
			Mister Data, come with me --
			Captain, let me come with you to
			greet Tam --
			You know him?
			I do... He was at the university
			on Betazed when I studied
			psychology there.
			Ah, I see. He was a colleague,
			then.
			No, sir. He was a patient...
			Tam is a telepath of extraordinary
			talent, even for a Betazoid. He's
			a specialist in first contact with
			new life-forms, and... a rather
			unique person.
			He's not what you might expect,
			Captain.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
			I'm --
			Captain Picard. Here --
			You want to know all about your
			mission. Everything's on there.
			Orders and briefings. Destination
			and heading, all that.
			I sensed you were out here.
			How've you been?
			Fine, but Tam, I...
			Sir --
			Who -- what are you?
			My name is Data.
			Incredible, an android. I can't
			read you at all. It's like you're
			not there.
			Oh. You better hurry up to the
			bridge with that. Captain wants
			you to run the orders, scan the
			technical schematics, and be ready
			to brief him in ten minutes.
			Right?
			Number One?
			Riker here.
			Meet Mister Data on the bridge.
			He has our orders and new heading.
			Aye, sir.
			And assemble the bridge staff for
			a mission briefing in -- fifteen
			minutes. Picard out.
			Mister Elbrun. Would you --
			Like to see my quarters. No.
			I'd rather get this briefing over
			with. Then be left alone until
			I'm needed.
			I've heard something about
			Ghorusda. Weren't about forty
			people killed --
			Forty-seven, including the captain
			of the Adelphi -- and two friends
			from my class at the Academy.
			Sorry. What happened?
			It was a first contact situation.
			The Ghorusdans values are so
			complex, and so different, that
			the Federation sent along a
			specialist. To prevent
			misunderstanding.
			That was Tam Elbrun? And what
			happened was his fault?
			Not directly. Board of inquiry
			blamed Captain Darson's
			carelessness about Ghorusdan
			cultural taboos.
			But if Elbrun's so good, why
			didn't he warn Darson? What was
			he there for, if he couldn't sense
			that much hostility?
			Commander, Geordi... do you ever
			feel as if I am not "there?" That
			is to say... not "here."
			You seem to be all here.
			Our destination is the Beta
			Stromgren system, following the
			path of the Vega Nine probe.
			That's twenty-three parsecs beyond
			our furthest manned explorations.
			That is correct, Commander.
			Apparently the probe has
			discovered...
			...Astonishing.
			This is the star Beta Stromgren...
			Scientists have discovered that
			it is in the final stages of an
			alternating cycle of expansion
			and collapse, which will soon
			result in a supernova.
			However, the long-range unmanned
			probe which Starfleet sent to
			observe the process has discovered
			something much more --
			Oh, Data -- don't waste time.
			They call it "Tin Man". The Vega
			Probe found it orbiting Stromgren.
			Looks like a ship of some kind.
			Its energy source is unknown.
			The people who've studied the
			transmissions think it's a
			starship. And they're sure it's
			alive.
			Alive? How so?
			A cybernetic organism -- like the
			Borg?
			No, no, NO! Here --
			Starfleet believes it's an
			organic creature, born in space,
			living its life in the wastes
			between stars.
			No one knows where it came from,
			or why it's here now. And we're
			going to meet it. We're going
			to talk to it.
			I'm going to talk to it.
			Have attempts been made --
			To communicate with it by
			subspace. Of course --
			linguacode, universal translation,
			all that. It won't work. Tin Man
			is too different. Direct
			mind-to-mind contact is our only
			hope.
			The opportunity for discovery is
			extraordinary -- but I don't yet
			understand Starfleet's urgency
			--
			The Romulans --
			Hell, I forgot -- the Romulans...
			They claim the sector of space
			in which Beta Stromgren is
			located.
			The Romulans claim all that is
			within their field of vision.
			And they routinely monitor the
			telemetry of our deep-space
			probes.
			So it's quite certain they'll
			be sending a ship of their own
			to investigate this Tin Man.
			No... Actually, they're sending
			two. Uh, Data --
			That is correct. Starbase one
			twenty-three detected two
			D'daridex class cruisers on an
			intercept course.
			The top speed of this class vessel
			is known to be less than our own,
			sir. We therefore have some
			advantage.
			So, it's a race?
			An alien intelligence -- a new
			life-form -- representing a
			technology far beyond that of
			either the Romulans or ourselves.
			The Romulans will take whatever
			measures -- military or otherwise
			-- are required to secure the
			creature for study.
			Study as in dissect, I'd bet.
			Data, you're our resident honor
			student in exobiology. I'm
			assigning you to head up life
			sciences on this mission.
			Yes, sir.
			Excellent.
			Meeting adjourned, then.
			So, Data -- I guess you're the
			brains of this outfit, huh?
			Mister Elbrun -- one reason I want
			you to work closely with a member
			of my staff is to avoid any
			further... omissions. The
			possibility of an encounter with
			Romulans on this mission is hardly
			trivial. Yet you --
			All right, all right... I should
			have brought up the Romulans
			earlier, but I was distracted.
			And no, Billy boy, I wasn't
			"distracted" on Ghorusda.
			If Darson had listened to me, no
			one would have died. And I
			don't care whether you believe
			that or not.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43782.6.
			Travelling at top warp, we are
			still several days from rendezvous
			with the mysterious entity which
			Starfleet has christened Tin Man.
			My immediate concern is with Tam
			Elbrun. Starfleet considers his
			unique abilities crucial to our
			mission. Yet he seems to me...
			unstable.
			Well, according to his medical
			records and psych profile, he's
			very high on the ESP scale. A
			sort of prodigy.
			A prodigy? In what sense?
			In most Betazoids their telepathic
			gifts develop at adolescence.
			They're not born reading minds?
			No. Except... for some reason
			that no one understands,
			occasionally a Betazoid child is
			born different.
			How "different?"
			Born with their telepathic
			abilities "switched on."
			Most Betazoids born like that
			never lead a normal life.
			The noise of other people's
			thoughts and feelings must be...
			overwhelming. Incomprehensible...
			especially for a child.
			And painful. Early diagnosis and
			special training helped Tam adjust
			-- but he has some problems.
			You mentioned a hospitalization
			--
			For stress. Repeatedly,
			throughout his life.
			I always wonder... what holds one
			person together through that kind
			of struggle, while another goes
			under?
			Yes, well, he's evidently done
			more than "hold together". He's
			the indispensable man -- the
			Federation's finest specialist
			in communication with unknown
			life-forms.
			It looks like the more unusual a
			life form is, the better he likes
			it. His personnel file shows that
			he's gravitated toward assignments
			that isolate him from other
			humanoids.
			Commander Data, I'm picking up
			an unusual echo from my
			navigational sensors.
			There is something there, sir,
			tracking us -- matching our speed
			and heading. Something which
			doesn't fully register on our
			instruments.
			Since there is no known natural
			phenomenon capable of travel at
			warp velocities, there are but
			two possibilities: either it is
			a sensor malfunction, or it is
			another ship, following us
			covertly.
			It is not a sensor malfunction.
			Agreed.
			A Romulan ship? With their
			cloaking device, we shouldn't pick
			them up at all.
			Unless they're pulling so much
			power for something else that they
			can't fully cloak.
			Like what?
			Ask the Romulans... if it is the
			Romulans.
			Lieutenant, continue monitoring
			the precise position of the echo
			-- at any sudden change in its
			behavior, initiate Yellow Alert.
			Aye, sir.
			Come in.
			How're things in the land of the
			living?
			I thought you might be lonely.
			No one sees you, except Data.
			Lonely? I can hear everything
			that everyone on this ship thinks.
			No one besides you seems to be
			missing my charming --
			You want them to dislike you.
			Why?
			Because I'm not a nice guy?
			Okay -- because they scare me.
			Too many minds, Deanna. I can't
			shut them out -- never could
			learn. All their loves, their
			hates, their fears, their...
			needs. It's like a tide that
			never ebbs.
			I could drown.
			I remember.
			You understood -- at least a
			little -- how I felt.
			I see you finally found a place
			to fit... people to care about...
			And you're still looking.
			Then there's Ghorusda. I've got
			enough doubts about my...
			reliability... without having to
			listen to Riker's, and Picard's
			--
			What happened there?
			I thought everyone knew --
			No. What happened to you?
			Maybe... I got too involved with
			the Ghorusdans, with their point
			of view. It happens to me. I
			wanted everyone to get along.
			I could have warned Darson more
			forcefully.
			So after that, you ran away? The
			last I heard, you were the only
			Federation delegate assigned to
			Chandra Five.
			Beautiful creatures, the
			Chandrans. Their minds are
			glacial. They have a lovely
			three-day ritual for saying
			"hello." Peaceful, untroubled
			people...
			Unlike humanoids?
			Well, except for your friend Data.
			I like him. He's... restful.
			I believe your impression of Data
			is probably unique.
			Yeah? Well, having to get to know
			someone, just once, has its appeal.
			I mean, talking to them, instead
			of getting it all at once up here
			--
			-- whether I want it or not.
			But you accepted this mission.
			You could have stayed on Chandra
			Five. You willingly came aboard
			a ship of over a thousand people
			--
			How could I not? Think of it,
			Dee. This intelligence that swims
			naked through space like a fish
			in the sea. Totally alien,
			mysterious -- not like us at all.
			Ancient. And alone.
			So lonely, for so long.
			How can you know that? Tam?
			You're in contact with it. With
			Tin Man. Aren't you?
			No -- well... yes. A little.
			Not quite on a conscious level.
			But we're still light-years away.
			That must be impossible -- even
			for you.
			Impossible for me. Maybe not
			impossible for Tin Man.
			Status, Number One?
			We've reached the outer regions
			of the Beta Stromgren system, sir.
			On course for orbital intercept
			of Tin Man, e.t.a. eighteen minutes.
			Grand.
			Not altogether. Astrophysics
			reports that the star's rate of
			collapse is increasing -- it could
			go supernova within the next few
			days.
			Captain, we are receiving relayed
			sensor data, from the Vega Probe
			-- including visuals.
			On screen, Mister Data.
			Magnify.
			Remarkable. Computer -- locate
			Tam Elbrun.
			Tam Elbrun is in Turbolift One,
			en route to the Main Bridge.
			Of course.
			Commander...
			Problem, Worf?
			Sir, I am reading a wave front
			of ionized particles preceding
			the object which is tracking us.
			Go to Yellow Alert.
			On screen.
			Romulan warbird, closing.
			They're arming main distruptors,
			Captain.
			Go to Red Alert -- shields at
			maximum.
			Worf, arm photon torpedoes and
			stand by.
			Aye, sir.
			I thought you said the Enterprise
			was faster than this Romulan --
			In fact, we are, Commander.
			However --
			Evasive, Mister Worf. Data, open
			hailing frequencies --
			I guarantee that they don't want
			to talk to you, Captain.
			The Romulan has passed us, sir,
			and recloaked.
			Damage report.
			No casualties reported. Seventy
			percent loss to main shields, sir.
			Captain, their attack on us was
			incidental.
			Incidental?
			Yes. To delay us.
			Captain, it would appear that the
			Romulan's intent is to contact
			Tin Man first, at any cost.
			According to my sensor readings,
			the warbird exceeded maximum
			engine output by nearly thirty
			percent... They appear to have
			suffered irreparable damage to
			their warp coils.
			So -- they kept up with us by
			sacrificing their ability to
			return to Romulan space.
			A one-way trip.
			There is one more trailing us,
			Captain -- a day or two behind.
			Data's right -- this one's job
			is to beat us to Tin Man at any
			cost.
			You read all this, telepathically
			--
			-- In the mind of the Romulan
			commander, during the attack.
			Very well, then. Mister Crusher
			all stop.
			Aye, sir.
			Commander La Forge.
			La Forge here.
			Geordi -- how long to restore
			shields?
			Working on it. Computer,
			reconfigure structural integrity
			power to feed inner deflector
			grid.
			Unable to comply. Requested
			reroute would compromise
			operational safety limits.
			To hell with the limits.
			Override. Authorization La Forge
			theta two-nine-nine-seven.
			Rerouting structural integrity
			power supply.
			Russell! Watch the lateral grid
			balance.
			Nope, too much. We gotta do it
			manually.
			La Forge to bridge.
			Go ahead.
			Captain, I'm trying to feed the
			inner grid by stealing some power
			from the structural integrity
			field. You should have partial
			shielding in thirty minutes.
			You have ten.
			Picard out.
			The Romulans wish the honor of
			the first contact, let them have
			it.
			You're out of your mind, Picard!
			What if the Romulans find a way
			to persuade Tin Man --
			I think the chances of that are
			remote. And, Mister Elbrun, if
			you'll be still you may learn --
			What?
			That being first, at any cost,
			is not always the point.
			Data, while we await repairs, I
			want Life Sciences and Engineering
			to continue collecting information
			on the alien. Query the Vega Nine
			probe, and the long-range sensors.
			Yes, sir.
			You do a lot of your work here?
			Yes. I have configured these
			instruments to display information
			with greater speed and efficiency
			than stations used by the others.
			Nice. A little Spartan.
			Spartan?
			Lots of work space, not much room
			to live. I don't guess you sleep?
			I have tried it, from time to
			time. But you are correct. I
			do not require rest.
			But you paint.
			The creature's anatomy appears
			most peculiar.
			In what way?
			It is indeed laid out as a vessel,
			with what appear to be corridors
			and chambers. An internal
			environment suitable for carbon
			based life forms is being
			maintained. Yet there is no
			evidence of a crew aboard.
			Tin Man is a living being yet it
			was bred or adapted itself to
			serve a purpose. I find that very
			interesting.
			Why? Must living beings have a
			purpose? Or do we exist for no
			reason but to exist?
			I do not believe I am qualified
			to express an opinion.
			Ah, Data -- you're uniquely
			qualified. You think a great deal
			about humanity -- and you're an
			honest researcher. You don't
			treat anything as trivial, or
			irrelevant. You want to try it
			all.
			You said in the Transporter Room
			that you could not read my mind.
			True enough. But I think I
			understand you pretty well.
			It worries you -- that I can't
			read your mind?
			Perhaps there is nothing to read.
			Nothing other than mechanism and
			algorithmic response --
			Perhaps you're just different.
			Not a sin, you know -- though you
			may have heard otherwise.
			Captain, the Romulan ship is
			hailing the alien using their
			equivalent of linguacode.
			Response?
			None so far, Commander.
			Why should it answer? What can
			it have in common with them?
			But you're so sure it'll "talk" to
			you.
			Well, I --
			Captain, the Romulans are arming
			all disruptors.
			Yellow Alert. Prepare for evasive
			action at the first change in the
			Romulans' course.
			With our shields in their present
			condition, we can't risk --
			No!
			We're not the target. It's Tin
			Man --
			What do you mean? They intend
			to destroy it?
			Those are their orders if they
			can't secure the alien.
			Increase speed to intercept the
			Romulans.
			Their lead is too great.
			Worf, hail them. I cannot allow
			--
			They won't listen to you!
			Danger... Gom-tuu... Do not allow!
			Worf! Damage report!
			Not yet available, Captain. We
			have partial failure of the main
			computer.
			You did this. You woke your Tin
			Man.
			We've got impulse power, but I've
			got to take the warp engines off
			line while we recalibrate the
			intermix regulators.
			How long?
			For just the warp drive, or for
			everything?
			All of it.
			We're looking at twenty hours
			work, double shifts.
			Geordi, we don't know that we have
			twenty hours. The star could
			explode at any time --
			I know. Okay, first we need to
			get the main computer working
			right --
			No -- fix the shields first.
			Commander, whatever Tin Man hit
			us with, it fried circuits I
			thought were unfryable.
			It's not Tin Man I'm worried
			about. It's more Romulans showing
			up.
			Right. First priority, get the
			shields up. Only, let's not have
			any more surprises till I'm done.
			Don't ask me about surprises.
			Ask Tam Elbrun.
			Brain activity suggests that
			you're coming out of a sort of
			fugue, or seizure... blood
			pressure and glucose indicative
			of general systemic stress --
			But I'm gonna live?
			No doubt about it.
			Good. I want to know exactly what
			you did. I want to know how
			closely you are in communication
			with the alien, and what you've
			learned about it. Now.
			I... just warned it, that's all.
			I've been in contact with it...
			sensing impressions from it...
			It calls itself Gomtuu. It's old,
			Captain. It's roamed the universe
			for many thousands of years.
			Where did it come from? How
			many...
			Far away, I think. Maybe beyond
			the galaxy. Once there were
			millions of them.
			Once?
			It hasn't seen another of its kind
			for millennia. It's alone. It
			may be the last of its species.
			Perhaps we can help it in some
			way. Can you ask it to return
			with us to Federation space? Or
			at least to remove itself from
			the vicinity of Beta Stromgren,
			before the star explodes?
			Captain, Gomtuu knows that the
			star will go nova soon. That's
			why it came here. It wants to die.
			Why?
			There was... an explosion, in
			space... radiation penetrated
			the outer layers. The crew...
			the crew died. Such loss... empty
			pain... Hollowness.
			Stop this! Tam -- Tam, you're
			losing yourself in this -- this
			merging.
			I -- I know.
			Tin Man hurts... and wants to die.
			I can't do any more from here.
			If you want me to really reach
			Tin Man, I've got to be in
			physical contact. I've got to
			go aboard.
			No. Absolutely out of the
			question.
			You don't trust me.
			No. I don't believe that I do.
			Tam -- when you reached out to
			the alien, to warn it -- did you
			give any thought to this vessel?
			To the danger, however
			inadvertent, the creature might
			pose to our crew? Or did you
			simply react out of instinct?
			Captain --
			Deanna -- he's right... I don't
			know what might happen -- but if
			you don't let me go, we fail in
			our mission.
			Besides, at this point, you need
			all the help you can get -- even
			Tin Man's.
			Russell -- reactivate the sensor
			assemblies.
			Okay, let's do a program reload
			on the port array only.
			Good. Computer, run level two
			diagnostic.
			Port sensor array remains offline.
			Damn.
			Riker to La Forge. How's it
			coming?
			Not great... I think all the
			control processors are shot.
			Maybe if I swap the chips from
			the secondary array, I can give
			you a minimum EM scan.
			Do it.
			Russell -- try restarting sensor
			element thirty-two only.
			Well, the good news is that we
			have partial long range sensors.
			La Forge to bridge.
			Riker here.
			I'm picking up another echo on
			the long-range sensor display
			here. You getting that on your
			panel?
			Worf?
			One moment, Commander.
			Confirmed. Sir, the other Romulan
			ship... on an intercept course.
			Geordi, are we gonna have shields
			anytime soon?
			I'm doing the best I can...
			But shields won't help if that
			star explodes.
			Data, you and Tam Elbrun seem to
			have developed an affinity. Troi,
			you've known him for years. How
			far can he be trusted?
			Captain, the issue isn't one of
			trust in Tam's intentions, but
			in his judgment. I would trust
			him to do what he believes is
			right --
			Yes, of course. But his
			judgment...
			... Is precarious. The stress of
			exposure to so many minds on the
			ship has been bad enough. Now
			he's strongly drawn to this
			creature. I'm afraid for him.
			Afraid of what?
			I sense that the alien is somehow
			calling him. If we allow him to
			do as he insists -- to beam over
			-- I'm afraid that we'll lose him
			to it.
			That he will lose himself.
			Captain, I agree that Tam's
			motives are trustworthy. I do
			not believe it is possible that
			he might act against us, or cause
			Tin Man to act against us out of
			malice.
			If Tam breaks down over there,
			we'll be no closer to
			accomplishing our mission,
			Captain. It would be a grave
			mistake.
			Thank you both.
			Captain, the Romulan has
			uncloaked.
			Data?
			I am puzzled, sir. We have come
			this far. But you may not allow
			Tam to fulfill his mission.
			Data -- Elbrun warned Tin Man,
			and the first thing it did was
			to destroy a space vessel.
			I think I understand, sir.
			If you feel that the risk is too
			great to send Tam Elbrun, alone,
			then send me with him.
			Counselor Troi understands him
			better.
			But I distress him less.
			It is humanity he is fleeing.
			I can serve as an intermediary...
			a bridge back, and a reminder of
			his obligations... both to us
			and to Tin Man.
			Status Number One?
			Shields at forty percent, Captain.
			We can maneuver on impulse.
			Phasers available on manual, sir.
			computer target lock not
			functioning.
			Well, let's hope they're in a mood
			to talk. Open hailing
			frequencies.
			Romulan vessel -- this is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the USS
			Enterprise.
			Enterprise -- your presence here
			is a violation of Romulan space.
			You will leave immediately.
			We are not familiar with the terms
			of your claim on this sector,
			Commander. We are here engaged
			in scientific research. Do you
			wish to participate --
			We have monitored the destruction
			of our sister ship by the star
			creature. We claim right of
			vengeance. We will destroy the
			alien.
			If you interfere, we will destroy
			you as well.
			Captain's log, Supplemental.
			Light-years beyond the edges of
			explored space, and virtually
			disabled, our survival may now
			depend upon Tam Elbrun's
			telepathic rapport with an alien
			intelligence.
			Picard to Tam Elbrun.
			Captain?
			Report to Transporter Room Six
			immediately.
			Captain, I don't --
			Commander Data will meet you
			there.
			Counselor, we no longer have a
			choice.
			No... Too much. Too much.
			Tam?
			I can't.
			Data to Enterprise. Come in
			Enterprise.
			No... No, don't.
			If it is harming you, we must
			return.
			Enterprise, respond.
			I cannot contact the ship.
			It's alright... Gomtuu tried to
			communicate a lifetime of
			experiences to me in a few
			seconds.
			It's alright now.
			O'Brien to bridge.
			Go ahead, Chief.
			I lost the transporter lock on
			them. Some kind of force field
			went up.
			Confirmed. The alien has thrown
			up a shield -- it's blocking all
			our sensors.
			The Romulans' weapons systems are
			now at full power.
			Red Alert... Mister Worf... arm
			photon torpedos.
			Yes...
			There is a large chamber twenty
			meters ahead.
			Yeah, I know.
			I know everything, now. Come on.
			Intriguing.
			This is the control center where
			Gomtuu's crew guided their
			journeys. The ship and the crew
			existed symbiotically.
			They needed one another. When
			Gomtuu had no one left to care
			for, it no longer had a reason
			to exist.
			And is that the purpose of
			existence? To care for someone?
			It is for me.
			Deanna was right. I'll lose
			myself here.
			An invitation.
			I must remind you that our
			objective is to bring Tin Man out
			of danger and report our findings
			to Starfleet.
			I'm not going back, Data. I'm
			staying here.
			Captain Picard, if you interfere
			with us, we will fire upon you
			as well --
			Commander -- we are prepared to
			defend the life of the alien.
			Shields up.
			Power levels aboard the alien are
			increasing, sir.
			Captain, the diameter of the star
			has decreased by one hundred
			thousand kilometers.
			It's beginning.
			Explain to them... make them
			understand.
			But our mission...
			... is to save Tin Man and I
			will... but he's going to save
			me as well. All my life I've
			waited for this. A chance to
			find peace. Finally all the
			the voices are silent. Only Tin
			Man speaks to me now.
			Don't you see, Data? This is
			where I belong.
			The star is gonna go any minute,
			sir.
			The Romulans know that as well
			as we do.
			Power levels aboard Tin Man
			increasing beyond our sensor
			range.
			Conn -- report.
			Dead stop, Captain. Sir--
			We've been thrown clear of Beta
			Stromgren. Distance -- three
			point eight billion kilometers.
			There is no sign of Tin Man or
			the Romulans, sir.
			Captain -- on screen!
			Data.
			Sir?
			Data -- what happened, over there?
			Difficult to explain, Captain.
			Tam?
			I believe he has found what he
			was looking for, Counselor.
			Captain's log, supplemental. With
			all main systems at least
			temporarily restored, we are
			proceeding to Starbase one fifty-two 
			for inspection and additional repairs.
			We have had no further encounter
			with the Romulans. As for the
			whereabouts of Tin Man, and Tam
			Elbrun -- we can only speculate.
			You sent for me?
			Tam's final request was for me
			to explain his decision to the
			crew. But I believe his hope was
			that you would understand.
			What did happen, Data?
			I witnessed something remarkable.
			Individually they were both so...
			Wounded? Incomplete?
			Yes. But no longer. Through
			their joining they have been
			healed. Grief was transmuted to
			joy. Loneliness to belonging.
			Data, you do understand...
			Yes, Counselor, when Tin Man
			returned me to the Enterprise I
			realized that this was where I
			belong.
