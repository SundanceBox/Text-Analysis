			Captain's log, Stardate 43685.2
			As part of a continuing exchange
			program, the Enterprise is taking
			aboard a Klingon officer to return
			the recent visit of Commander
			Riker to the cruiser Pagh.
			We must take care that while he
			is with us, Commander Kurn is
			accorded all the rights and
			responsibilities due the first
			officer of this ship. If he
			should feel patronized in any
			way...
			We'd know about it, sir. One does
			not patronize a Klingon warrior.
			I'm quite sure your experience
			aboard the Pagh will prove
			invaluable during the commander's
			tour. Be sure that the crew is
			prepared for any... unusual
			orders.
			The Klingons are very thorough,
			Captain. I'm sure Commander Kurn
			has studied for his assignment
			with us just as I studied to serve
			with them.
			I understand that he specifically
			requested the Enterprise...
			Commander Kurn is ready for
			transport, Captain.
			Energize.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise,
			Commander. I am Captain Picard.
			Thank... you, Captain. I am ready
			for duty.
			This is Commander William Riker
			who will be yielding the first
			officer's position to you during
			your tour...
			You are relieved.
			May I take my station, Captain?
			I thought that I might show you
			your quarters...
			I am ready for duty, sir. I ask
			that I be allowed to take my
			station.
			Very well... If you will
			accompany us to the bridge...
			May I present your bridge crew...
			Unnecessary, Captain. I am
			prepared to take command.
			Proceed.
			I am Kurn, commander rank, Klingon
			Defense Force. You will address
			me as "Commander" or "sir" at all
			times.
			I am fully aware of all Starfleet
			regulations. They will be
			strictly adhered to by all
			personnel while I am in command.
			It is my intention to bring a
			sense of discipline that you may
			not be accustomed to.
			With your permission, of course,
			Captain.
			By all means, Commander.
			Do you wish to speak, Acting
			Ensign Wesley Crusher?
			Nosir, Commander, sir.
			I have studied all your service
			records. Impressive. We shall
			see if you live up to your
			reputations. The crew awaits your
			orders, Captain.
			Take us into the outer cometary
			cloud, Commander.
			Set course one-one-four, mark
			two-three-zero, one-third impulse
			power!
			Aye sir.
			Execute!
			Execute!
			Engaged. Increasing to one-third
			impulse power, sir.
			Mind if I join you?
			No, sir.
			Something wrong, Wesley?
			No, sir.
			Commander Kurn perhaps?
			He... just doesn't seem to like
			me, sir. I can't do anything
			right for him. Every time I
			respond to one of his orders...
			he jumps down my throat. I'm not
			sure what I'm doing wrong.
			He's just...
			Problem, Geordi?
			Well, sir... it's our new first
			officer.
			I take it he found something wrong
			in Engineering?
			Just the entire section. He made
			a surprise inspection in the
			middle of a maintenance cycle!
			I tried to explain to him, but...
			He wouldn't listen.
			We're all going to be doing double
			shifts to get things ready for
			the next inspection.
			His style of command is just
			different. Klingons believe in
			a strict formality of command and
			obedience.
			But this isn't a Klingon ship.
			He's got to loosen up a little,
			Commander.
			It's not just us. He's leaning
			pretty hard on everybody except...
			Except the one guy who wouldn't
			mind it...
			Sensors picking up asteroidal
			debris ahead, Commander.
			Can you identify the coordinates,
			Mister Worf?
			Bearing zero-zero-one, mark
			point-oh-three, range three
			hundred thousand kilometers.
			Excellent. Please scan the
			asteroid field for me, Lieutenant,
			and report.
			Approximately two thousand small
			objects, none in our direct flight
			path, sir.
			So, no course correction is
			necessary, is that what you're
			saying?
			It should not be needed,
			Commander.
			Very good, Lieutenant. You
			handled that well.
			Yes?
			Commander.
			Captain's mess... ?
			Yes.
			Resume.
			Your knowledge of our systems and
			procedures is very impressive...
			...Sir.
			I would like to make one
			suggestion, sir.
			A suggestion...
			When I served aboard the Pagh,
			the hardest part for me was in
			recognizing and adapting to the
			demands of the crew. They needed
			an iron hand. They wanted it.
			I can imagine how difficult it
			must be for you to work with a
			crew that is so different. I'd
			be happy to guide you in this
			regard if it would be helpful.
			No. It wouldn't.
			This is not a Klingon ship, sir.
			No, Commander, it is not. If it
			were a Klingon ship, I would have
			killed you for offering your...
			"suggestion".
			How long has the bird been dead?
			It appears to have been lying in
			the sun for some time.
			It's not really dead, it's
			replicated. But you do understand
			we... cook many of our foods...
			Ah yes... I was told to prepare
			for that... I will try some of
			your burned replicated bird meat.
			I have attempted to select a menu
			that will allow you to sample a
			variety of dishes, Commander.
			Try some caviar...
			The odor is not palatable. What
			is it?
			The unhatched eggs of a large
			scaleless fish.
			It is from the Caspian Sea on
			Earth, Commander. A delicacy and
			a personal favorite of mine. Our
			replicators have never done it
			justice. I managed to store a
			few cases aboard for special
			occasions...
			I am honored, Captain.
			Are you adjusting to your new
			environment, Commander?
			I find the constraints quite
			difficult to conform to... I'm
			sure any Klingon warrior would...
			... just a short time ago, I had
			to stop myself from killing
			Commander Riker.
			I believe he was trying to
			communicate the crew's discomfort
			with my style of command...
			under different circumstances,
			I would take that as a challenge
			to my authority.
			One of the goals of the exchange
			program is for all of us to learn
			tolerance, Commander. As for my
			crew, it may be healthy to shake up
			the status quo occasionally. Feel
			free to disagree, Mister Riker...
			Well, I'd say the commander
			certainly has the crew on their
			toes...
			... And then some.
			No offense meant, sir...
			None taken. I never kill anyone
			at the supper table, Mister La
			Forge.
			Don't you like it, Commander?
			Our food has much more... taste
			to it. While I'm sure this is...
			well prepared, it is far too bland
			for the stomach of a Klingon...
			It seems to agree with Worf.
			Yes.
			Enter.
			'el (Enter.)
			Permission to speak freely, sir?
			For what purpose?
			I have questions I wish to pose.
			Are your quarters so...
			comfortable?
			They serve me.
			This entire ship seems built
			for... comfort, relaxation, being
			at ease. It is not the ship for
			a warrior... not the ship for a
			Klingon.
			You cannot ask these questions
			within the boundaries of protocol?
			They are... of a personal nature,
			sir.
			Permission granted. Pose your
			questions.
			I wish to know if I have given
			you offense.
			I am not a human... if you had
			given offense, you would not need
			to ask.
			Perhaps I have not performed my
			duties to your satisfaction?
			I find you to be a capable
			Starfleet officer. A credit to
			your ship.
			Yet you dishonor me at every
			opportunity.
			Have I? I was not aware that
			being polite to a Starfleet
			officer would bring dishonor on
			him.
			I am a Klingon.
			Really?
			Perhaps your blood has thinned
			in this environment. I simply
			don't want to... hurt you.
			mev yap! (That is enough!)
			So... your blood is not so thin
			after all.
			I am Klingon... if you doubt it,
			a demonstration can be arranged.
			That is the response of a Klingon.
			The response I would expect...
			from my... older brother.
			I was barely a year old when you
			went to the Khitomer Outpost.
			The outpost was new... unfinished.
			You... our mother and father were
			not going to stay long. It was
			decided that I did not need to
			go. I was left with our father's
			friend, Lorgh, until you returned.
			You never did.
			The Starfleet officer that rescued
			me was told by the Klingon High
			Command that I had no living
			relatives.
			They assumed I was killed with
			the family at Khitomer.
			Lorgh had no sons. He took me
			into his family. It was not until
			I had reached the Age of Ascension
			that I was told the truth.
			So you asked to serve aboard the
			Enterprise... to watch me.
			It was an excellent opportunity
			to find out what kind of Klingon
			you were... or if you were
			Klingon at all.
			Your deception offends me,
			brother.
			It should. But it was required.
			To satisfy your curiosity.
			No. Much more. You are the
			eldest son. The challenge is
			yours to make.
			Challenge... ?
			The Klingon High Council has
			judged our father a traitor to
			the empire.
			What are the allegations, Worf?
			My father is accused of aiding
			and abetting the Romulan attack
			on the Khitomer outpost.
			The attack in which he himself
			was killed... ?
			It is a lie.
			But why now... after twenty years?
			I do not know, Captain. I will
			hear the evidence when I arrive.
			The charge has been made by Duras,
			the son of my father's greatest
			rival.
			Our family name will be disgraced
			for seven generations. It is my
			responsibility to clear his name
			or answer for his crimes.
			Answer for them?
			The family of a Klingon warrior
			is responsible for his actions
			and he is responsible for theirs.
			If I fail in my challenge, I will
			be executed.
			Will you grant my leave, Captain?
			No.
			If I understand correctly, a
			Starfleet officer, a respected
			member of my crew could stand
			accused of a capital crime. Your
			actions in this matter reflect
			on this ship and the Federation.
			Therefore, it seems only
			appropriate for your captain to
			be at your side as you make your
			challenge, Lieutenant. I'm sure
			you would do no less for me.
			Commander Kurn...
			Sir.
			We are changing course. Set
			coordinates for the First City
			of the Klingon Imperial Empire.
			Mister Crusher...
			Sir!
			Lay in a course for the Klingon
			System. Bearing one-four-five
			by two-four-oh...
			Ready sir!
			Execute.
			We arrive within the hour.
			Yes.
			The Council will receive you at
			high sun in the Great Hall of--
			I know the procedures of the
			challenge.
			You'll need a cha'DIch to defend
			you. While you are accused, you
			will not be allowed combat.
			I would be honored if you chose
			me.
			I ask you to stand with me...
			to be my cha'DIch.
			jIlajneS. ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.
			(I accept. May your enemies run
			with fear.) The two sons of Mogh
			-- together, we shall restore the
			family honor.
			No. For the proceeding, you will
			not reveal your true father.
			I must...
			You will not.
			Because it would mean my death
			as well if you fail. A Klingon's
			honor means more than his life.
			Perhaps your human values cloud
			your judgment. I insist...
			On this ship, you are my
			commander. And I obey. In the
			council chamber, you are my
			cha'DIch. You do not insist.
			You obey.
			Yes, brother.
			There was a time... when just
			standing here would have been a
			death sentence for us.
			Captain, I am honored that you...
			Commander Riker... Counselor
			Troi... have chosen to accompany
			me. Your presence will surely
			impress the council.
			We're here as long as you need
			us, Worf.
			Once I make the challenge, I
			assume the sins of my father.
			I will be in disgrace until his
			innocence is proven. I would
			request that you not remain for
			the entire proceeding.
			You will never be a disgrace to
			us, Worf.
			It is a matter of personal honor
			to my brother.
			I understand.
			You will advise us when it is
			appropriate to depart.
			It will be clear.
			I am Worf, son of Mogh. I have
			come to challenge the lies that
			have been spoken of my father.
			Worf, son of Mogh, you have
			challenged the judgment of the
			council. Are you prepared to
			answer for this if you fail?
			With my life, K'mpec.
			Why do you come before us,
			Commander?
			I am Kurn, son of... Lorgh. I
			will stand by Worf's side. I am
			cha'DIch.
			You claim a birthright you have
			forsaken.
			I have not forsaken my heritage.
			I am Klingon. My heart is of this
			world... my blood is as yours.
			Yet you come to us wearing a
			child's uniform...
			And you bring outsiders to our
			hall.
			I am here at my own request.
			I am Captain Picard of the
			Enterprise. I extend greetings
			on behalf of the Federation.
			Your words have no meaning here.
			Lieutenant Worf has served under
			my command with distinction. He
			has earned my admiration and my
			respect. It is my greatest wish
			that this council in its wisdom
			will clear his family name and
			return him to duty.
			The trust of a commanding officer
			is admirable... the council has
			noted it.
			Speak the accusation.
			For many turns, the truth about
			Khitomer has lain dormant...
			unknown. Now the truth is
			revealed. The traitor, Mogh, sent
			the defense access code to the
			Romulan patrol ships and allowed
			them to destroy the outpost.
			Thousands died on Khitomer... my
			father died on Khitomer. Their
			deaths must be avenged!
			Your father was a traitor! By
			posing this challenge, you are
			a traitor!
			You will not wear the emblems of
			our people!
			Picard to Enterprise. Three to
			beam up.
			Mister Data... I want you to find
			out everything you can about the
			destruction of the Khitomer
			outpost. Cross reference with
			Romulan tactics and strategic
			information on the region.
			Request access to the Klingon
			central information net.
			Computer. Presentation overview
			of Klingon custom and law
			pertaining to familial
			accountability.
			Acknowledged.
			In my Ready Room.
			You are a fool. Your challenge
			will only result in a fool's
			death.
			It is a good day to die, Duras...
			and the day is not yet over.
			The council stands in recess.
			We will return for the mek'ba,
			when the evidence will be
			presented. Qapla' (Success! --
			a traditional Klingon parting)
			I would speak with you alone.
			You should not have brought the
			challenge... there was no risk
			to you... what does it matter... ?
			I am Klingon...
			Of that I have no question. But
			your life in the Federation would
			not be affected by this judgment.
			My father...
			Is dead. He died long ago.
			I knew your father, served with
			him... this is not the way I
			wanted to remember him. But we
			must let the past be and protect
			what we have now.
			If you leave before the mek'ba...
			no shame will fall on you. Return
			to your ship... go back to your
			life. The challenge will be
			forgotten.
			Why would you ask me to lay aside
			the honor of my father... my
			family... Are these the words
			of the council... ?
			I will not be questioned by you!
			Leave now or you too will be
			condemned as a traitor.
			The Klingon council is refusing
			to allow us access to their
			information net, Commander.
			On what basis?
			Orders of a member of the council.
			Duras...
			What Federation starship was
			closest to Khitomer at the time
			of the attack?
			The USS Intrepid, sir. They
			were the first ship on the scene.
			Contact Starfleet, request all logs
			of the Intrepid...
			Riker to Doctor Crusher.
			Crusher here...
			Doctor, I want you to look over
			the medical records of all rescue
			vessels that responded to the
			Khitomer massacre... see if there
			is any information on the aftermath
			that could help us.
			Understood.
			Uh, Commander, could I see you
			a moment...
			I was just making a few routine
			entries... and somehow, by
			accident, I just happened to...
			access the Klingon information
			net.
			How could you obtain access
			without the proper authorization
			codes?
			I don't think we want to know,
			Data.
			I should have known... come then
			Duras. Worf was right... it is
			a good day to die.
			That time has not yet come.
			It does not have to come for many
			turns. I know who you are,
			Kurn... son of Mogh.
			What?
			A strange decision to serve as
			his cha'DIch. I was curious to
			know why. Nothing can be hidden
			from me, Kurn.
			It was a wise choice to hide your
			family name -- do not err by
			embracing it again... for you only
			embrace death.
			We will see.
			Worf has made his choice and he
			will die for it. But you are
			still safe. Let him stand alone.
			He is no longer your brother...
			he is not one of us. I promise
			you no one will learn of your
			family line. You'll have your
			rank... maybe even a command of
			your own.
			He is my brother. I will not
			betray him!
			Then you will die for him.
			What kind of vicious weapon makes
			a wound like that... ?
			A kut'luch... the ceremonial
			weapon of an assassin.
			Fortunately, his metabolic
			recovery is phenomenal... he'll
			be all right...
			It does not matter. We should
			have let him die.
			Now that Duras knows his
			bloodline, we will both be
			executed.
			You sound like you've already
			lost, Worf.
			Commander, I have discovered the
			basis of the charges against
			Worf's father.
			Apparently the Klingons recently
			captured a Romulan ship with logs
			that provided new information on
			the Khitomer attack. They clearly
			indicate a transmission from the
			outpost to the Romulans moments
			before the shields dropped.
			From Worf's father?
			It does correspond to Mogh's
			personal security code.
			How can we be sure these records
			haven't been falsified?
			We can cross check them against
			the Intrepid's sensor logs...
			I will try... but the Intrepid
			was at the edge of sensor range
			during the attack and we cannot
			be sure if the scans are complete.
			Looks like a pretty good match-up,
			Data...
			Both the Intrepid and Romulan
			logs show a series of distress
			signals from Khitomer...
			What happens here...
			Gaps in the Intrepid logs, missing
			information because of the
			range...
			This is where Mogh's alleged
			transmission should be.
			Right in the middle of a gap.
			Wait a second, Data. Back up.
			Look at this... just before the
			Intrepid gap begins, the timebase
			of both files are in perfect
			sync... but look at the signals
			just after the shields dropped.
			They are no longer synchronous.
			Commander, somebody's been
			rewriting history.
			I will not pretend to fully
			understand the nuances of your
			world's law or culture, Mister
			Worf. But I do understand when
			somebody is trying to hide
			something...
			K'mpec urged me to drop my
			challenge, abandon my family
			honor... it was impossible to
			believe I was hearing a Klingon
			speak...
			Obviously, they did not expect
			and never wanted this challenge...
			you're getting close to something,
			Lieutenant... something they care
			a great deal about protecting...
			If it is true, it is not just
			Duras but the High Council itself
			that is my enemy.
			Captain, I must choose a new
			cha'DIch. I would like your
			permission to ask a member of the
			crew.
			Of course, Lieutenant. Ask
			whomever you wish.
			Sir, I would ask that you stand
			with me.
			You may refuse... with no
			dishonor.
			I appreciate the gesture,
			Lieutenant. But I know there are
			stronger, younger men from which
			to choose...
			A Klingon warrior knows that brute
			strength is not the most important
			asset in a fight. I have served
			under you in many conflicts...
			and know you to be a shrewd and
			forceful opponent. I can think
			of no one I would rather have at
			my side.
			jIlajneS. ghIj qet jaghmeyjaj.
			I accept.
			My challenge will proceed. No
			threat, no treachery will stop
			it.
			Not even a trap for my cha'DIch
			set by a coward.
			Duras...
			I will not listen to this filth
			from the son of a traitor...
			Keep your place, Picard!
			This is my place.
			He is now my cha'DIch.
			No! This cannot be allowed.
			This is not your world, human.
			You do not command here.
			I am not here to command.
			Then you must be ready to fight...
			something that Starfleet doesn't
			teach you.
			You may test that assumption...
			at your convenience.
			The cha'DIch is accepted.
			No!
			You challenge my authority?
			Mek'ba will begin.
			I've got something...
			Worf was not the only survivor
			of the Khitomer massacre.
			Another child?
			No. A Klingon woman was found
			with Worf.
			Kahlest... who was she?
			I don't know. Just says here she
			had severe injuries...
			transferred to Starbase twenty-four
			for treatment. That's when
			she was separated from Worf.
			After she recovered, she returned
			home.
			We've got to find her if she's
			still alive. Data, scan the
			Klingon central net... see if
			there's any record of her...
			... The Romulans lowered the
			outpost shields themselves. They
			were given the defense access
			code! The records clearly show
			the Romulan patrol ships receiving
			a personal transmission from Mogh
			just before they lowered the
			outpost shields. Mogh betrayed
			us. Four thousand Klingons died
			on Khitomer... and only the son
			of Mogh survived.
			Riker to Captain Picard.
			Stand by.
			The Khitomer commander noted in
			his log that Mogh had been acting
			suspiciously... that he was often
			away from his post for long
			periods of time. The commander
			found that Mogh was sending coded
			neutrino pulses to a sector within
			Romulan territory. A formal charge
			would have been made, but Mogh
			betrayed them and thousands were
			killed.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			We've located another survivor
			of the Khitomer massacre,
			Captain... a woman who was found
			with Worf. Her name is Kahlest...
			she resides in the Old Quarter
			of the First City.
			Well done. Picard out.
			... another witness has testified
			that Mogh often spoke of his
			admiration for the Romulans...
			Their culture... their women.
			K'mpec.
			May we have a... short recess?
			Len'mat. (recess)
			Have you heard of a woman named
			Kahlest?
			She was my ghojmoK... my nurse.
			Then it's possible she was an
			eyewitness to your father's
			activities at Khitomer...
			But she died in the attack---
			She survived. She's living in
			the Old Quarter. I'm going to
			find her.
			It is too dangerous. You cannot
			go alone.
			I am your cha'DIch.
			Kahlest?
			What do you want?
			Your help.
			No.
			You don't even know what I want.
			You are cha'Dich. I know.
			Then you know that Worf's life
			is at stake.
			I cannot help. I am dead.
			A long time dead.
			Were you with Worf's father just
			before the attack on Khitomer?
			I am dead!
			My... life ended on Khitomer.
			I served a proud family... a
			strong house. All that is gone.
			Worf is not gone, Kahlest. The
			family you served needs you again.
			I cannot help.
			Was his father a traitor?
			No!
			Mogh was loyal... to the emperor.
			Mogh suspected someone of plotting
			with the Romulans and followed
			them to Khitomer.
			Who? Who was the traitor?
			I do not know.
			We know a signal was sent to the
			Romulans just before the attack...
			if you were with Mogh and his
			family...
			I was not. I was with Worf only.
			Then, there is no way to prove
			Mogh's innocence, and Worf will
			die as the son of a traitor.
			You must leave, cha'DIch. I am
			dead.
			My appreciation, madam.
			You are brave, cha'DIch. Worf
			chose well. Lessons hold.
			Kahlest, would they know who you
			are? Would they recognize you?
			K'mpec would remember Kahlest.
			I caught his eye back then. I
			had many suitors once. He wanted
			seloh (sex) with me. He was too
			fat.
			Then, come back with me. They
			do not know how much you know.
			Perhaps it will shake loose the
			truth.
			I will come.
			The mek'ba is complete. The
			evidence is clear. I ask that the
			judgment stand... and that Worf be
			condemned as the son of a traitor
			to the Empire.
			Worf, son of Mogh...
			tam (Be quiet!)
			The mek'ba is not complete. I
			bring an eyewitness to the
			Khitomer massacre... with new
			evidence, K'mpec.
			Mogh was innocent.
			Len'mat.
			What is it you think you know,
			old woman?
			Do not answer.
			Rules of the mek'ba require that
			her evidence be presented in open
			council.
			You will die before giving
			evidence.
			You stand there while this patahk
			threatens an old woman?
			Be silent, Duras. Would you kill
			old women to cover your dishonor?
			Yes, Duras, it is your dishonor
			we are protecting here, isn't it?
			I have no reluctance to kill you,
			human.
			Are you prepared to hear her
			evidence in open council, Duras?
			Obviously, we are not. Kahlest,
			you will go now.
			It is good to see you again.
			You are still fat, K'mpec.
			I asked you to leave, to let this
			judgment go unanswered... but
			you did not hear my words, and
			now it has come to this.
			Why did you judge my father guilty
			when you knew he was not?
			Someone had to be blamed. The
			warriors who captured the Romulan
			ship had learned of the treachery.
			But only the council knew whose
			security code had been
			transmitted. Ja'rod, father of
			Duras.
			This Ha'DIbaH (animal) should have
			been fed to the dogs!
			His family is powerful. If the
			truth were known, it would shatter
			the council... almost certainly
			plunge us into civil war.
			You were in Starfleet... we did
			not expect you to challenge the
			judgment. Nor did we know that
			there was another son of Mogh.
			Worf's challenge is successful.
			His family honor must be restored,
			K'mpec.
			You don't understand. His
			challenge was defeated before he
			ever made it. You will not be
			allowed to present this evidence.
			The judgment will stand and you
			will be condemned... as will your
			brother.
			You admit the truth and still
			expect him to accept punishment.
			What does this say of an empire
			that holds honor so dear?
			The empire will not be destroyed
			for one family's honor.
			This is unacceptable, K'mpec.
			You have no say in this, cha'DIch!
			I speak now as the captain of
			the USS Enterprise and
			Lieutenant Worf's commanding
			officer. You will not execute
			a member of my crew, sir. Nor
			will I turn his brother over to
			you.
			You risk much. This is not the
			Federation, Picard. If you defy
			the orders of the High Council
			in an affair of the empire, the
			alliance with the Federation
			could fall to dust.
			The alliance with the Federation
			is not based on lies! Protect
			your secrets if you must, but do
			not sacrifice these men.
			A true Klingon will not run from
			his judgment, Captain. No matter
			what you would have them do.
			What will you do with Kurn? Make
			him a Starfleet officer? He is
			a Klingon. When his tour aboard
			your ship is complete he will have
			no place to go. He would rather
			die.
			I will die for the empire.
			Lieutenant...
			The cha'DIch will be silent.
			Allow my brother to return to his
			life. Only you need know his
			true bloodline.
			Not acceptable. His honor would
			demand revenge. He is too
			dangerous.
			If you allow him to live, I will
			give you something that will
			serve your purpose far more than
			my death. I will accept...
			discommendation.
			You would do this in open council?
			It would be the same as admitting
			your father's guilt, Worf.
			So be it.
			Your heart is Klingon. It will
			be done.
			What has been said here will never
			be spoken of again.
			You... are the son of a traitor.
			I am ready.
			Enough! I will stand alone in
			the hall.
			Why is he doing this? I was ready
			to die.
			Worf wants you to live... the name
			of your father must someday be
			cleared. He needs you alive...
			with your honor intact.
			But to do this...
			There will be another day,
			Commander. Do not forget what
			he does here today... do not let
			your children forget.
			tlhIH ghIj jIHyoj. (I fear your
			judgment)
			biHnuch (Coward)
			You must also...
			May you stand here again someday
			and roar over the fallen bodies
			of your enemies.
			We will stand together...
			...brother.
