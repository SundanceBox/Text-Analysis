			Captain's log, Stardate 43125.2.
			We are en route to Mintaka Three,
			where a three-man Federation
			anthropological field team has
			been studying the inhabitants.
			Our mission is to resupply the
			outpost and repair their
			malfunctioning reactor.
			Report, Mister La Forge.
			We've finished replicating the
			parts they need.
			What I don't understand is why
			a three-man station needs a
			reactor that can produce
			four-point-two gigawatts.
			That's enough to power a small
			phaser bank, a subspace relay
			station, or...
			... a hologram generator. Right
			-- a "duck blind."
			The anthropologists are studying
			an extended family of Mintakans
			at close range... from a
			camouflaged observation post.
			According to Doctor Barron's
			preliminary reports, the Mintakans
			are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the
			Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful
			and highly rational.
			Not surprising, considering how
			closely their evolution has
			paralleled Vulcan.
			Captain, incoming transmission
			from Mintaka Three.
			On screen.
			Barron to Enterprise. Our
			temporary repairs have failed.
			The reactor is now inoperative.
			Do you have battery backup?
			Three hours' worth at best.
			Captain, if we increase to warp
			seven we can be there in twenty-three
			minutes.
			Make it so.
			We're on our way --
			We've lost contact, sir.
			Increase to warp nine.
			Why did we have to come so early?
			When the sun reaches its zenith,
			I have to be ready to take the
			measurements.
			You'll be ready. You've read
			the sundial hundreds of times.
			Yes, father -- but never as the
			appointed recordkeeper.
			You're taking your duties quite
			seriously. Your mother would have
			been proud of you.
			What is that?
			I don't know...
			Keep work... Palmer... Warren...
			The hologram generator is now
			functional.
			Or would be, if we had power...
			Almost there...
			Enterprise -- beam Martinez and
			his patient directly to Sickbay.
			Doctor --
			Crusher to Enterprise. Medical
			emergency. Two to beam directly
			to Sickbay.
			That should do it.
			Before you start quoting the Prime
			Directive -- he'd already seen
			us; the damage was done. It was
			bring him aboard or let him die.
			Then why didn't you let him die?
			Because we were responsible for
			his injuries!
			I don't know if I concur with
			that reasoning, Doctor. But now
			that he's here, you must remove
			all memory of his encounter with
			the away team.
			By erasing short-term recall?
			It's been accomplished before.
			Yes, I'm familiar with Doctor
			Pulaski's technique.
			Though I can't guarantee it will
			be effective on Mintakan brain
			chemistry --
			No! We must evacuate --
			Doctor Barron! You're on the
			Enterprise. You're safe now.
			The others?
			Doctor Warren is here. We're
			doing all we can.
			And Palmer? Where is Palmer?
			Still on Mintaka Three.
			Picard -- you have to find him.
			We will.
			He may be hurt --
			Rest assured -- we will not leave
			until we locate Palmer.
			Thank you, Picard.
			Picard to bridge. Report.
			Scans of the planet detect no
			humans, Captain.
			Very well. Take us into a close
			orbit.
			Sir, a close orbit will
			increase sensor efficiency by
			only four percent.
			I want that four percent,
			Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			Picard out.
			Picard?
			Damn --
			Doctor, your next task is clear.
			Oji?
			Father?
			Here...
			I thought I'd never see you again.
			When you and the woman vanished,
			I was sure you were dead.
			I think I was... but I was brought
			back to life. I awoke in an
			incredible place -- and my wounds
			were gone. I had been healed.
			How is that possible?
			Long ago, our people believed in
			beings with great powers. These
			beings made the rains come, told
			the sun when to rise, and caused
			all life to be born, to grow,
			to die.
			But those are just tales -- old
			superstitions.
			Perhaps the beliefs of our
			ancestors are true. Nothing else
			can explain what's happened.
			Everything's changed now, Oji.
			We must tell the others...
			... Barron is stable, but Warren
			is still critical.
			Palmer is missing, and scans of
			the planet pick up Mintakan life
			forms only -- no humans.
			However...
			The area around the duck blind
			exhibits Karst topography --
			sinkholes, underground rivers,
			and caverns. And the rock strata
			contain a high concentration of
			thallium compounds, which may be
			obstructing our sensor beams.
			So if Palmer, in his delirium,
			fled into a cave, we might be
			unable to detect his life signs.
			Correct.
			Captain, if he is still alive,
			he probably needs medical
			attention. We must send an away
			team to locate him.
			But our presence mustn't interfere
			with the cultural development of
			the Mintakans.
			Agreed. Further contamination
			must be prevented.
			Sir, I have a suggestion.
			First officer's log, Stardate
			43125.3. Counselor Troi and I
			are beaming down to Mintaka Three
			to locate Doctor Palmer and
			determine the extent of the
			cultural contamination.
			Doctor Crusher has temporarily
			altered our features and skin
			color. She's also implanted
			subcutaneous communicators so that
			any transmissions we receive will
			be inaudible to the Mintakans.
			Riker to Enterprise -- do you
			read?
			Perfectly, Commander. I will be
			monitoring you continuously.
			Mintakan emotions are quite
			interesting. Like the Vulcans,
			they have highly ordered minds...
			A very sensible people.
			For example, Mintakan women
			precede their mates. It's a
			signal to other women.
			"This man's taken; get your own?"
			Not precisely... More like, "if
			you want his services, I'm the
			one to negotiate with."
			What kinds of "services?"
			All kinds.
			Ah. They are a sensible race.
			I understand your skepticism.
			Had it not happened to me, I would
			find it difficult to accept as
			well.
			But it did happen, just as we've
			told you.
			Fento -- you know the legends
			better than anyone. Don't they
			speak of beings like the ones I've
			seen --
			-- who could vanish like smoke?
			There are the stories of the
			Overseer... who could appear and
			disappear at will...
			And couldn't this Overseer heal
			the dead?
			He had supreme power -- or so our
			ancestors believed.
			I believe I've seen the
			Overseer...
			Uh-oh...
			He is called the Picard.
			His memory is intact.
			The procedure didn't work.
			Liko -- all this talk of a
			supernatural being... No one's
			believed that for countless
			generations. Just as we no longer
			believe the stars control our
			fates, or that the spirits of the
			dead haunt the living.
			I'm not saying all the old beliefs
			are true. But I did see the
			Picard, and I was restored to
			life.
			We are visitors; we've come to
			trade our cloth. May we speak?
			Please do -- we welcome outsiders.
			I am Nuria.
			I am Troi; this is Riker.
			You've had a very interesting
			dream.
			Dream? It was real!
			My father and I both witnessed
			these beings.
			If you are father and daughter,
			you may have shared the same
			dream.
			That is not reasonable.
			Is it any less reasonable than
			being magically propelled to a
			strange place by "the Picard?"
			Nuria!
			It has to be -- Palmer -- the one
			the Picard wished to find.
			Remarkable. You were speaking
			the truth.
			The Picard will be pleased.
			Riker to Picard.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			We have a problem.
			The contamination?
			It's worse than we suspected.
			The Mintakans are beginning to
			believe in a god -- and the one
			they've chosen... is you.
			Picard -- you must beam Palmer
			aboard immediately. Without
			medical attention --
			It's not that simple. He's
			surrounded by Mintakans. If he
			dematerializes before their
			eyes...
			... it will slightly increase the
			cultural contamination which
			already exists. A small price
			for saving Palmer's life.
			Number One -- is there any chance
			of your freeing Palmer and
			transporting up unseen?
			We can try...
			Try hard. Picard out.
			Picard, I must protest. You're
			endangering Palmer with this
			delay.
			I'm aware of that. But each of
			us -- including Doctor Palmer --
			took an oath to uphold the Prime
			Directive... if necessary, with
			our lives.
			We followed a hornbuck into a
			cave. The stranger was there --
			asleep.
			This Palmer is one of the
			Overseer's servants?
			Yes -- the Picard has many
			servants.
			Isn't that true?
			According to the legends. But
			if Palmer is a servant of the
			Overseer, what was he doing in
			the cave?
			Perhaps he ran away.
			Or he failed the Picard somehow
			and was hiding from him.
			We should bind him in case he
			wakes and tries to escape.
			It's senseless to hold this
			stranger captive. This Overseer
			talk is nothing more than an old
			superstition.
			I disagree. All the evidence
			suggests the Overseer does exist.
			And I heard the Picard say he
			wanted to find Palmer.
			Then by keeping Palmer safe, we
			will please the Picard.
			And he'll grant us favors in return.
			Favors?
			The Overseer was said to be
			all-powerful. He could provide
			gentle winters, plentiful hunting,
			fertile crops... anything.
			He could even bring back those
			who have died.
			We will keep Palmer for the
			Picard.
			I've seen another one -- like
			Palmer!
			Another servant of the Picard?
			He's headed toward the caves!
			Fento -- stay and bind Palmer.
			Excuse me... that knot won't hold.
			If I may assist...
			Please do.
			The trick is to make a knot that
			tightens under pressure. Here,
			I'll show you...
			Father -- the sun's reaching its
			zenith. If I don't go to measure...
			Go.
			Forgive me, friend... but the
			stranger must be set free.
			Riker to Enterprise. Lock on and
			prepare to beam us directly to
			Sickbay, but wait for my signal.
			Acknowledged, Commander.
			Riker?
			Riker! Stop!
			Oji?
			It's Riker -- he's taking Palmer!
			Yari -- don't let her escape.
			I'm clear. Energize!
			Data. Has Counselor Troi beamed
			up?
			Negative, Commander. Sensors show
			she's in the midst of a group of
			Mintakans.
			Damn.
			Hali -- find Riker and Palmer.
			Why? Why did you and Riker take
			Palmer from us?
			We did not "take" Palmer...
			... we set him free. Riker and
			I don't believe these fables about
			the Overseer.
			Don't you realize what you've
			done?
			You've angered the Picard -- and
			we may all suffer for it!
			Weren't there stories of the
			Overseer destroying those who
			offended him?
			Stories. Nothing more.
			Liko, we'll get Palmer back.
			Riker was carrying him -- they
			can't have gone far.
			Still, the Picard may blame us
			for Palmer's escape.
			Perhaps we should punish her --
			to let the Overseer know that she
			and Riker acted alone.
			We'll keep Troi captive.
			That's not enough.
			You would have us harm her?
			If it will hold off the Picard's
			anger -- yes. I've seen how
			powerful he is...
			I am unwilling to hurt Troi
			needlessly.
			We will wait for Hali and the
			others to return.
			And if they don't find Palmer?
			Then we may have to do as Liko
			suggests.
			You believe the Mintakans are
			capable of harming Troi?
			They are not normally a violent
			people... but these are
			extraordinary circumstances.
			They're trying to comprehend what
			they believe to be a god.
			Recommendations?
			The Mintakans wish to please the
			Overseer, but they can only guess
			what he wants. They need a sign.
			Are you suggesting...
			You must go down to Mintaka Three.
			Masquerading as a god?
			Out of the question. The Prime
			Directive --
			Has already been violated. The
			damage is done; all we can do now
			is minimize it.
			By sanctioning their false
			beliefs?
			By giving them guidelines...
			letting them know what the
			Overseer expects of them.
			I cannot -- I will not impose a
			set of commandments on these
			people. To do so violates the
			essence of the Prime Directive.
			Like it or not, we've rekindled
			the Mintakans' belief in the
			Overseer.
			And you're saying that belief will
			eventually develop into a
			religion.
			It's inevitable. And without
			guidance, that religion could
			degenerate into inquisitions...
			holy wars... chaos.
			Your own reports describe how
			rational these people are.
			Millennia ago, they abandoned all
			belief in the supernatural. And
			now you're asking me to sabotage
			that achievement... send them
			back into the Dark Ages of fear
			and superstition.
			No. We must undo the damage we've
			caused.
			Number One -- tell me about the
			group's leader.
			Nuria is exceptionally fair-minded
			and sensible... the Mintakans
			trust her judgment. If we could
			convince her we're not gods...
			... she might be able to persuade
			the others.
			And how do you propose to convince
			her?
			She sees the Picard as a magical
			figure. I'm going to show her
			how the magic works.
			Bring her aboard.
			Counselor, sensors indicate five
			Mintakans in your immediate
			vicinity.
			Four are motionless; the fifth
			is eight meters away, proceeding
			south. Is Nuria one of these
			five?
			Mmm-hmm.
			Was that intended to be an
			affirmative?
			Yes, Data, it was.
			Is Nuria the closest of the five?
			Mmm-mmm.
			Negative.
			Is Nuria the one in motion?
			Mmm-hmm.
			Lock sensors on Nuria.
			Locked on, Commander. We can
			beam Nuria aboard at will.
			Data, when sensors indicate she's
			alone, beam her to Transporter
			Room One.
			Aye, sir.
			Ensign Hoy, I'll handle this.
			Nuria -- don't be afraid.
			No one's going to harm you.
			Who... ?
			My name is Jean-Luc Picard.
			Please -- get up.
			Get up! You don't kneel to me.
			You do not wish it?
			I do not deserve it.
			Look at me. Feel the warmth of
			my hand, the rhythm of my pulse.
			I am not a supreme being -- I am
			flesh and blood, like you.
			Not like me...
			Like you! Different in
			appearance, yes. But we are both
			living beings -- we are born, we
			grow, we live, we die. In all
			the ways that matter, we are
			alike.
			But -- you are the Picard!
			Let me show you my people.
			Let me show you something.
			What a wondrous place this is.
			Even the doors obey your commands.
			It is wondrous -- but not
			miraculous. The doors merely work
			differently from the ones you
			know.
			That is my home?
			Seen from far, far above.
			Yet we don't fall.
			I never imagined I would see the
			clouds... from the other side.
			Your powers are truly boundless.
			Nuria -- your people live in huts.
			Was it always so?
			No. We have found remnants of
			tools in caves. Our ancestors
			must have lived there.
			Why do you now live in huts?
			Huts are better. Caves are dark
			and wet --
			If huts are better, why did your
			people ever live in caves?
			The most reasonable explanation
			is that at one time we didn't know
			how to make huts.
			Just as there was a time when you
			didn't know how to make cloth --
			or bows.
			That is reasonable.
			Someone invented huts. Someone
			invented the bow. And they taught
			others, who taught their children,
			who taught their children's
			children...
			Now suppose one of your cave-dwelling
			ancestors could see you
			as you are today. What would she
			think?
			I don't know.
			Put yourself in her place. You
			have a power she lacks. You can
			kill a hornbuck from a great
			distance.
			Only because I have a bow.
			She has never seen a bow -- it
			doesn't yet exist in her world.
			To you, it's a simple tool. To
			her, it's magic.
			I suppose she might think so.
			And how would she react to you?
			I think... she would fear me.
			Just as you fear me.
			I do not fear you any longer.
			Good. My people once lived in
			caves, too. We learned to build
			huts... and, later, to build ships
			such as this one.
			Perhaps some day my people will
			travel above the sky...
			Of that, I have absolutely no
			doubt.
			It's not the season for lightning.
			It must be a warning...
			We've had storms at this time of
			year before.
			Not like this one...
			It must mean something!
			The Picard is angry with us. He
			blames us for Palmer's escape.
			Liko -- we don't know that the
			Overseer is responsible for this
			storm...
			Will he also send floods? My wife
			died in last year's floods -- will
			we all die now?
			We must find Nuria.
			Picard... you have shown me
			wonders I could never have
			imagined... and I am grateful
			beyond words... but might I
			request something for my people?
			You are indeed a leader.
			You have shown me such generosity;
			I wish my people could share in
			it.
			Six Mintakans died in a flood last
			winter. Four of them were
			children.
			Would you bring them back to life?
			That is beyond my power.
			Why? You restored Liko's life.
			Did the six who died offend you
			in some way?
			Or have I offended you? Should
			I have ordered the death of Troi?
			Please -- if there is anything
			I can do to change your mind...
			I've failed to get through to you,
			haven't I? Despite all my
			efforts...
			Nuria can't be found. No one
			knows where she's gone.
			Hali! Any sign of Palmer or
			Riker?
			They've escaped us. We searched
			everywhere.
			What do we do now?
			As the Picard wishes. Punish
			those responsible.
			Nuria would not allow --
			Nuria isn't here -- and we can't
			wait.
			Crusher to Picard. I think
			we're going to lose Warren.
			On my way.
			I'm here, Mary.
			Prepare two cc's of norep.
			I'm sorry.
			Picard?
			You could not save her.
			No.
			You do have limits. You are not
			masters of life and death.
			No, we are not.
			We can cure many diseases and
			repair many injuries. We can
			extend life... but despite all
			our knowledge -- all our advances
			-- we are just as mortal as you
			are... just as powerless to
			prevent the inevitable.
			You are a remarkable people. But
			you are not superior beings.
			My people must be made to
			understand that.
			Liko -- you don't want to kill
			me.
			I have no choice. I must do as
			the Picard wishes.
			Are you sure you know what he
			wants?
			That's one problem with believing
			in a supernatural being... trying
			to determine what he wants.
			We must do something.
			But what if we do the wrong thing?
			Picard. We need your guidance.
			Is it your wish that this woman
			should die?
			Answer us! Speak!
			Liko!
			The Picard! The Overseer has
			come!
			No, Liko -- I am not the Overseer.
			I am a man... a traveller from
			a faraway land. Nothing more.
			But you restored my life! I am
			your servant.
			You are no one's servant. I
			deserve neither your obedience
			nor your worship.
			Why are you trying to deceive me?
			Picard speaks the truth. I've
			visited his people... I've seen
			how they live... how they die.
			When death takes their loved ones,
			they are as helpless as we are.
			Then how was I brought back to
			life?
			You were not dead. Picard's
			people have knowledge we lack --
			they can heal wounds that we
			cannot.
			You can bring people back from
			the dead. Show them, Picard.
			You can bring my wife back to me.
			I can't.
			Why? Why won't you do this for
			me? Have I failed you somehow?
			Are you angry with me?
			I am not angry.
			Then I beg you -- bring her back
			to life!
			I will give you my life in
			exchange! Please -- take back
			what you've given me -- and give
			it to her! Let her live!
			It is beyond my power.
			Nothing is beyond your power!
			You are the Overseer -- I'll
			prove it!
			Liko!
			Go ahead, Liko. If I am
			all-powerful, you can't hurt me.
			If, however, I am telling the
			truth and I am mortal... you will
			kill me.
			But if the only proof you will
			believe is my life -- then shoot.
			Don't do it, Liko!
			Father -- no!
			Captain's log, supplemental.
			Before we dismantle the
			observation post and depart, I
			must make one last visit to
			Mintaka Three.
			Now, Mister La Forge.
			What is it?
			A place where we could watch your
			people.
			Why?
			To study you. To understand your
			ways.
			Why should a people so advanced
			want to learn about us?
			Because we were once as you are.
			To study you is to understand
			ourselves.
			But why did you have to hide from
			us?
			Because their presence would
			affect us... as it affected me.
			It is our highest law that we
			shall not interfere with other
			cultures.
			Then revealing yourselves was an
			accident.
			Yes. And now we must leave.
			Why? There's so much you could
			teach us...
			But that would also be
			interfering. You must progress
			on your own.
			As we will. You've shown us
			that nothing is beyond our reach.
			Not even the stars.
			I wish you good journeys, Picard.
			Remember my people.
			Always.
