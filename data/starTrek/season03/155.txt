			Marking beam-out position.
			Return transport: fourteen
			minutes, forty seconds.
			Your view any better, Geordi?
			Not too bad, sir. A lot of
			charged-particle precipitation,
			but I can compensate.
			Communicators are dysfunctional.
			Tricorders?
			Readings only valid within five
			meters.
			I'm not so sure of that... I'm
			reading Worf as an unintelligent
			life form.
			Good thing we didn't bring
			Data... we would've been
			unscrambling his circuits for a
			week...
			Picking up something on the
			positron scan, Commander.
			Over here. Some electrically
			conductive objects.
			Recognize the markings, Worf?
			Yessir. Romulan.
			I wonder what the hell they were
			doing in a Federation sector.
			I'm picking up traces of ultritium
			residue with my VISOR, Commander.
			An explosive device must've been
			used to destroy the craft after
			it crashed.
			Spread out... twenty five meter
			radius... our window back closes
			in nine minutes...
			Commander...
			Commander Riker...
			COMMANDER RIKER... WORF... HEY
			UP THERE...
			Four minutes to beam-up, sir.
			Where is he? Wait here...
			La Forge to Riker... La Forge to
			Worf...
			HEY...
			GEORDI...
			Lieutenant Worf, maintain your
			position.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43349.2.
			An unidentified distress signal
			has led to the discovery of a
			crashed Romulan vessel on the
			surface of Galorndon Core, a
			Federation planet.
			We have recovered one survivor.
			Lieutenant Commander La Forge
			did not report back with the away
			team and is still missing on the
			surface.
			Get him to Sickbay.
			Secure Sickbay. Post guards in
			visual contact at all times.
			He's not going anywhere,
			Lieutenant.
			I'm sorry, Commander... There's
			just no way to lock in on anything
			down there...
			Keep trying, Mister O'Brien.
			The electrical storms are creating
			thousands of ghosts...
			Then beam some of the ghosts up
			here... one of them may be La
			Forge.
			Request permission to lead another
			away team...
			Denied.
			When we get another window in the
			storms.
			The crash site?
			The Romulan craft's a total loss.
			There's nothing there to salvage
			-- unless we do it with tweezers.
			No sign of others...
			We could barely see two meters
			in front of us down there...
			It certainly is the last place
			one would expect a Romulan
			encroachment.
			On the other hand, Galorndon Core
			would provide ideal cover for an
			opening move of a new offensive.
			I doubt they were there for the
			climate.
			We thought it would be like
			working on a Vulcan, but there
			are subtle differences... too many
			of them...
			Can you treat him?
			He has cell damage in vital
			areas... He's going to need a
			transfusion of compatible
			ribosomes in order to recover.
			I'm setting up a schedule to
			test every member of the crew.
			Will he survive?
			I can't answer that yet.
			Let me put it another way -- will
			he survive long enough to tell
			us what he was doing here?
			It is an important consideration,
			Doctor.
			I can't put his life in any
			additional jeopardy...
			Nor would we ask you to.
			I can bring him around for a few
			minutes...
			There is one serious complication.
			His brainwaves indicate early
			neural-pathway degeneration.
			A head injury?
			There was no obvious cranial
			trauma. I'm guessing the exposure
			to the magnetic fields on the
			surface was slowly breaking down
			his synaptic connections.
			Will it affect Geordi the same
			way?
			You are aboard the Federation
			Starship Enterprise.
			We are treating your injuries.
			How long were you on Galorndon
			Core?
			Do you understand me?
			I will not answer questions.
			We must know if there are any
			other survivors on the surface.
			I am alone. I will not answer
			any questions.
			Is there a mother ship we should
			advise of your condition?
			The only answer he offers is that
			he was alone...
			... which suggests he wasn't.
			Something that can cut through
			the storm... to give us some way
			to signal him...
			A neutrino pulse...
			We could build a portable neutrino
			source and send it in a probe to
			the surface. It would be like
			a beacon.
			A neutrino pulse would send
			non-charged particles back up
			through the atmosphere... and
			would be detectable by Geordi's
			VISOR.
			He'll be able to show us that he's
			found it by modifying the
			pulse...
			Make it so.
			Captain, I have a new transmission
			on a parallel frequency to the
			distress call...
			From the planet?
			No sir... from inside the Romulan
			Zone. We should be able to view
			the transmission.
			On screen.
			Tomalak to Pi.
			We have received your distress
			signal. Respond.
			If you can hear me, we are
			entering the Neutral Zone now...
			We will reach you in six hours.
			Mister Worf, hail the Romulan
			vessel.
			Frequency open, sir.
			Romulan vessel. This is Captain
			Jean-Luc Picard of the Federation
			Starship Enterprise.
			The frequency is open, sir.
			Commander Tomalak, we have
			intercepted your transmission.
			You are not to enter Federation
			space.
			Captain Picard, my apologies.
			If I had known you were in this
			sector, I certainly would have
			advised you before crossing the
			Neutral Zone.
			Really...
			I'm sure you'll understand when
			I explain. Simply, one of our
			ships had a slight navigational
			error and apparently crashed on
			Galorndon Core.
			A "slight" navigational error.
			Nearly half a light year past the
			Neutral Zone.
			I assure you, Captain, no
			aggression was intended.
			Commander, we have recovered one
			of your survivors.
			He is on board your ship?
			We are treating him for severe
			injuries.
			And his craft?
			Destroyed... deliberately... after
			the crash.
			Standard procedure for all Romulan
			crews.
			For all Romulan crews in enemy
			space... which would suggest they
			knew where they were, Commander.
			If I were lost and uncertain, I
			would not take any chances. Nor
			I suspect would you, Captain.
			May I speak to him?
			He is not conscious... and not
			well enough to leave Sickbay.
			Captain, with your permission...
			I am Doctor Crusher, the medical
			officer. We are doing everything
			we can for him and it still may
			not be enough. Any medical
			guidance your ship's doctor can
			offer...
			My dear, there is no way to talk
			you through the intricacies of
			Romulan medicine. His life is in
			your hands.
			I assume that you are prepared
			to leave at once and rendezvous
			with me in the Neutral Zone.
			I have an away team on the
			surface. We are waiting for a
			window in the storm to beam them
			back.
			And then you will return my
			officer?
			Are there any other Romulans we
			should be looking to recover from
			Galorndon Core... ?
			No. It was a one-man craft.
			Captain, we will be at the
			Federation border of the Neutral
			Zone in roughly five hours. We
			will expect you to rendezvous at
			that time.
			Counselor?
			There is great hostility behind
			his smile, Captain. To complete
			his mission, he will stop at
			nothing.
			Including the Neutral Zone border?
			Sir, I see no reason to return
			the Romulan to his ship. He
			should be held and interrogated.
			We do have a right to detain him,
			Captain.
			Without clear evidence of intent,
			it would not be a simple matter.
			This was obviously not pilot's
			error, Captain... it requires a
			response from us.
			We must measure the response
			carefully, Number One. Or history
			may remember Galorndon Core
			alongside Pearl Harbor and Station
			Salem-One... as the stage for
			a bloody preamble to war.
			What the hell... ?
			About five degrees off... huh.
			The water maybe... ?
			I want him off all the drugs...
			they aren't doing anything...
			Doctor Crusher to Picard.
			Go ahead.
			My patient is not responding to
			treatment.
			You haven't found a compatible
			ribosome donor?
			The lab is still processing the
			tests... early results indicate
			humans have far too many
			biorejection factors. I've also
			ruled out the Vulcans we've
			tested.
			We'll try a little old-fashioned
			country medicine... keep the
			fever down, try to let the body
			heal itself...
			Keep me advised. Picard out.
			Captain, the neutrino beacon is
			operational. We've placed it
			aboard a class three probe.
			Well done, Ensign.
			Launch the probe.
			Probe has entered the atmosphere,
			sir.
			The neutrino stream is coming in
			strongly. Sensors are tracking
			the probe despite the
			interference.
			This better not be another
			malfunction...
			A stationary neutrino source...
			Wesley Crusher.
			You are my prisoner.
			Right. Congratulations.
			Certainly, a strategic triumph
			for the Romulan Empire.
			Stay there.
			My shoes are getting full of
			sand... I just hate that, don't
			you? You think we could just
			maybe move outta the...
			How many other Federation troops
			are with you?
			We just stopped by to rescue you,
			big fella... which I'm still
			willing to do if you'll put that
			down...
			Or we can just stand here and take
			in the view...
			Your name and rank.
			Lieutenant Commander Geordi La
			Forge. I don't believe I caught
			yours... ?
			A Romulan ship will arrive
			shortly... you will accompany me
			on board...
			Uh, I really don't think that's
			gonna happen, Ensign... or is it
			Commodore...
			Yeah, see... we heard your message
			too... and well, the fleet's in,
			Commodore. Sky's full of
			Federation ships.
			You're lying.
			I never lie when I've got sand
			in my shoes, Commodore.
			Get up.
			Seriously. There's only one way
			out of here. Put that down and
			I'll take you back to my ship as
			soon as there's a window in the
			storm...
			You gotta be kidding.
			Sit.
			Welcome to Galorndon Core, where
			no good deed goes unpunished...
			Yes, Doctor...
			Lieutenant. Good. Come in.
			Please, sit down...
			We've finally found a compatible
			ribosome match for the Romulan.
			But only one. You.
			That is impossible. I am a
			Klingon.
			Different species, yes. But
			Humans, Romulans, Vulcans,
			Klingons, Betazoids -- we're all
			genetically similar. We have
			comparable cell structures. And
			you have what this Romulan
			needs. There's absolutely no
			risk to you...
			You did understand that was the
			purpose of all the testing...
			I have no objection to tests.
			You have an objection to being
			a donor.
			Yes.
			Lieutenant, I understand your
			feelings about the Romulans.
			But this is not the time or
			place...
			If you had seen them kill your
			parents, you would understand,
			Doctor. It is always the time
			and place for those feelings.
			This Romulan did not kill your
			parents. And you are the only
			one who can save his life.
			Then he will die.
			I don't need him to like the idea,
			Captain... just to do it.
			There is no alternative?
			The alternative is the Romulan
			will die. Worf is quite correct
			on that point.
			We need him alive...
			It is easy to forget that our
			Lieutenant Worf is not human.
			His values are very different from
			yours and mine.
			Of course they are. But he is
			also an officer of Starfleet...
			and this is...
			... this is a personal matter...
			It's very personal, Captain.
			Especially to the Romulan who's
			dying in my Sickbay. Maybe he
			has a family waiting for him to
			come home.
			Worf is a good man. I know with
			a word of encouragement from you
			he will do the right thing.
			Order him.
			Encourage him.
			A captain's encouragement is
			difficult to refuse, Doctor.
			And difficult to offer to a man
			whose feelings run so deep.
			Even if it means the life of the
			Romulan?
			I must respect his personal
			views... even if I do not share
			them. He will have to live with
			the consequences of his decision.
			We will all have to.
			I wish you'd put that away.
			You're afraid of dying.
			You bet I am. Who isn't?
			I'm not.
			Right.
			To die in the service of my
			people...
			Ah, the Romulan path to glory.
			You can be sarcastic -- now. But
			in a few millennia, when humans
			are extinct and the Romulan Empire
			spans the galaxy...
			You really believe that stuff,
			don't you, Commodore?
			Our culture is far older and wiser
			than yours. It's inevitable that
			we will prevail.
			Well, if you're that sure of
			yourselves, why be so
			tight-lipped? You won't even tell
			me your name.
			I see no need to tell you.
			Why? Is it a military secret or
			something? I've told you mine.
			Okay, Commodore... whatever you
			say.
			You may address me as Centurion
			Bochra.
			Ahh. Bochra. Good, solid Romulan
			name. And you're a centurion.
			Well, stay with it, you'll be a
			commodore someday.
			I'm not certain of the equivalent
			Federation rank... but I do know
			it's higher than lieutenant
			commander.
			What's the matter?
			Nothing.
			Wrong. Your heart rate just shot
			way up.
			It translates a wide range of
			radiation into neural impulses.
			Allows me to see.
			Without it, you are blind?
			Yes...
			How did this happen?
			I was born that way.
			And your parents let you live?
			What kind of question is that?
			Of course they let me live.
			No wonder your race is weak. You
			waste time and resources on
			defective children...
			Defective? Listen, Commodore --
			I'm a chief engineer in Starfleet.
			You don't get there by being
			defective.
			But if you can't see...
			I can see things you can't even
			imagine.
			Whoa...
			I'm having some sort of polarity
			shift. The diagnostic insists
			everything's fine...
			Your body temperature's gone up
			another full degree...
			What are you saying?
			It's this place... All that
			electromagnetic soup is playing
			hell with our nervous systems.
			Your metabolism's messed up...
			so's my interface with the VISOR.
			We've got to get out of here
			while we still can.
			Sit down.
			Bochra...
			Sit down.
			What's that?
			Just a background fluctuation,
			Commander... he hasn't found it
			yet.
			Then he must be hurt... or dead.
			How long before another window,
			Data?
			There are none indicated,
			Commander. I have no way to
			predict.
			Incoming Romulan transmission,
			Captain.
			They're early.
			The Romulan warbird should still
			be twenty-nine minutes away from
			the edge of the Neutral Zone.
			Close enough, however, to see
			we're not there.
			On screen.
			Picard, I'm approaching the
			Federation border and the
			Enterprise is not to be found.
			Why?
			My away team has not been able
			to leave the surface because of
			the storms.
			And my officer?
			He is alive.
			His life remains in jeopardy?
			Yes.
			And yet you will still not permit
			me to cross into your precious
			Federation space to retrieve
			him...
			If the point hasn't been made
			clearly, Commander, let me make
			it again.
			Romulan warships do not enter
			Federation space unless they are
			prepared to do battle.
			But a mission of mercy...
			A mission to recover one of your
			officers who was caught on a
			Federation planet. For reasons
			still unknown...
			I have already explained that.
			And I have rejected your
			explanation.
			Territories... you would measure
			territories against a man's life?
			Commander, your singular concern
			for a life is impressive. Do
			not risk any more lives by leaving
			the Neutral Zone. Picard out.
			Bochra, you're in bad shape.
			My vision's getting worse.
			There's a beacon out there...
			it'll get us back to my ship...
			but not if I can't find it.
			I can't surrender to the
			Federation.
			Then stay here and die.
			If the situation were reversed...
			would you not die to avoid
			capture?
			I don't know. I might... if I
			thought it was necessary. If the
			stakes were high enough.
			But they'd have to be pretty damn
			high.
			Guess I'd make a pretty lousy
			Romulan, huh... ?
			I no more wish to die than you
			do.
			You mean Romulans aren't always
			ready to sacrifice themselves on
			command?
			No more than humans are frail,
			weak-willed children without any
			conception of loyalty or duty.
			Bochra -- there are times when
			dying for one's ideals is
			necessary.
			Do you believe this is one of
			those times?
			Let's find that beacon.
			What is it?
			Everything's gone blank.
			I'm blind.
			Come.
			You are busy. Forgive my
			intrusion.
			For what it's worth, I understand
			your bitterness.
			With respect, sir... you cannot.
			I am asked to give up the very
			lifeblood of my mother, of my
			father, to those who murdered
			them.
			Must you blame all Romulans for
			that?
			Yes.
			Forever, Worf?
			What if the Federation should make
			peace with the Romulans someday...
			Impossible.
			Not long ago, your people said
			the same thing about humans.
			And so many on both sides died
			in that war. How could you and
			I be here now... like this...
			if we were unable to let go of
			the anger, the blame.
			When does it end, Worf? If the
			Romulan dies, does his family
			carry the bitterness forward
			another generation?
			Then you believe I should.
			What I believe doesn't matter.
			My Starfleet training tells me
			one thing. Everything I am tells
			me another.
			Lieutenant Worf, report to
			Sickbay.
			Acknowledged.
			Lieutenant, his life is coming
			to an end. I thought it important
			for you to see him again.
			It is not too late to change your
			mind.
			Come close to me, Klingon. Let
			me die with my hands at your
			throat.
			I am the only one who can keep
			you alive.
			You?
			There is a substance within my
			cells which you need to survive...
			You have come to hear me beg for
			my life.
			No.
			I would rather die than pollute
			my body with Klingon filth.
			I have lost almost all feeling
			in my legs.
			My synapses must be turning to
			jelly. The VISOR's fine, but I
			can't see a thing.
			How do we locate the beacon?
			We don't.
			Do all humans give up so easily?
			Are all Romulans so pushy?
			Bochra, we're lost... unless
			you've got something that can
			smell neutrinos.
			We have the sensor device you were
			carrying.
			My tricorder? It isn't set up
			to detect neutrinos.
			But your eye device does. Connect
			them.
			That's crazy. They don't speak
			the same language. I'd never get
			an accurate sampling...
			But, then, I don't need an
			accurate sampling. I just need
			a pointer... a neutrino Geiger
			counter.
			Still not possible.
			You cannot do it?
			Under normal circumstances, maybe.
			Here, no way.
			Why?
			Because I can't see. Adapting
			the neural output pods of the
			VISOR is tricky work. It can't
			be done by "touch."
			Then I'll be your eyes.
			The storm is beginning to subside,
			Captain... we should have a
			window in less than an hour...
			Still no indication he's found
			the beacon, sir...
			Assemble an away team...
			Yes, sir...
			Captain... the Romulan warship
			has crossed the Neutral Zone
			border. It is in Federation space
			and heading toward us.
			Stand by, Number One.
			Red Alert.
			... make sure the scan select
			limiter matches the VISOR output
			range.
			Not so fast...
			Done.
			Now close the case and place the
			neural output pods in contact
			with the tricorder scanner heads.
			Ready.
			Let her rip.
			Bearing three-five-zero.
			We did it! The first
			Federation-Romulan co-venture.
			The storm may be breaking.
			With any luck an electromagnetic
			window will be opening up and we
			can get out of here.
			At which point I'll be your
			prisoner.
			Can you walk?
			I don't know...
			Straight ahead...
			You wished to see me, Captain.
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			I assume you know what this is
			about...
			The Romulan ship will reach us
			within the hour, Lieutenant. If
			our patient dies... it may be
			just the excuse the Romulan
			commander needs to start an
			incident. The death of a Romulan
			officer at the hands of the
			Federation! Think of it.
			I have, Captain.
			There is no question that this
			Romulan is more valuable to us
			alive than dead, Lieutenant.
			I understand.
			Sometimes the moral obligations
			of command are less than clear.
			I weigh the good of the many
			against the needs of the
			individual... and try to balance
			them as realistically as possible.
			God knows I don't always succeed.
			I have not had cause to complain,
			Captain.
			You wouldn't complain even if you
			had cause, Lieutenant.
			If you order me to agree to the
			transfusion, I will, of course,
			obey.
			I cannot order you. I will not
			order you, Lieutenant. But I ask
			you. I beg you to volunteer.
			I cannot, Captain.
			Lieutenant...
			Sir?
			Dismissed.
			Picard to Doctor Crusher.
			Go ahead.
			Do not continue to enlist
			Lieutenant Worf's assistance.
			I won't have to, Captain. The
			Romulan has died.
			We've found it.
			Now we have to change its signal
			pattern so the Enterprise knows
			we've found it.
			Will that be difficult?
			Not with your help.
			Scanners show a window, Captain.
			Estimated duration?
			Nine minutes, forty seconds.
			No change in the neutrino beacon
			signal, sir.
			Romulan ship approaching. Bearing
			three-fifty-four mark
			two-eight-seven.
			On screen.
			Romulan is entering phaser range.
			We are being hailed, sir.
			On screen.
			You have one chance to escape
			destruction, Picard. Return my
			officer at once.
			You have entered Federation space
			despite my warning, Commander.
			You forced this situation. I will
			not leave without him.
			He is dead.
			Then he is but the first to fall,
			Picard.
			The Romulan ship is routing power
			to its forward disruptor array.
			All shields to maximum.
			Aye, sir.
			Lock phasers on target.
			Phasers locked and ready.
			Captain -- the signal pattern from
			the neutrino beacon is modulating.
			Geordi!
			We can't transport him with our
			shields up.
			If we lower our shields, the
			Romulan will strike.
			The electromagnetic window on the
			planet is closing. Three minutes
			remain.
			Transporter Room. Lock onto the
			coordinates of the neutrino beacon
			and stand by.
			Standing by, Captain.
			Captain, the window is allowing
			intermittant sensor readings...
			There are still numerous ghost
			images, but I believe we are
			picking up two life forms near
			the beacon...
			Another Romulan?
			I cannot say. The electromagnetic
			interference prevents an accurate
			reading.
			But it is a likely hypothesis,
			Number One. If Mister La Forge
			located a second survivor...
			Hail the Romulan ship, Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			They're ignoring our hail, sir.
			Repeat the hail -- all channels.
			He has no way of knowing how
			accurate our sensors are... put
			on your poker face, Number One...
			Open frequency.
			Commander Tomalak. It would
			appear our away team has rescued
			a second man from your one man
			ship.
			They are on the surface, ready
			to beam up. We are preparing
			to do so.
			After which we will return the
			survivor to you.
			No acknowledgement, Captain.
			Commander, both our ships are
			ready to fight. We have two
			supremely powerful, destructive
			arsenals at our command. Our next
			actions will have serious
			repercussions for both sides.
			We have good reason to mistrust
			one another, Commander, but we
			have better reasons to set our
			differences aside. The question,
			of course, is who will show
			vulnerability first.
			The answer is -- I will. I must
			lower my shields to transport
			these men off the planet surface.
			Once the shields are down, you
			will have an opportunity to open
			fire. If you do, you will not
			only destroy the Enterprise and
			its crew -- but also the
			cease-fire that the Romulans and
			the Federation now enjoy.
			Lieutenant, lower the shields.
			Leave hailing frequencies open.
			Yes, sir.
			Mister O'Brien. Transport Mister
			La Forge and the Romulan directly
			to the bridge.
			Aye, sir. Energizing.
			Security team to bridge.
			Belay that order, Lieutenant.
			Shields up.
			No one is going to harm you.
			You have my word.
			Well, Commander?
			If he has been in any way
			mistreated...
			I have given them no information,
			Commander -- but I have not been
			mistreated.
			In fact, this human saved my life.
			Commander, how is it possible you
			didn't know of this second
			Romulan on Galorndon Core?
			A simple misunderstanding, Captain
			Picard. I was obviously
			misinformed as to the size of the
			craft. I assure you, I intended
			no deception.
			Of course not.
			You doubt my good faith?
			Let's just say my faith would be
			strengthened with a gesture --
			such as powering down your
			disruptors.
			Disruptors powering down, Captain.
			Thank you. Cancel Red Alert,
			Lieutenant.
			We will return your officer and
			escort your ship back to the
			Neutral Zone, Commander.
			That is acceptable.
			Mister La Forge, it's good to have
			you back.
			I have Centurion Bochra to thank,
			sir.
			Your vision is returning...
			Yeah, gradually. Your heart
			rate's slowing down.
			Mister La Forge, Mister Worf --
			escort our guest to Transporter
			Room One.
			Aye, sir.
			Close call.
			Too close, Number One.
			Brinksmanship is a dangerous
			game...
			It was not in my power to save
			him.
			He was a loyal officer.
			Lieutenant Commander La Forge.
			Centurion Bochra.
			You're not what I expected of a
			Federation officer.
			That's okay; you're not what I
			expected of a Romulan, either.
			That's a compliment.
			That's the way to fight all the
			wars from now on. Two guys on
			a planet with no one else to talk
			to and nowhere to go. Things get
			settled in a hurry.
			I'm gonna sleep for four days...
