			Someone sure stripped this place.
			The reactor is gone.
			That's why no one answered our
			hail for two days -- they had
			nothing to answer it with.
			Life signs five meters straight
			ahead, Commander.
			Blood?
			Yes, but not human. I'll have
			to do some analysis on it.
			It's jammed.
			The two scientists are suffering
			from phaser stuns... I'd guess
			several hits each.
			Several... when one would surely
			have sufficed.
			It'll take us a while to bring
			them around, but they'll recover.
			We found a sample of blood. It's
			a rare iron-copper composite,
			unique to one humanoid species:
			the Acamarians.
			Acamarians.
			That would suggest... the
			Gatherers.
			A likely hypothesis. The nomadic
			marauders who refer to themselves
			as Gatherers have raided other
			outposts in neighboring sectors.
			But they've never ventured this
			far before.
			And we cannot permit them to
			spread their violent ways further.
			Mister Crusher, set course for
			the Acamar system.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43562.9.
			In an effort to put an end to the
			Gatherer raids, we have come to
			the Acamar System to enlist the
			aid of Marouk, the sovereign of
			Acamar Three.
			Their raids have made this sector
			unsafe. Our research facilities
			have been ransacked; trade routes
			disrupted...
			The Gatherers are elusive; we've
			only managed to capture a handful
			of them. However, with
			Starfleet's help...
			Hunting them down is not what
			I'm proposing.
			Reconciliation with the Gatherers
			is impossible. It's been tried.
			Every time we've offered amnesty,
			they've rejected it.
			When was the last attempt made?
			Eighteen years ago.
			Eighteen years?
			Yes. We gave up trying.
			Why?
			Because the Gatherers aren't
			willing to change! For almost
			a century, they've been
			parasites... moving from star
			system to star system, living on
			what they could find... or steal.
			They're little more than
			barbarians.
			They are still your people.
			No. Captain, you have to
			understand our history. A hundred
			years ago, before the Gatherers
			split off from our culture, we
			were a savage, violent race.
			Clans battled clans... bloody,
			vengeful feuds that lasted for
			generations.
			But we overcame those ways...
			broke the cycle of fighting and
			revenge. All except the
			Gatherers.
			After a century of wandering,
			they may be ready to come home.
			Despite all your progress, your
			society is still divided. And
			it will remain so until the
			Gatherers return to Acamar.
			The attempt may be futile.
			You have much to gain and little
			to lose in making the effort.
			The problem affects us all... it
			cannot be ignored.
			Sovereign Marouk, how soon will
			you be ready to leave Acamar?
			I am ready now, Captain. I need
			only bring aboard two more
			servants...
			I'll see to that... and to your
			accommodations, Sovereign.
			I have reason to believe there
			is a Gatherer encampment somewhere
			in the Hromi Cluster.
			Mister Data?
			The Federation has charted but
			not explored several Class M
			planets in that area. Any of
			those planets might well serve
			as a base.
			Mister Crusher, set course for
			the Hromi Cluster.
			Aye, sir.
			A fine ship, Commander.
			We're very proud of her.
			Yuta --
			A light meal in twenty minutes.
			May I be shown to the kitchen,
			Commander?
			You're the chef?
			Yes. I'll prepare all meals for
			the sovereign and her servants.
			We can provide you with a kitchen
			if you wish... but it's not really
			necessary. The food dispensers
			can synthesize anything you want.
			I'll show you.
			Sovereign, may I offer you a
			drink?
			Yes, thank you. Cold water.
			A glass of water... five degrees.
			Please.
			You're also the food taster?
			That's part of the cook's duties.
			I'm sure the sovereign will wish
			to sample many of the cuisines
			your ship has to offer, but there
			are certain Acamarian dishes she
			will insist upon.
			I'll arrange for a technician to
			help you program your recipes
			into the computer. I'd like to
			try some myself. What's your
			specialty?
			I have none.
			Don't be modest. You can't tell
			me you haven't come up with a
			few original triumphs...
			There is a spiced parthus dish...
			"Parthus?"
			A green vegetable with fleshy
			roots.
			Ah. Parthus... a la Yuta. I
			look forward to tasting it.
			Sovereign...
			Chef...
			Entering standard orbit of Gamma
			Hromi Two, sir.
			I am detecting life readings on
			the surface, sir... and several
			small areas of heat and carbon
			dioxide emission indicative of
			combustion.
			Campfires, Data.
			It's worth a look.
			Make it so.
			Artonian lasers, Tonkian homing
			beacons... quite a collection.
			Noranium alloys. Their salvage
			value is low.
			Looks like the Gatherers aren't
			very discriminating in what they
			steal.
			The spoils of animals without
			honor.
			Commander.
			Ambush!
			Rigellian phaser rifles. Not very
			powerful.
			Powerful enough...
			We want to talk --
			Your words are wasted, Commander.
			They understand only this.
			We're here to establish a
			dialogue.
			Data... noranium vaporizes at... ?
			Two thousand three hundred
			fourteen degrees. Of course,
			noranium carbide alloys vaporize
			at a slightly higher temperature.
			Phaser setting seven ought to do
			it...
			Now!
			Enterprise -- four to beam up!
			Energize!
			Cowards.
			Your ambushes would be more
			successful if you bathed more
			often.
			We've brought the sovereign of
			Acamar...
			Marouk... here?
			With an offer of amnesty.
			Full dispensation will be extended
			to all Gatherers who are willing
			to return to Acamar Three.
			You don't trust me.
			Should I?
			Oh, but you expect me to trust
			you. Perhaps you just poisoned
			it yourself.
			Taste it.
			Barbarians... this is futile...
			Sovereign...
			Go home, old woman...
			Brull...
			You people haven't changed in a
			hundred years.
			You were there. You should know.
			Sit down.
			We are here to talk.
			It is a waste of time, Captain...
			they don't care how they live...
			And I am supposed to believe that
			you do care how we live?
			Yes.
			She is here, isn't she, Brull?
			Perhaps you forced her...
			Nobody forces me anywhere,
			Brull... nobody.
			What is there for us on Acamar
			Three?
			A life. A home. You can end your
			wandering, your miserable
			existence...
			Do I look miserable?
			The clan wars are over, Brull.
			It is a past we are ashamed of.
			It is why you had to leave.
			Now it is time to come home.
			I want to talk privately with
			Picard and Marouk. Everyone else
			-- leave.
			Any insights, Counselor?
			Brull's ready to negotiate. He
			wants privacy so he won't appear
			weak in the presence of the other
			Gatherers.
			You are of the clan Lornack.
			So?
			I've seen you before.
			Yes.
			But it's impossible.
			No. Look closer.
			I am Yuta --
			-- of the clan Tralesta.
			I am the last of my line. But
			my clan will outlive yours.
			Marouk's offer has value...
			still, I'm not sure...
			But you agree it's worth
			presenting to your leader.
			Chorgan is a better judge of such
			things... I will go to him... you
			will hear from me in twenty days.
			Brull, in twenty days, I hope to
			be... very far away from here.
			With all due respect, Brull, I
			would like to make the offer to
			Chorgan myself.
			We will gladly take you with
			us aboard the Enterprise. It will
			give you a chance to enjoy
			Federation hospitality. How many
			of your men do you want to
			accompany you?
			I'll come alone. If this is a
			trap --
			It isn't.
			Mallon -- you'll take charge while
			I'm gone. If I don't return in
			ten days --
			Brull!
			Away team to Enterprise. Medical
			Emergency.
			Volnoth was an old man. There's
			nothing to be done.
			There's a chance our doctors can
			do something...
			You found him?
			Yes. And there are no other
			members of the Lornack clan
			here... so I claim his
			possessions.
			Granted.
			Have you no respect for the dead?
			What's there to respect about a
			corpse?
			He's been dead too long.
			How?
			Cardiac arrest...
			You don't sound convinced.
			No, it was a heart attack, all
			right. But I can't figure out
			what caused it. Cardiac muscle
			is strong... no sign of arterial
			occlusion...
			Is there anything you need to
			bring with you, Brull?
			Like what?
			Anything... a change of clothes,
			perhaps...
			No, I just changed into these...
			recently.
			Very well then...
			Picard to Enterprise... two...
			My quarters are to be just as big
			as hers...
			Two to beam up...
			Brull -- show Mister Crusher the
			course to plot.
			A child?
			That "child" is one of the finest
			ensigns under my command. He also
			happens to pilot this ship.
			That does not inspire my
			confidence. But if you want me
			to show him, I'll show him.
			This is our present position.
			Then set a heading of three-four-
			three mark seven-two.
			That'll take us through the center
			of an asteroid belt.
			What's the matter -- can't you
			fly your way around a couple of
			rocks?
			Sure I can. But if we take this
			heading...
			... we avoid the belt entirely,
			and we only lose twelve point one
			minutes at warp seven.
			Have it your way.
			For centuries, my planet was in
			chaos. Loyalty to one's clan was
			absolute, and the slightest injury
			to one member demanded violent
			retaliation.
			And these blood feuds could last
			for decades?
			The obsession for vengeance would
			be passed on from generation to
			generation. And with each act
			of retribution, the violence would
			escalate...
			It's not unlike the history of
			my own planet, Marouk.
			Your pardon, Sovereign; may I be
			excused briefly? Commander Riker
			requested I prepare him an
			Acamarian dish.
			Of course, Yuta.
			What are you doing?
			My studies.
			What is this?
			Math.
			I can see that. What's it mean?
			It's the locally Euclidean
			metrization of a k-fold
			contravariant Riemannian tensor
			field.
			You good at it?
			You don't like me.
			I didn't say --
			That's no problem. I have many
			friends that don't like me.
			What do you know about me?
			You're a thief.
			I do it to survive -- not because
			I enjoy it.
			And we Gatherers value freedom.
			We do as we want and answer to
			no creature.
			But you're helping Sovereign
			Marouk to change all that...
			Maybe I just want something
			better... for me, and for my
			children.
			You have children?
			Two sons. One's almost your age.
			He's not so good at math.
			Parthus a la Yuta?
			With the help of one of your food
			stations.
			It's wonderful.
			Truly excellent.
			Thank you.
			Will you join us?
			I don't want to intrude...
			Not at all; I was just about to
			leave. Please -- sit down.
			It really is delicious.
			I am glad it pleases you,
			Commander.
			I'm not your commander. My name
			is William.
			I will call you William if you
			prefer.
			I do. You say "Commander" to me
			the same way you say "Sovereign"
			to Marouk.
			As a servant.
			You're an excellent commander,
			but you'd make a poor sovereign.
			Why's that? Not that I
			disagree...
			You're not comfortable with
			servants.
			No. I prefer the company of
			equals.
			So you treat me as an equal.
			And you're not comfortable with
			that?
			I'm not used to it. I've always
			been a servant. I'm not
			complaining -- the sovereign
			treats me well. I have all that
			I could want.
			What about freedom?
			I can never have that.
			You're the property of the
			sovereign?
			No. I'm not her slave. I can
			leave whenever I wish.
			But you have no place to go?
			Just the opposite. My path is
			all too clear.
			Yuta, you're an excellent cook,
			but you talk in riddles.
			I've never been very good at
			conversation.
			I think the sovereign wants me
			to return. Enjoy the Parthus.
			Sickbay to Commander Riker. I've
			discovered something interesting,
			Will...
			I'll be right there...
			Doctor, you're scowling.
			I'm thinking.
			And?
			The old Gatherer on the planet?
			I've found what caused his heart
			attack.
			The medical tricorder almost
			missed it, but there was a
			microvirus in his body... it
			attached to parasympathetic
			nerves and acted as a
			cholinesterase inhibitor, blocking
			autonomic nerve impulses.
			And that stopped his heart?
			But here's the interesting part.
			The microvirus will only attach
			to cells which contain a very
			specific DNA sequence.
			How specific?
			Without knowing more about their
			genetic makeup, I can't be sure...
			but my guess is, this virus would
			only kill one Acamarian in a
			million.
			That's an awfully single-minded
			bug.
			Too single-minded. I can't
			believe it's a naturally occurring
			virus.
			Meaning somebody engineered it...
			Meaning Volnoth was murdered.
			Sir, Acamar Three has agreed to
			your request for access to its
			databases. They are now
			transmitting them to our computer
			over subspace link.
			Good. Notify Doctor Crusher when
			Acamar's medical database is
			online. Riker out.
			Come in.
			I'm disturbing you.
			Not at all.
			As the sovereign has no further
			need of my services this evening,
			she suggested I might spend some
			time with you.
			What a charming suggestion...
			She appreciates the... affection
			... you have shown me.
			Was it so obvious...
			Yes.
			Well, I've already dined... but,
			maybe you know a good Acamarian
			dessert recipe.
			Does that please you?
			Tell me what you want, William.
			I will do anything you wish...
			You've got the night off,
			remember?
			I don't understand.
			You don't want me to give you
			pleasure?
			Not as a servant. I told you...
			I prefer equals.
			Even in matters of love?
			Especially in matters of love.
			I've offended you.
			No.
			I only want to make you as happy
			as you want to make me. You're
			entitled to that...
			No. I'm not.
			Yuta...
			I do not feel pleasure. Or
			passion. I haven't been able
			to... for a long time.
			I don't know who did this to you
			or why... but it can change.
			I wish it could. Tonight most
			of all.
			I'm sorry...
			Your people have provided a warm
			welcome.
			That's Chorgan's ship.
			Shields holding.
			Worf -- contact Chorgan and tell
			him Brull has brought us here to
			talk.
			Chorgan's not responding.
			Mister Worf, can we knock out
			their shields without seriously
			damaging their ship?
			I believe we can, sir.
			Prepare phasers and open
			channel...
			Phasers locked. Channel open,
			Captain.
			This is Jean-Luc Picard...
			Let's focus their attention.
			Fire.
			Their forward shields are
			inoperative.
			Well done, Lieutenant.
			They're hailing us, sir.
			That's better.
			On screen.
			Brull -- you traitor! You led
			them here to destroy me --
			Chorgan, if I had wanted you
			destroyed, you wouldn't be talking
			now.
			Obviously, I want something else.
			And what is that?
			I have on board Sovereign Marouk
			of Acamar Three. I want you to
			hear what she and Brull have to
			say.
			It's worth listening to her,
			Chorgan.
			I don't wish to hear either of
			you.
			You have no choice. Prepare to
			receive us -- we're coming aboard
			your ship. Picard out.
			Cancel Red Alert. Have Sovereign
			Marouk meet me in Transporter
			Three.
			Aye, sir.
			You're going alone, Captain?
			The danger is minimal, Number One.
			Chorgan's not likely to do
			anything rash while the
			Enterprise's phasers are trained
			upon his ship.
			It's still a risk.
			For these negotiations to succeed,
			I must be a mediator -- not an
			enforcer.
			You have the bridge, Number One.
			Chorgan. May I introduce
			Sovereign Marouk.
			You may sit.
			I think you will find Marouk's
			proposal --
			You know, Picard -- I could take
			you prisoner.
			Don't worry, I've no intention
			of doing so. You've gone to a
			lot of trouble to get here -- I'm
			curious why.
			Then let's proceed.
			Quite simply, I propose amnesty
			for every Gatherer...
			Amnesty. You mean slavery.
			Chorgan, if you want to know what
			I think...
			I don't.
			Say what you came to say. But
			I tell you right now I doubt that
			I'll believe it.
			I didn't believe this very
			persuasive Federation captain
			when he suggested that we could
			reconcile our differences. But
			I am convinced now it is the right
			thing not just for you, but for
			us too. We need you back.
			I've brought some Acamarian
			brandy... I'm sure it's been a
			long time...
			You have spent a century hunting
			us down --
			She's trying to put an end to
			that.
			By luring us back and putting us
			in prisons.
			No -- by accepting you back as
			free men.
			And will you feed and clothe us,
			too?
			No, of course I won't!
			What I will do is give you the
			means to feed and clothe
			yourselves. We've already set
			aside land you can...
			Do we look like farmers to you?
			Then don't farm. Use the land
			as you wish. It is yours. And
			the moment you set foot on it,
			you'll be better off than you are
			today. You won't be running any
			longer...
			We would need autonomy...
			Autonomy...
			Let us acknowledge, Sovereign,
			that Chorgan appears willing to
			discuss your offer...
			There are many levels of autonomy,
			certainly your region would have
			home rights...
			Those rights will be spelled out
			before I agree to anything...
			Commander, I'm afraid the only
			entry on Volnoth in the Acamarian
			database is a birth record.
			Probably one of the last of the
			Gatherers to be born on their
			planet.
			I've been digging through the
			medical database from Acamar Three
			for hours and I've found another
			victim of the microvirus that
			killed Volnoth. But just one.
			Fifty-three years ago. A Gatherer
			named Penthor-Mul.
			Data -- got anything in your files
			on this Penthor-Mul?
			Yes. He was captured while
			leading a Gatherer raid on an
			Acamarian outpost. He died of
			a heart attack before his trial
			ended.
			Commander, he was a member of the
			Lornack Clan.
			Display Volnoth's birth record
			again.
			Lornack... the same clan....
			The only two recorded deaths from
			this microvirus... members of
			the same clan... what does that
			tell us, Doctor?
			If these microbes were engineered
			for murder, I'd say somebody's
			going after the whole family.
			Commander, Chorgan, the present
			leader of the Gatherers, is also
			from the Lornack clan.
			I want to know just how this clan
			was involved in the Acamarian
			blood feuds... any clues to their
			enemies you can find...
			How could this virus be
			transmitted?
			More ways than I can count. And
			it's perfectly safe to the
			carrier... as long as he doesn't
			have the same DNA patterns.
			Tailor made for their victims...
			Sir, eighty years ago, the
			Lornacks massacred a rival clan,
			the Tralestas. It ended a feud
			that had lasted for two hundred
			years.
			Ended it?
			According to these records, there
			were no survivors. The Tralesta
			clan was annihilated.
			Something tells me they may not
			have all been wiped out.
			There's got to be a missing link
			here...
			Computer, any members of the
			Acamarian delegation in the
			Tralesta clan?
			Clan affiliation is not within
			provided records.
			Commander, I believe I have found
			a correlation between the two
			deaths... your "missing link" ...
			That is Penthor-Mul being led
			from his trial.
			I don't see the connection...
			Behind him to the left, sir...
			Computer, scan left and magnify.
			The computer can extrapolate and
			reconstruct the rest of the face,
			sir.
			Do it.
			But the photograph was taken over
			fifty years ago.
			Fifty-three years... and she
			hasn't aged a day.
			Three seats on the ruling council?
			If we're going to be subject to
			your laws, we want a part in
			making them.
			I agree you're entitled to
			representation... but not on the
			ruling council.
			Unacceptable. The real power is
			in the council. You're trying
			to shut us out already --
			No -- you're trying to take too
			much! No group has three seats
			on the council.
			I don't care what others have --
			Yes -- you only care about what
			you can take.
			Sovereign -- were the situation
			reversed, you would be demanding
			the same levels of representation.
			You're right, Captain.
			I apologize for my temper.
			Perhaps a short pause would be
			helpful.
			I agree.
			Maybe a taste of that brandy...
			Excellent thought. Yuta...
			It's quite remarkable how much
			alike the two of you actually
			are...
			I'm being quite honest... both
			able negotiators... strong
			leaders.
			We don't obey weak leaders.
			We have nothing at all in
			common... we have agreed to
			nothing...
			Wrong, Chorgan... we've agreed to
			have some brandy together.
			Treachery! A Federation trap --
			Don't move!
			Chorgan, I assure you Commander
			Riker has a good reason for his
			actions...
			... you do, Number One?
			Yuta. Move away from Chorgan.
			Do it.
			Why?
			Because of a man you once knew...
			Penthor-Mul.
			Penthar-Mul? How do you know
			Penthar-Mul?
			He was murdered fifty years ago...
			Murdered... ? That's not so...
			he died of...
			He was killed just as Volnoth
			was... by a deadly virus designed
			to attack your clan...
			What do you mean? Designed by
			whom... ?
			Tell him, Yuta...
			I don't understand.
			You were with Penthor-Mul when
			he died...
			If it was fifty years ago... how
			could I...
			I know, Yuta...
			Stop! Chorgan -- keep perfectly
			still. Your life is in danger.
			Yuta -- step back.
			William, this is not your concern.
			It is now. You're about to commit
			murder.
			It isn't murder. It's justice.
			Who are you?
			Yuta... of the clan Tralesta.
			There are no more Tralestas.
			Five survived the last Lornack
			raid... but on that day a century
			ago, my life ended and my search
			began. I was the one chosen...
			transformed... my cells were
			altered... my aging slowed...
			enough to finish my task.
			Murdering innocent people -- is
			that your task?
			He's not innocent. He's a
			Lornack.
			You used me in order to get to
			the last few you couldn't reach.
			Yes, Sovereign.
			You'll never leave this ship.
			If I don't kill you myself, my
			men will.
			You are the last. Once you're
			dead, what happens to me doesn't
			matter.
			Yuta... the wars are over.
			You cannot understand...
			No, I can't. You're right.
			Because I've seen the part of you
			that regrets what you have
			become... Yuta, listen to me...
			you don't have to do this any
			more.
			I have no choice.
			You do...
			William... I --
			I'm... sorry.
			Don't --
			Commander, I'm in your debt...
			New orders from Starfleet.
			The rendezvous with the Goddard
			has been postponed.
			And in the meantime?
			Starbase three four three. We're
			to take on medical supplies for
			the Alpha Leonis system.
			Sounds pretty routine.
			With the Gatherer truce in effect,
			it should be.
			We won't require a full ship's
			complement. I'm going to extend
			shore leave on the starbase to
			anyone who wants it.
			I'll pass that along to the crew,
			Captain.
			Parthus. A la Yuta.
