			Captain's log, Stardate 43042.3.
			We are cautiously entering the
			Delta Rana star system three
			days after receiving a distress
			call from the Federation colony
			on its ninth planet.
			The garbled transmission reported
			the colony under attack from an
			unidentified spacecraft. Our
			mission is one of rescue and --
			if necessary -- confrontation with
			a hostile force.
			Shields up, maximum strength.
			Shields up.
			Sensors do not indicate the
			presence of any armed space
			vehicles operating in the Rana
			system.
			They could be cloaked or otherwise
			shielded.
			Mister Crusher, bring us in well
			clear of the planet's three moons.
			Aye, sir.
			Commander, I am not receiving
			Rana Four's call sign.
			Open a frequency to Colony
			Operations.
			There is no response. Rana Four
			is emissions quiet.
			Captain, there are eleven thousand
			inhabitants in the colony. At
			this range I should be feeling
			something.... I'm not.
			Mister Data, put the planet
			on the Main Viewer.
			Magnify.
			My God...
			Helm, put us in a high equatorial
			orbit. Scan for survivors.
			Survivors? Down there?
			Sensors are scanning ninety
			degrees of longitude as we orbit.
			I am detecting no artificial
			structures, no vegetation, no
			bodies of water...
			Lifeform readings are negative.
			Could the colonists have escaped?
			That is unlikely. Rana Four
			possessed no interstellar
			spacecraft.
			Who could cause devastation on
			such a scale?
			Hold it -- hold it! I'm getting
			something at thirty-seven degrees
			north, sixty-two degrees east --
			a structure!
			Life?
			Two lifeforms. Possibly human.
			Put the area on the Main Viewer
			and magnify.
			The structure is located at the
			center of the vegetation.
			An entire planet obliterated...
			except for a few acres of trees
			and grass... and one building?
			It's some kind of illusion...
			Negative. It is as you see it.
			Number One, I think you had better
			see who's home...
			If they're the only survivors
			of a global holocaust, they can't
			be in very good shape.
			Counselor... ?
			What I sense of them is human...
			And something else... ?
			It's difficult to explain... I
			feel these two people are
			somehow... different.
			I'm sorry. I cannot be any
			clearer than that.
			We're ready.
			Good luck, Number One.
			Energize...
			What can you tell me?
			The house is a typical settlement
			structure with adaptations. Its
			thermal properties all seem to
			conform to known materials.
			If there are indicators as to why
			this particular area has remained
			intact, I cannot detect them.
			Worf, the interior of the house.
			One individual is located at the
			south end of the house, the other
			toward the north. There is a
			weapon -- a low-yield phaser,
			nonfunctional -- in proximity to
			the front-room individual.
			I guess a frontal assault is
			unwarranted. Stay here. I'm
			going to try an old-fashioned
			knock on the door.
			Commander, there's a --
			Who's there? Who are you people?
			Commander William Riker, USS
			Enterprise, and crewmembers. May
			I get down and approach you, sir?
			You leave him right where he is.
			Commander, shall I incapacitate
			him?
			No.
			We're a rescue party. We picked
			up your colony's distress call
			and came as fast as we could.
			Kevin, what are you doing? Can't
			you see they're here to help us?
			Can't you see they're human?
			Stay in the house, Rishon. It
			could be some kind of trick.
			We'd just about given up hope.
			We thought maybe the whole
			Federation had been attacked.
			Do you know of any other
			survivors?
			It's been days since we've seen
			or heard anybody else...
			Please, no -- don't tell me we're
			the only ones...
			They came in a spaceship so big
			you could see it up in orbit.
			They took our world apart piece
			by piece.
			Who?
			We don't know. We never saw
			their faces.
			You don't know where they came
			from -- where they are now?
			I guess they've gone away.
			I'm sorry. I'm only performing
			a physical. Could I have your
			names please -- for the record.
			I'm Rishon Uxbridge... and this
			is my husband Kevin.
			Botanists. Originally from the
			aquatic city New Martim Vaz in
			the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.
			Residents of the Rana Four
			colony for five years.
			You, ma'am, are eighty-two years
			of age and a composer of
			Tao-classical music.
			You, sir, are eighty-five years
			of age and a specialist in
			symbiotic plantlife. You have
			been married fifty-three years.
			I memorized the colony register
			on the way to Rana in the event
			such information was needed.
			Is something wrong?
			Your house -- with your permission
			I'd like to look inside.
			Why? What could interest you
			in there?
			Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've
			been able to determine, you and
			your wife -- and this house --
			are all that survived the attack.
			It was either a bizarre
			coincidence or by design. I
			don't favor the coincidence
			theory.
			Are you saying we were left alive
			intentionally?
			Yes.
			I don't understand. You don't
			think Rishon and I did something
			to merit our survival, do you?
			I mean, betrayed the others... ?
			I'm not accusing you of anything,
			Mister Uxbridge. The attacking
			force spared you for some reason.
			We're only trying to find out why.
			May I look inside... ?
			I said you could.
			I'll make a cup of tea for
			everyone. We have wonderful tea
			on Rana. It grows wild nearly
			everywhere...
			Sir, may I say that your attempt
			to hold our away team at bay with
			a nonfunctioning weapon was an
			act of unmitigated gall.
			Didn't fool you, huh?
			I admire gall.
			Excuse me. Out front -- that
			was about the best job of
			concealing a snare that I've ever
			seen. Could you tell me what it
			was for?
			Got a local critter that's
			developed a taste for what's in
			the garden.
			Guess I should've dismantled it.
			Guess I don't have to worry about
			him anymore.
			Go ahead. Pick it up. It's a
			music box. It's been in my
			family for generations.
			I've been in every room. There's
			nothing unusual about this house
			except that it's here. What about
			them?
			They're in reasonably good health.
			Both show signs of mental stress.
			Understandable considering what
			they've been through.
			But somehow they're different.
			Let's get back to the ship. We'll
			take them with us.
			Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We have
			to return to the ship now.
			Commander, I haven't finished
			fixing your tea --
			I'm sorry, but we're finished
			here. We can give you and Kevin
			time to pack. You can bring as
			much as you want.
			What do you mean pack?
			You're not thinking of taking us
			with you, are you?
			Surely you don't want to remain
			here. How will you take care of
			yourselves?
			Kevin, I can't leave my home!
			Don't let them do this to us.
			No one's going to make us leave.
			You'll be protected on the ship.
			You could still be in danger on
			Rana.
			Commander, we appreciate your
			concern but we're not going
			anywhere. We'll manage. We
			always have.
			All right. I can't make you come
			with us. Are you familiar with
			one of these... ?
			We'll remain in this system for
			the next several days at least.
			If you should reconsider, please
			contact us.
			We'll be fine, Commander. We have
			each other...
			Are they collaborators? Did they
			in fact provide their colony's
			assailants with something that
			abetted the total destruction of
			Rana Four in order to protect
			their own lives?
			What could two botanists in their
			eighties possess that could
			possibly aid whoever attacked this
			planet?
			We have no idea what the enemy
			needed, Doctor. Love, fear, hope
			-- a cup of tea. It is a strange
			universe we live in.
			Maybe they're being held hostage
			in some fashion.
			Nothing in the tricorder readings
			indicated emotional stress.
			Counselor... ?
			Counselor Troi... ?
			I'm sorry... I can't sense them
			well enough...
			Specimens...
			Maybe they've been preserved as
			specimens... pets... trophies...
			exhibits in a zoo...
			No. The assailants would have
			picked someone younger for that,
			someone who would have given them
			a proper show for their money.
			Number One, you say the couple
			is incapable of sustaining
			themselves?
			There's a fusion reactor in the
			house, probably good for another
			five years of power. But their
			watertable is tainted and they
			have no way of feeding themselves
			other than a small garden.
			They won't come to the ship?
			They were adamant.
			We'll do all that we can to help
			them... but in the meantime I want
			them kept under surveillance.
			Counselor, is something wrong?
			I'm sorry... I don't feel well.
			I would like to go to my
			quarters...
			By all means.
			Is there anything I can do?
			Captain, a search of the Ranian
			system has determined that the
			hostile force that attacked this
			planet is no longer present.
			I remember a Starfleet admiral
			saying the same thing about some
			renegade Andorians in the
			Triangulum system once. The truth
			was they'd dismantled their ship
			and hidden it.
			Those Andorians did not have to
			contend with someone of my
			thoroughness. I will stake my
			reputation.
			Don't listen... think of something
			else...
			Stop... please stop!
			Yes --
			I was concerned. I came to see
			if I could be of any help.
			I'm fine. There's nothing wrong.
			I'm tired, that's all.
			I don't have your gift for reading
			emotions, Counselor, but I can
			tell when someone is in pain and
			hiding it.
			It's silly... I... I hear music.
			Music that won't stop. In my
			mind.
			Perhaps it's a symptom of
			fatigue. We've all been inflicted
			one time or another with the song
			that wouldn't quit.
			No... it's deeper than that. The
			song never stops for an instant.
			It plays in perfect clarity from
			beginning to end over and over
			again.
			I don't even know what song it
			is -- I've never heard it before!
			When did this start?
			A few hours ago. While the away
			team was on the surface. I was
			trying to... I was thinking of
			Rishon and Kevin...
			Rishon and Kevin... And?
			I can't explain. They're elusive.
			They're... I'm sorry...
			Get some rest. Take the necessary
			sleep inducements if you have to.
			Data, give us a visual.
			Magnfication factor fifty.
			Where did that come from?
			Apparently it was riding a
			Lagrange point behind Rana
			Four's furthest moon.
			Our vehicle classification index
			can put no identity to it. Its
			design is completely foreign.
			But it's our boy -- roughly five
			times our mass and carrying enough
			armament to pulverize a planet.
			Lieutenant Worf... ?
			I... cannot explain this, Captain.
			It's moving toward the planet.
			Open a hailing frequency, Data.
			Ask them to identify themselves
			and to match orbit with us.
			They have received the message,
			Captain, but are chosing to ignore
			it.
			Worf, maximum shields, ready all
			weapon systems.
			Aye, sir.
			It's assuming an attack posture.
			Don't be surprised if --
			The vessel is firing jacketed
			streams of positrons and
			antiprotons, equivalent firepower
			of forty megawatts. Shields are
			holding.
			Again forty megawatts. No damage.
			If that's as good as they can do,
			this'll be over in five minutes.
			Worf, fire phasers... Just a
			warning shot. Data, repeat the
			order to stand to.
			The vessel has assumed a course
			out of the Rana system and is
			rapidly increasing velocity.
			Helm, initiate pursuit.
			Aye, sir.
			The vessel has reached warp two
			and continues on a steady
			acceleration curve. We aren't
			getting any closer, Commander.
			Give us a superior curve, Mister
			Crusher.
			Warp three... warp four... The
			warship is simultaneously matching
			our curve point per point. Warp
			four point five... warp five...
			warp five point five...
			Riker to La Forge. Give us
			everything you can to close the
			gap, Geordi.
			Yes, sir. I'll get you to
			Nine point three seven in fifteen
			seconds.
			Warp eight point five... warp
			eight point seven five... warp
			nine... the warship continues to
			match our acceleration curve
			perfectly.
			I get the impression we're being
			toyed with, Number One.
			This ship will not chase a pony
			on a merry-go-round. Number One,
			take us back to Rana Four.
			Back?
			We have unfinished business
			there. I need to have a talk with
			those two people.
			Reduce speed. Bring us around
			on a return course.
			This one's getting away...
			Good afternoon. I apologize if
			I startled you. I'm Jean-Luc
			Picard, captain of the Enterprise.
			I've brought you something you
			badly need if you're going to stay
			on Rana -- a matter replicator.
			It has limited capabilities, but...
			Thank you. But we have no use
			for such a thing.
			It will provide you with food
			and clothing -- clean water.
			Lieutenant Worf can instruct you
			in its operation.
			We don't need it.
			Kevin, you know we do.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Kevin and I were about to have
			our afternoon tea. You and Mister
			Worf must stay and have some with
			us.
			We'd like that very much.
			Rishon, they only want to spy on
			us like this morning.
			Kevin, I've never turned away a
			visitor to this house and I'm not
			starting today.
			Please come in, both of you. And
			excuse the mess...
			Stop -- make it stop! Please,
			I'll do anything -- make it stop!
			Deanna, please. I'm here to help.
			It's getting louder! So loud...
			I can't stand it -- make it stop!
			Move her to the bed.
			This will relax you.
			I hear it! It's still there!
			It's so loud --
			Move her to Sickbay.
			No! I want to stay in my
			quarters.
			I can get you to sleep there.
			I don't want to sleep! The music
			will only follow me!
			I can induce delta sleep... Tune
			out even your deepest dreams.
			But it's not a dream! You've got
			to understand that! It's not a
			dream -- it's real!
			Kevin and I first saw each other
			on a ship at sea. He was a
			starving student in a threadbare
			suit and mismatched shoes. I was
			traveling with my parents who
			didn't like the way he was hanging
			around. I asked him to marry me
			two hours after we met and he knew
			I was serious. I don't think he's
			ever recovered from that day.
			Mister Worf, what do you think?
			Good tea. Nice house.
			Why did you leave Earth and move
			to a brand new world when you did?
			You mean at our age? We thought
			it would make us fall in love all
			over again.
			It worked.
			It must've been terrible... when
			the colony was fighting for its
			life.
			Yes, it was. Fire lit the sky...
			the ground never stopped
			shaking... there was thunder,
			unbelievable thunder...
			But you survived...
			We don't know why we did and the
			others didn't. I've tried to put
			some purpose to it, but I can't.
			I was wondering, Captain, when
			you and your ship would be
			leaving...
			I don't have an answer for that.
			A few hours ago we had an
			encounter with a warship...
			Possibly the one which attacked
			you. We forced it to leave the
			system but were unable to affect
			it otherwise. It could return.
			Kevin -- you said it'd gone away.
			I guess I was wrong. Don't worry.
			It didn't hurt us before, it won't
			hurt us now.
			Do you know that for a fact,
			Kevin?
			No. But I don't enjoy seeing my
			wife frightened. As we've told
			you time and time again, Captain,
			we don't know why we were spared.
			But there had to have been a
			reason. In some way you and
			Rishon were "different" from the
			other colonists. Your
			geographical location, your
			philosophical beliefs, the color
			of your eyes -- somehow you stood
			apart from them.
			There was a difference... I am
			a man of special conscience.
			While the others were doing what
			they could, I chose not to fight.
			That is your protected right.
			But I assure you the attacking
			ship had no way of realizing this.
			I expected to die like all the
			others.
			There's no reason for you and your
			ship to remain, Captain. We can
			manage without you.
			Kevin grieved for the others but
			he did nothing. He's a very
			gentle man. Please understand
			that.
			What about you, Rishon? Did you
			feel the same way?
			I wanted to fight... but I stayed
			with my husband. Thank you again
			for the replicator, Captain. I
			had better clean up now...
			Before we go I ask you one more
			time to come to the ship. For
			your own safety.
			I'm frightened, Captain. But I
			can't leave Rana. Even if it
			means my life.
			I don't understand it. I've
			inhibited almost all the activity
			of the neocortex and she
			continues to behave as if she's
			hearing the music...
			We're going to have to shield
			her from all outside stimuli by
			inducing coma...
			I have positive identification,
			Commander. It is the vessel that
			attacked us earlier. It is
			reentering the system at high
			velocity and is approaching
			Rana Four.
			Give us a tight visual, Data.
			Is it my imagination or does it
			look a lot meaner this time?
			Shields up. Weapons ready.
			Our friend is back.
			I am not surprised. Lieutenant
			Worf, open a hailing frequency.
			Warn the vessel to stay clear of
			the planet.
			Aye, sir. But they are already
			within firing range.
			Shields down! Captain, they hit
			us with four hundred gigawatts
			of particle energy!
			Damage?
			Superficial -- but I am having
			trouble reassembling the shields!
			Shields down! There is thermal
			damage to the hull!
			The warship is in possession of
			enormous energy reserves. It is
			capable of striking us with
			far more powerful bursts.
			They're maneuvering to come
			between the Enterprise and Rana
			Four.
			Number One, we have been exemplary
			in our patience.
			Lieutenant Worf, fire phasers on
			full with a simultaneous spread
			of torpedoes.
			The vessel appears undamaged.
			Its defenses are apparently able
			to absorb incoming matter and
			energy.
			Commence rapid fire with all
			weapons on full!
			Shields are down! There is
			internal damage -- weapon systems
			control has been lost!
			Riker to Sickbay. Medical
			assistance to the bridge!
			Mister Crusher, move the
			Enterprise out of range of the
			attacking vessel!
			The vessel has terminated its
			pursuit. It is assuming an orbit
			around Rana Four.
			Rishon and Kevin...
			We can't help them... But it's
			my guess they're in no danger.
			Number of casualties?
			Sixty-six.
			Fatalities?
			None. We've been able to treat
			everyone.
			Can you help her?
			I've done everything I can. I
			don't understand the nature of
			this music she says she's hearing,
			or where it's coming from.
			Could it be telepathic?
			Yes. But I'm no expert at
			determining that.
			They're blocking her sensitivity
			... keeping her from "seeing"
			the truth.
			Who?
			Rishon and Kevin.
			What?
			They wanted us to leave Rana...
			and that's exactly what we're
			doing.
			Picard to bridge.
			Yes, Captain.
			Number One, I want you to maintain
			the present course for another
			hour, then turn the Enterprise
			around and take it back to Rana
			Four.
			Sir? We still won't have our
			shields restored by then.
			We're going back, Commander --
			and this time nothing is going
			to lure us away.
			Sensors indicate no spacecraft
			in the vicinity of Rana Four.
			But Captain --
			Forget your previous error,
			Lieutenant. There was no way
			you could have prevented it.
			Captain, the Uxbridge house is
			coming into transporter range.
			Lieutenant Worf. If you will
			accompany me to the Transporter
			Room...
			I think you should reconsider
			this, Captain. The warship has
			come after us twice, it could come
			back.
			I disagree, Commander. I don't
			think it knows we're here. I
			think it believes it's run us off
			for good. That, however, will
			change once I'm back on board.
			Sir?
			It's protecting Rishon and Kevin.
			It responds to their wishes --
			directly or indirectly, I'm not
			sure. That's what I'm going to
			put to the test.
			Celebrating?
			What are you doing here? What
			do you want?
			This is the second time you've
			shown surprise at my appearance,
			Kevin. The first time was
			understandable, but why now? --
			unless you expected never to see
			me again.
			Why do you keep interfering with
			our lives, Captain?
			It isn't my intention to
			interfere, Kevin... only to help
			you and Rishon.
			Then please leave us alone.
			I promise you that once I leave
			this house I will never set foot
			in it again. The Enterprise,
			however, will remain in orbit over
			this planet.
			Why?
			To protect you.
			That isn't necessary, Captain.
			I thought you understood.
			But it is necessary, Kevin. Your
			lives are in great danger. The
			warship has returned.
			Kevin --
			He's lying, Rishon.
			We fought a pitched battle with
			it and lost. Many of my crew have
			been injured -- including a woman
			who's mind is slowly being
			destroyed by a telepathic
			aberration.
			No! Oh please no!
			This is a form of intimidation.
			I have my rights --
			You, Kevin? What about Rishon?
			Is she in favor of being left
			at the mercy of a homicidal
			spaceship?
			I think you'd better go,
			Captain...
			Come to the Enterprise, Rishon.
			Let me take you where you'll be
			safe.
			No. I can't leave Kevin...
			And I'm staying. She's safe here
			with me in this house.
			Then explain to me why you're
			safe, Kevin. Why is this house
			a sanctuary from a destructive
			force that otherwise has no
			conscience? Does it have to do
			with you -- with your refusal to
			fight?
			Tell me this, Kevin. If Rishon
			were in danger, would you kill
			to save her life?
			No! Not for her, not for anyone!
			I will not kill!
			Stop hurting him! Leave our
			house!
			It is my sworn duty to protect
			you. The Enterprise will remain
			in orbit around Rana Four as
			long as the two of you are alive.
			Number One -- an update, please.
			Little change, Captain. The
			shields are still inoperable.
			We have partial control of our
			weapons. I've doubled the repair
			crews.
			Commander. The warship is
			approaching from high orbit. It
			is very close -- three hundred
			thousand kilometers distance.
			How is that possible? Is
			something wrong with the sensors?
			That's of no concern, Number One.
			It's here. And precisely on
			schedule.
			The vessel has altered its course
			to a direct intercept with the
			Enterprise.
			Worf, arm phasers and photon
			torpedos, prepare to fire.
			Belay those orders, Mister Worf.
			The vessel is now within twenty
			thousand kilometers of the
			Enterprise and closing.
			Let it come, Commander. Activate
			the Main Viewer.
			Evasive action, sir?
			The Enterprise will stand its
			ground, Lieutenant.
			Weapons, sir?
			When I give the order. Not
			before.
			The vessel is entering a low
			orbit around Rana Four.
			Captain, it appears it is
			preparing to fire at the planet.
			Understood.
			My calculations indicate that its
			target may be the house of Rishon
			and Kevin Uxbridge.
			There will be no interference from
			us, Mister Data.
			The house has been obliterated!
			Scan for survivors, Lieutenant.
			There are no survivors.
			Ready a photon torpedo. Fire at
			the vessel when ready.
			Aye, sir.
			Commander Riker. What reason does
			the Enterprise have to remain at
			Rana?
			The unknown vessel has been
			destroyed. The Uxbridges have
			been destroyed. There is no
			reason for the Enterprise to
			remain.
			Good. Helm, move us to a higher
			orbit so that we may keep the
			surface of the planet under
			surveillance.
			Aye, sir. But, Captain, what do
			we watch for?
			Anything. If I'm needed I will
			be in my Ready Room. That is all
			for now.
			Come.
			Captain, may I speak with you?
			The pleasure is mine, Number One.
			We've been observing the planet
			very carefully for three hours.
			We've seen nothing. I have the
			feeling you're waiting for
			something to happen.
			I have acted on an assumption,
			Commander. I am not sure what
			the result will be -- or even that
			my assumption is correct.
			We found two people alive in a
			house on a devastated planet.
			But there was only one survivor
			of the war on Rana Four
			Why is it we maintain watch on
			a planet that is now totally dead?
			Bridge to Captain Picard. You
			had better come see this.
			Captain, Commander, it's back --
			the house! And the trees and the
			grass! It happened right in
			front of us.
			Worf, do you see survivors?
			I detect two life-forms inside the
			house. It appears Kevin and
			Rishon were not destroyed. But
			how... ?
			Helm, bring us into transporter
			range. I want them beamed aboard
			-- directly to the bridge.
			Captain, will they not protest?
			Let them.
			My apologies if I interrupted a
			waltz...
			Why have you brought us here
			against our will?
			To end the suffering of one of
			my crewmembers.
			I don't understand --
			Kevin does. He's the cause.
			At first I couldn't figure out
			why your house had survived the
			holocaust while all the others
			hadn't. And then it occurred
			to me that it had been destroyed.
			The dwelling where you served me
			tea and danced your waltzes was
			a reproduction, something real
			to the touch but capable of being
			created and destroyed and
			recreated at whim.
			Now you're joking with us,
			Captain. Can't you see it's
			hurting my husband?
			Rishon... hear what he has to say.
			More than anything, you wanted
			the Enterprise away from Rana.
			Why?
			Because the house, the plot of
			land, your very own existence,
			were riddles you were helpless
			to explain. The warship --
			another recreation -- twice tried
			to chase us away but failed.
			When I came to the house a second
			time I provided you with the only
			condition that would make the
			Enterprise leave -- your deaths
			-- and you did your best to
			satisfy me.
			I am deeply sorry about the
			woman. I will help her. But
			I must know what you intend to
			do with me afterwards...
			Take you to the nearest starbase
			where you will be held accountable
			for the attack on this ship...
			and perhaps the deaths of eleven
			thousand people.
			No! He hasn't killed anyone!
			The destruction of the planet
			happened just as I told you.
			But you haven't told us the whole
			story, Kevin -- how it ended...
			the part about Rishon.
			What is he saying... ?
			I can touch you, Rishon. Hear
			your voice. Smell your perfume.
			In every respect you are a real
			person with your own mind and your
			own beliefs... but you do not
			exist. You died with the others,
			defending the colony. He has
			recreated you just as he has
			recreated the house.
			You're the only living thing that
			really exists on Rana Four,
			Kevin. And though you look
			human, you're not.
			He's in the turbolift!
			Let him go.
			Captain -- he is dangerous!
			So dangerous, Lieutenant, he could
			have destroyed us at any instant
			he wished. Track him. Alert the
			crew to keep out of his way. I
			want him to know we mean him no
			harm...
			Will he try to get back to the
			planet?
			Not if he's the creature of
			conscience I think he is. He has
			someone to help first...
			I have taken the music from her
			mind. She's alright now. She's
			sleeping.
			She was beginning to sense who
			I really was. I've been living
			as a human for over fifty years
			but I couldn't hide from her.
			She has suffered because of my
			pride and selfishness. It will
			not happen again.
			What happened on Rana Four,
			Kevin? The truth this time --
			all of it.
			Very well. For what it's worth.
			I am a Douwd... an immortal being
			of disguises and false
			surroundings. I have lived in
			this galaxy for many thousands
			of years although until today no
			one has known my true identity.
			Once while traveling in human
			form I chanced to fall in love
			with an Earth woman. I put aside
			my powers and became her husband.
			Our life was happy and rich.
			Eventually we came to this planet
			to live our final years. Now she
			is dead. She never knew what I
			really was...
			Your colony was attacked by a
			warship...
			Belonging to the Husnock, a
			species of hideous intelligence
			that knew only aggression and
			destruction. I could have
			destroyed them with a mere
			thought, but this I did not do.
			You had the power to stop them
			and you didn't?
			I refused to for the same reason
			I refused to stop the Enterprise.
			I will not kill!
			So you let the colonists fight
			a hopeless battle.
			I tried to fool the Husnock as
			I tried to fool you, but it only
			made them angrier and more cruel.
			And then what you feared most
			happened. Rishon went to fight
			with the others -- and she died
			with them.
			How I wish I could have died with
			her...
			But you couldn't. You did the
			unthinkable instead. You took
			revenge.
			Yes! I saw her broken body. I
			went insane! My hatred exploded
			and in an instant of grief I
			destroyed the Husnock!
			Why did you try to hide this from
			us? Was it out of guilt for not
			helping Rishon and the others when
			they were alive?
			No. You don't understand the
			scope of my crime. I didn't kill
			just one Husnock, or a hundred,
			or a thousand -- I killed them
			all. All! The mothers, the
			babies, all the Husnock
			everywhere!
			Are eleven thousand people worth
			fifty billion? Is the love of
			a woman worth the destruction of
			an entire species... ? This is
			the sin I tried so hard to keep
			you from learning. This is why
			I wanted to chase you from Rana.
			We are not qualified to be your
			judges. We have no law to fit
			your crime. You're free to return
			to the planet... and to make
			Rishon live again.
			Helm... break orbit. Full
			impulse.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43043.5.
			We are departing the Rana
			system for Starbase
			one three three. We leave behind
			a being of extraordinary power...
			and conscience. I am not certain
			if he should be praised or
			condemned. Only that he should
			be left alone...
