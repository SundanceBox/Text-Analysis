			Captain's log, Stardate 43657.0
			We have arrived at sector four-eight-seven
			to begin charting this
			region of the galaxy. Commander
			Riker has been spared this
			sometimes tedious duty by virtue
			of a long overdue personal leave.
			Did he send for you too?
			Yes... he was very mysterious
			about it.
			Does anyone have any idea what
			this is all about?
			Something happened at that
			cybernetics conference. Since
			he's come back he's spent every
			off duty minute in that lab.
			It is very unlike Data to be
			secretive.
			And cautious. He kept the lab
			locked.
			Now how would you know that?
			Oh, you are early. Just a moment
			please.
			You may enter now.
			C'mon, Data, what is this...
			Yeah, what's going on?
			I have invited you here to meet
			someone.
			This is Lal. Lal, say hello to
			Counselor Deanna Troi...
			Hello... Counselor Deanna Troi...
			How do you do, Lal.
			I am functioning... within normal
			parameters.
			And this is Geordi La Forge and
			Wesley Crusher.
			Purpose for... exterior drapings,
			Father?
			Father?
			It is the custom that we wear
			clothing.
			It called you "Father", Data.
			Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child.
			It has a positronic brain... one
			very similar to my own... I began
			to program it at the cybernetics
			conference...
			But nobody's ever been able to
			do that... at least not since you
			were programmed Data...
			There was a new submicron matrix-transfer
			technology introduced
			at the conference which I
			discovered could be used to lay
			down complex neural net
			pathways...
			You mean a transfer... from your
			your brain to Lal's...
			Exactly, Wesley. I realized for
			the very first time it was possible
			to continue Doctor Soong's work.
			My initial transfers have produced
			very encouraging results... so I
			brought Lal's brain back with me
			to continue.
			Data...
			I would like to have been
			consulted.
			I have not observed anyone else
			on board consult with you about
			their procreation, Captain.
			No, but...
			... in your case... it's not quite
			the same.
			The intention is the same.
			Lal's creation is entirely
			dependent on me. I am giving it
			knowledge and skills that are
			stored in my brain... its
			programming reflects mine in the
			same way a human child's genes
			reflect its parent's genes...
			It's true, Captain, this
			technology requires another
			positronic brain that's fully
			programmed...
			And Data's the only person around
			who has one. That does kind of
			makes him Lal's dad.
			Of course, it is not complete.
			We have only made two transfers.
			Why didn't you give it a more
			human look, Data?
			I decided to allow Lal to choose
			its own appearance and sex.
			Mister Data, at your convenience,
			I'd like to talk to you in my
			Ready Room. Counselor...
			Captain... Have a cigar.
			I believe it is customary.
			I would suggest we do whatever
			we can to discourage this
			perception of the new android as
			a "child"...
			Counselor, it is not a child.
			It is an invention, albeit an
			extraordinary one.
			Why should biology or technology
			determine whether it is a child?
			I see a man who has created an
			offspring... a new life out of
			his own being. That suggests a
			child to me. If Data wishes to
			call Lal his child, who are we to
			argue?
			If he must, fine. But I don't
			understand how he can call a five
			foot android, with heuristic
			learning systems and the strength
			of a ten men a "child".
			You've never been a parent.
			Data, what you have done has very
			serious ramifications and I am
			dismayed that you did not inform
			anyone of what you were doing.
			I am sorry I did not anticipate
			your objections, Captain. Do you
			wish me to deactivate Lal?
			It is a life, Data. It cannot
			be activated or de-activated
			simply. It is a stupendous
			undertaking. Have you any idea
			what will happen when Starfleet
			learns of this?
			I have followed all Starfleet
			regulations to the best of my
			ability, Captain... I expected
			they would be pleased...
			We'll see.
			My foremost concern is for the
			safety of this ship and crew.
			You are faster, stronger, and far
			more knowledgeable than any
			human...
			I can assure you Lal's programming
			includes psychological inhibitor
			safeguards to prevent any threat
			to the Enterprise.
			And in the event of a malfunction?
			A malfunction is of course a
			possibility, Captain. But Lal's
			program is equipped like mine --
			it will shut down before
			deleterious behavior can begin.
			You've taken on quite a
			responsibility, Mister Data...
			To prepare, I have scanned all
			the available literature on
			parenting. There seems to be much
			confusion on the issue. One
			traditional doctrine insists
			"spare the rod and spoil the
			child", suggesting a punitive
			approach... another more liberal
			attitude would allow a child
			enormous freedom...
			Data...
			And what the Klingons do to their
			children...
			I'm not talking about parenting.
			I'm talking about the
			extraordinary consequences of
			creating new life.
			Does that not describe becoming
			a parent, sir?
			You are seeking to achieve what
			no one, other than your own
			creator, has been able to achieve
			-- to make another sentient,
			functional android. To make
			another Data.
			That is why I must attempt this,
			Captain. I have observed that
			in most species, there is a primal
			instinct to perpetuate themselves.
			And while I have not been
			programmed with instinctive
			behavior patterns, I do understand
			that I have been, until now, the
			last of my kind. If I were damaged
			or destroyed, I would be lost
			forever. But if I am successful
			with the creation of Lal, my
			continuance is assured. I believe
			I understand the consequences. And
			I am prepared to accept the
			responsibility.
			Gender female.
			That's right, Lal. Just like me.
			Gender male.
			Correct.
			I am... gender neuter.
			Inadequate.
			That is why you must choose a
			gender, Lal. And complete your
			appearance.
			What are... criteria?
			Access your data bank on
			sexuality, level two. That will
			define the parameters.
			Whatever you choose will be yours
			for your lifetime, Lal... It is
			a decision that will affect how
			people interrelate with you.
			I choose... your sex... and
			appearance.
			No, Lal... that would be
			confusing. We are taking you to
			the Holodeck to show you several
			thousand composites which I have
			programmed. You may choose from
			them.
			Several thousand... ?
			This is a big decision...
			Counselor...
			Lal has narrowed the choices to
			four... would you like to see?
			Yes... yes, of course, Data...
			Computer, Lal -- gender sequence
			finalists... begin...
			An Andorian female...
			Interesting. You'd be the only
			one on board the Enterprise,
			Lal...
			That could make socialization more
			difficult.
			A human male...
			Very attractive... no problem with
			socialization here...
			The human female.
			I like her.
			A Klingon male.
			A friend for Worf.
			They are all very interesting,
			Lal. Do you have a favorite?
			Yes. I have... chosen.
			Come in, Counselor. I have
			completed the assembly of the
			replicated anatomy. I was able
			to provide Lal with even more
			realistic skin and eye color than
			my own.
			Congratulations, Data, it's a
			girl.
			This is home.
			Home. Place of residence. Social
			unit formed by a family living
			together.
			Correct, Lal. We are a family.
			A chair... to sit in.
			A painting.
			Painting. Colors produced on a
			surface by applying a pigment.
			I will teach you how to recognize
			the artistry of paintings.
			Soft.
			Yes, very good, Lal. You have
			correctly processed the sense of
			touch.
			There are many fascinating
			experiences I wish to share with
			you.
			Painting.
			No, Lal, this is a flower.
			Inhale.
			Smell.
			Yes.
			Show me more, Father.
			Second officer, science log
			supplemental, copy: Starfleet
			research, Daystrom Institute,
			Galor Four annex. Reference:
			development, android designate
			Lal.
			Training in social skills at the
			most elementary level has begun.
			Lal is progressing very slowly
			but is not deterred by early
			setbacks.
			Motor coordination has improved
			by twelve-point-four percent...
			this reflects the adaptation of
			second level neural transfers...
			Reflexes still need to develop.
			The integration of hand/eye
			coordination seems to be
			proceeding at a slower
			developmental rate.
			Visual comprehension is especially
			difficult for Lal. Translating
			her vast data banks into
			recognizable applications may
			improve with additional transfers.
			She is also learning to supplement
			innate android behavior with human
			responses.
			Most encouraging is her commitment
			to master the skills necessary
			to live successfully among humans.
			Her curiosity is insatiable...
			although it sometimes creates
			inappropriate behavior...
			And I have been interested to note
			that as I observe Lal learning
			about her world... I share in her
			experience, almost as though I
			am learning things over again...
			The transfer itself is fairly
			simple.
			Each neural pathway in my brain
			has been duplicated precisely in
			hers...
			One advantage of a brain like
			yours, Data is that we can
			replicate it.
			Theoretically, the duplicate
			brains should be able to store
			and process the same
			information... but until all the
			transfers are complete, we will
			not know for certain.
			What does Lal do while you're on
			duty?
			She studies in our quarters. She
			does not require much supervision,
			Wesley. Lal is quite
			self-sufficient.
			You could send her to school.
			Lal already has access to the sum
			of human knowledge.
			There are a lot of things you can
			learn just by being with kids your
			own age, Data.
			She is only two weeks old.
			Well, closer to her own age.
			Doctor Crusher to Ensign Crusher.
			Aren't you supposed to be getting
			a hair cut, Wesley?
			Yes, Mom. I'm on my way.
			Parents.
			Nothing personal.
			Lal, the third crosslink transfer
			series is complete.
			Father, what is my purpose?
			Purpose?
			My function, my reason for being?
			It is a complex question, Lal.
			I can only begin to answer it by
			telling you that our function is
			to contribute in a positive way
			to the world in which we live.
			Why am I me instead of someone
			else?
			Because you are my child.
			Where did I come from?
			Your questions suggest we have
			made a successful transfer of the
			heuristic associative pathways.
			You will now begin to process
			information on logic, aesthetics,
			metaphysics, and epistemology.
			You are truly becoming sentient,
			Lal.
			How?
			By developing the awareness to
			examine and question your
			perceptions.
			Why do we have two hands... why
			not three or four... Why is the
			sky black... why do...
			Lal, did you know that tomorrow
			will be your first day of school?
			I assure you, Admiral, there's no
			better guide into this life for Lal
			than Data... He's doing an
			excellent job with her...
			We all have enormous admiration
			for what Commander Data has
			achieved already. But we have
			superior facilities and personnel
			here at Galor Four. And a
			starship is hardly a proper
			setting...
			This starship's mission is to
			seek out new life and that is what
			Commander Data is doing. Under my
			direction.
			We only want what's best for the
			new android.
			As do I.
			I would be willing to consider
			releasing Lal and Data to join
			you... so he may continue his work
			with her.
			I anticipated this suggestion.
			Frankly, as extraordinary as he
			is, Data's an imperfect role
			model. In many ways, he's still
			developing.
			Aren't we all, Admiral...
			His presence would undoubtedly
			retard the the new android's
			progress.
			Admiral, to you Lal is a new
			android. But to Data, she is his
			child.
			His child.
			Yes, Admiral. It may not be easy
			for you and I to see her that way.
			But he does. And I respect that.
			They will remain here for now.
			Starfleet's policy on research
			is clear... you're making your
			stand on very uncertain ground...
			I do hope it doesn't fall out from
			under you... Haftel out.
			She achieved a very high score
			on a test of academic
			achievement...
			A perfect score.
			Yes. Which is why we started her
			with the older children. But Lal
			couldn't understand the nuances
			of how they related to each other.
			I see.
			We decided the best thing to do
			would be to put her with younger
			children.
			That would seem to be reasonable.
			It isn't working out that way.
			The children are afraid of her.
			Father, what is the significance
			of laughter?
			It is a human physiological
			response to humor.
			Then judging from their laughter
			the children at school found my
			remarks humorous.
			So without understanding humor
			I have somehow mastered it.
			Deck fifteen.
			Lal...
			Yes, Father?
			The children were not laughing
			with you... they were laughing
			at you.
			Explain.
			One is meant kindly... the other
			is not.
			Why did they wish to be unkind?
			Because you are different. And
			sometimes differences scare
			people. I have learned that some
			of them use humor to hide their
			fears.
			I do not want to be different,
			Father.
			Doctor, I require your advice as
			a successful parent.
			Well, thank you, Data. I'd like
			to think I am. Sit down. How's
			Lal?
			Lal is realizing that she is not
			the same as the other children.
			Is it lonely for her?
			She does not feel the emotion of
			loneliness, but she can observe
			how isolated she is from the
			others. She wants to be more like
			them.
			Sounds familiar.
			Yes, Doctor. It is an experience
			I know too well. But I do not
			know how to help her. Lal is
			passing into sentience. It is
			perhaps the most difficult stage
			of development for her.
			It's also a very human
			development, Data. As our minds
			and bodies grow, sometimes
			quite rapidly, we get confused
			too... we look around and try to
			see how we fit in...
			When Wesley was growing up, he
			was an extraordinarily bright
			boy... but he had a hard time
			making friends. The other
			children were a little intimidated
			by him.
			That is precisely what happened
			to Lal at school. How did you
			help him?
			Well, first I had to go back into
			my own childhood and remember how
			painful it was for me. Because
			there was a time when I didn't
			feel very popular either. When
			I told that to Wesley, it made
			him feel a little better. He knew
			I understood what he was going
			through.
			I have not told Lal how difficult
			it was for me to assimilate. I
			did not want it to discourage her.
			Perhaps this was an error of
			judgement.
			You had no one with experience
			to help you through sentience.
			At least, she has you. Just help
			her realize that she's not alone.
			Be there to nurture her when she
			needs love and attention.
			I can give her attention, doctor.
			But I am incapable of giving her
			love.
			Why do I find that so hard to
			believe?
			Captain, incoming signal.
			Starfleet priority one. Admiral
			Haftel.
			On my monitor, Lieutenant.
			Admiral.
			Captain, I hope I didn't disturb
			you.
			Not at all.
			I've discussed my concerns with
			Starfleet Command. You are to
			hold your position until I join
			you. Then I shall personally
			review the android's development.
			Understood.
			Good. I should advise you,
			Captain, that if I am not
			satisfied with what I see... I
			am empowered to take the android
			back with me. Haftel out.
			Captain's log, supplemental: We
			are holding position pending the
			arrival of Admiral Haftel from
			Starfleet Research.
			Commander Data is completing his
			final neural transfers to the
			android he has named Lal... Which
			I have learned, in the language
			of Hindi, means "beloved".
			Hello, Commander. Lal, how are
			you?
			I am functioning within normal
			--
			I am fine, thank you...
			Guinan, Lal needs to observe human
			behavior.
			You've come to the right place,
			Lal. There are all sorts of human
			behavior in here.
			In return for this opportunity,
			Lal is willing to provide services
			to assist you.
			Sort of a work-study program...
			Father says I would learn a great
			deal from working with someone
			as old as you.
			I believe what I said was that
			Guinan had much life experience,
			Lal...
			No, the exact words you used
			were...
			You're hired. The most important
			part of this job is listening...
			People need a friendly ear to talk
			to... Happens to be my
			specialty... There's an art to it
			and I'll teach it to you, Lal.
			That would be very beneficial.
			How much do you know about food
			and beverages?
			I've been programmed with a
			listing of fourteen hundred and
			twelve known beverages as well
			as recipes for...
			What'd did you just say...
			I've been programmed with...
			"I've"... ?
			Lal, you used a verbal
			contraction.
			You said I've instead of I have.
			It is a skill my program has never
			mastered.
			Then I will desist.
			No. You have exceeded my
			abilities. I do not object. I
			just do not understand why it has
			happened.
			Picard to Data. Please report
			to my Ready Room.
			Yes, Captain.
			I am sure the admiral is anxious
			to meet Lal... I have been sending
			him regular status reports on her
			development...
			His visit, Data, is not just an
			inspection of Lal's progress.
			He has expressed a concern for
			her environment.
			Her environment, sir?
			He believes the Daystrom annex
			on Galor Four would be more
			suitable.
			He wishes to relocate us?
			Not you, Data. Just Lal.
			I would not be in favor of that,
			Captain.
			There are many things she can
			learn only from me. My lifetime
			of experiences, the mistakes I
			have made and what I have learned
			from them...
			Captain, Commander Riker's shuttle
			has just returned.
			Acknowledged, Lieutenant. Advise
			Mister Riker I'll want to meet
			with him in one hour. Picard
			out.
			The admiral is taking the position
			that Lal's development should be
			overseen by the most experienced
			personnel available.
			Then he is questioning my ability
			as a parent.
			In a manner of speaking...
			Does the admiral have children,
			sir?
			I believe he does... why?
			I am forced to wonder how much
			experience he had as a parent when
			his first child was born.
			There, you see?
			Visual reconnaissance.
			It's called flirting.
			They seem to be communicating
			telepathically.
			Well, they're both thinking the
			same thing if that's what you
			mean.
			Guinan, is the joining of hands
			a symbolic act for humans?
			It shows affection. Humans like
			to touch each other. They start
			with the hands and move on from
			there.
			He's biting that female.
			No, they're touching lips.
			Kissing.
			Why are they leaving?
			Lal, there are some things your
			dad'll have to tell you... when
			he thinks you're ready.
			You're new around here, aren't
			you?
			Yes.
			Lal, put him down...
			Commander, what are your
			intentions toward my daughter?
			I'm not... what... who... your
			daughter?
			Nice to meet'cha...
			I watch them and I can do the
			things they do... but I'll never
			feel the emotions. I'll never
			know love.
			That is a limitation we must
			learn to accept, Lal.
			Then why do you still try to
			emulate humans? What purpose
			does it serve except to remind
			you that you are incomplete?
			I have asked myself that many
			times as I have struggled to be
			more human, Lal. Until I finally
			realized that it is the struggle
			itself that is most important.
			We must strive to be better than
			we are. It does not matter that
			we will never reach our ultimate
			goal. The effort yields its own
			rewards.
			You are wise, Father.
			It is only the difference between
			knowledge and experience.
			I learned today that humans like
			to hold hands. It is a symbolic
			gesture of affection.
			Prepare to beam me aboard,
			Captain.
			No objective viewpoint could see
			it any other way...
			I beg your pardon, Admiral, but
			I thought you were sent here to
			form an opinion... not to justify
			one.
			Captain, do not make this more
			difficult than it needs to be.
			It need not be difficult at all.
			I understand your concerns. What
			I'm asking for is time, patience.
			If you keep an open mind, I know
			you'll see it is imperative to
			keep Data and Lal together. At
			least for the formative stages
			of her development. After that,
			I'm sure that Commander Data will
			be delighted to deliver her to
			Starfleet Research.
			Not satisfactory. If mistakes
			are made during the formative
			stages, the damage might be
			irreparable.
			I'm convinced the damage would
			be irreparable if you separate
			them.
			Really, Captain... is this about
			breaking up a family... Rather
			a sentimental attitude to take
			toward androids, isn't it?
			They are living, sentient beings.
			Their rights and privileges in
			our society have been defined.
			I helped define them.
			Yes, yes... I'm more than willing
			to acknowledge that. And you must
			acknowledge that Lal may be a
			technological step forward in the
			development of artificial
			intelligence.
			A most significant step.
			And work like this demands
			strictly controlled procedures.
			Which Commander Data is following.
			In effective isolation. And that
			is unacceptable to Starfleet
			Research.
			This is not personal, Captain.
			There are very real dangers here.
			Without peer review, Starfleet
			feels we're risking another M-5
			catastrophe.
			That is a forced parallel, Admiral.
			M-5 was a battle computer.
			With an artificial intelligence,
			that led to disaster.
			Does this new android have the
			same dangerous potential? I don't
			know. And that is my point. The
			blame of the M-5 catastrophe can
			be laid entirely on the fact that
			Doctor Daystrom was working in
			effective isolation. And that
			cannot be permitted to happen
			again.
			I respect the need for peer review
			and control precautions. I would
			submit that you will find them
			here aboard the Enterprise. My
			crew has served for years with
			Data. Unlike your research
			people, we have enough such
			experience to reliably judge what
			is "normal" and "abnormal"
			behavior for Soong-type androids.
			We are uniquely qualified to
			assist in guiding Lal's
			development.
			That is what I'm here to decide,
			Captain.
			So Lal now possesses the sum of
			my programming.
			Her neural nets are laid down
			identically to yours?
			There do seem to be variations
			on the quantum level. Lal can use
			contractions... I cannot.
			An aberration... what have you
			done about it?
			I have maintained records on
			positronic matrix activity,
			behavioral norms, and all verbal
			patterns... I have seen no
			evidence of other aberrations...
			It would seem that you have
			actually improved upon yourself,
			Data.
			Is that not the goal of every
			parent, sir?
			But... as a good... father...
			don't you think it would be
			better, especially in light of
			this aberration, if Lal could be
			close to the best possible
			equipment and the best-trained
			minds to perform diagnostic,
			evaluative and repair procedures?
			I have been programmed with all
			the procedures you have mentioned.
			And in any meaningful evaluation
			of Lal, you would require a model
			for a basis of comparison. I am
			the only model available, Admiral.
			You haven't mastered human
			cultural and behavioral norms
			yourself yet, have you?
			Nosir.
			Then, if the object of Lal's
			existence is for her to understand
			human behavior, wouldn't you admit
			that you are an imperfect
			teacher... in fact, she may choose
			to emulate you rather than
			humans... even if you instruct
			her otherwise.
			On the other hand, Admiral, how
			many of your researchers are
			androids? None. And I would
			suggest that many aspects of Lal's
			existence and development may be
			so alien to human experience that
			your people simply could not be
			made to comprehend them.
			Where is Lal now?
			This is your idea of appropriate
			guidance...
			It is an opportunity for her to
			observe human behavior and more
			importantly to interact with her
			crewmates.
			She's capable of running over
			sixty trillion calculations per
			second and you have her working as
			a cocktail waitress.
			Admiral, she is working under the
			strict guidance of a woman in
			whom I have absolute trust.
			Ten-Forward is the center of the
			ship's social activity. Everyone
			on board comes here...
			I'm not convinced the sort of
			behavior she observes here will
			be a positive influence.
			My customers usually behave
			themselves... if not, they're
			asked to leave. There's something
			to learn from that as well,
			wouldn't you say?
			Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs
			Ten-Forward.
			How is Lal doing, Guinan?
			She spills a few drinks like the
			rest of us. But she's learning
			a lot.
			I'm sorry, this is just
			outrageous.
			Come now, Admiral, I'm sure you've
			been in a few bars in your day...
			I want the android out of here...
			have her report to me immediately
			for an interview.
			Well, I've been looking forward
			to meeting you, Lal.
			Why?
			You're very important to us at
			Starfleet Research. We've got
			quite a facility at Galor Four.
			I'd like to show it to you.
			The Admiral is in fact suggesting
			you be moved to Galor Four, Lal.
			Have I done something wrong?
			Not at all. But it is important
			to broaden your experiences. And
			there's just so much you can learn
			aboard a starship, wouldn't you
			agree?
			Yes, I'd agree.
			Good.
			Thus, the natural conclusion would
			be when I have learned all there
			is to learn aboard the starship,
			I would relocate to Galor Four.
			I don't agree. That is not the
			natural conclusion here.
			I believe it is.
			You see, she resists alternative
			suggestions to her own father's
			wishes. That's not a good sign.
			Excuse me, sir, I do not know my
			father's wishes.
			He did not "warn" you about this
			conversation?
			Warn me? No, Admiral. He told me
			to answer your questions.
			The admiral is concerned that you
			need more guidance than your
			father can provide here on the
			Enterprise.
			Do not misunderstand. I have
			great respect for your... father.
			You do not speak with respect.
			I find her very adversarial.
			I am only stating a fact, Admiral.
			Apparently, your father has not
			taught you about selective
			judgment in verbalizing your
			thoughts. This is a skill we can
			help you develop.
			My father is already helping me,
			sir.
			Yes, well, the question is whether
			he's helping you enough.
			Are you asking me, sir?
			No, I didn't mean...
			Why don't we, Admiral? In all
			these discussions, we've never
			once mentioned Lal's wishes.
			She's a free, sentient being.
			What are your wishes, Lal?
			I wish to remain here, Captain
			Picard.
			Thank you. You're excused.
			Come in.
			Hello, Lal. How are you?
			An admiral from Starfleet has come
			to take me away, Troi. I'm
			scared.
			You are scared, aren't you?
			I... feel it. How is that
			possible?
			I don't know.
			This is what it means to feel.
			This is what it means to feel.
			Commander, you have Lal off to
			a wonderful start in life. And
			that's what being a parent is all
			about. But I have decided I must
			ask you to release her to me.
			May I know why, sir?
			All the other arguments aside,
			there is one that is irrefutable.
			There are only two Soong-type
			androids in existence. It is far
			too dangerous to have the two of
			you in one place. Especially on
			a starship. One lucky shot by
			some Romulan and we lose you both.
			That's a fine argument, Admiral.
			But it doesn't change my feeling
			that the proper place for Lal to
			develop is by Data's side.
			You're not a parent, Captain.
			I am. I've learned, with
			difficulty, that there's a time
			when...
			... all parents have to let go of
			our children... for their own
			good.
			This is not that time. The
			umbilical cord is virtually uncut.
			The child...
			... the child depends on him.
			Mister Data, it would be much
			better for Lal if she left knowing
			you had voluntarily decided this
			was the best course of action.
			Admiral, when I created Lal, it
			was with the hope that someday
			she would choose to enter the
			Academy and become a member of
			Starfleet. I wanted to give
			something back in return for all
			Starfleet has given me. I still
			do. But Lal is my child. You
			ask that I volunteer to give her
			up. I cannot. That would
			violate every lesson I have
			learned about human parenting.
			As Captain Picard told me after
			he first met her, I have taken
			on "quite a responsibility." I
			have brought a new life into this
			world. It is my duty, not
			Starfleet's, to guide her through
			these first difficult steps to
			maturity, to support her as she
			learns, to prepare her to be a
			contributing member of society.
			No one can relieve me of that
			obligation. And I cannot ignore
			it. I am her father.
			Then, Mister Data, I regret that
			I must order you to transport Lal
			aboard my ship.
			Belay that order, Commander.
			I beg... your pardon?
			I'll take the matter to Starfleet
			myself.
			I am Starfleet, Captain... and
			this is an order. Proceed,
			Commander.
			Hold your ground, Mister Data.
			Do you understand you're risking
			your command and your career,
			Captain?
			There are times, sir, when men
			of good conscience cannot blindly
			follow orders. You acknowledge
			they are sentient, but ignore
			their personal liberty and
			freedom. Order a man to turn his
			child over to the state? Not
			while I am his captain. If you
			wish, the Enterprise is prepared
			to accompany you to Starfleet
			Command and then we'll see what...
			Troi to Commander Data. Report
			to your lab at once.
			Acknowledged, Counselor. He's
			on his way. Is there a problem?
			Yes, Captain, something is
			terribly wrong with Lal.
			It lasted barely a moment. She
			experienced an extraordinary range
			of feelings... fear, excitement,
			pleasure... she could barely catch
			her breath... and then...
			For no apparent reason she got
			up and walked out of my quarters...
			she didn't say another word, she
			just started walking here... and
			each step became more and more
			difficult...
			Lal is programmed to return to
			the lab in the event of a
			malfunction.
			Father.
			Yes, Lal. I am here.
			A malfunction. Emotional
			awareness.
			It would appear to be a symptom
			of cascade failure. It will
			require reinitializing the base
			matrix without wiping out the
			higher functions.
			I agree.
			May I assist, Commander?
			Thank you, Admiral.
			If you'll excuse us, Commander
			Data and I have much to do.
			She won't survive much longer.
			There was nothing anyone could
			have done. We'd repolarize
			one pathway and another would
			collapse. And then another. And
			his hands started moving faster
			than I could see, trying to stay
			ahead of each breakdown. He
			refused to give up. He was
			remarkable.
			It just wasn't meant to be.
			Lal, I am unable to correct the
			system failure.
			I... know.
			We must say good-bye now.
			I... feel...
			What do you feel, Lal?
			I... love... you... Father.
			I wish I could feel it with you.
			I... will... feel... it... for...
			both... of... us.
			Thank you... for... my... life.
			Flirt-ing... laugh-ter... fam-ily...
			paint-ing... fe-male...
			hu-man.
			Lal suffered complete neural system
			failure at thirteen hundred hours.
			I have deactivated the unit.
			The crew grieves for your loss,
			Mister Data.
			I thank you for your sympathy.
			But she is here.
			Her presence so enriched my life
			that I could not allow her to pass
			into oblivion. So I incorporated
			her programs back into my own...
			I transferred her memories to me.
			Mister Data, take your position.
			Mister Crusher, set course for
			the starbase on Otar Two.
			Course set, sir.
			Engage.
