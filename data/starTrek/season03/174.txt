			Captain's log, Stardate 43994.1.
			The Enterprise has arrived at
			Jouret Four in response to a
			distress signal from one of the
			Federation's outermost colonies.
			Anything from the surface?
			Nossir. There have been no
			communications from the colony
			for over twelve hours.
			Sensors picking up any signs of
			life?
			None.
			The surface environment is safe
			for transport, Commander.
			Mister O'Brien, verify these are
			accurate coordinates for New
			Providence colony.
			Coordinates verified, sir. You're
			at the center of town.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43997.6.
			Admiral Hanson and Lieutenant
			Commander Shelby of Starfleet
			Tactical have arrived to review
			the disappearance of New
			Providence colony. No sign
			remains of the nine hundred
			inhabitants.
			The truth is... hell, we're not
			ready. We've known they were
			coming for over a year... we've
			thrown every resource we've got
			into this but still...
			Then, you're convinced it is the
			Borg... ?
			That's what I'm here to find out.
			The initial descriptions of these
			surface conditions are almost
			identical to your reports from
			system J-two-five.
			Mister Riker wrote those
			reports... he agrees with you.
			Commander Shelby took over Borg
			tactical analysis six months ago.
			I've learned to give her a wide
			latitude when I want to get things
			done... That's how I intend to
			operate here.
			My priority has been to develop
			some kind, any kind of defense
			strategy...
			Obviously nothing we have now can
			stop them.
			We've been designing new
			weapons... but they're still on
			the drawing board.
			We expected much more lead time.
			Your encounter with the Borg was
			over seven thousand light years
			away...
			If this is the Borg, it would
			indicate they have a source of
			power far superior to our own...
			I'd like to see the colony site
			as soon as possible, Captain.
			It'll be night at the site in
			thirty minutes. We've scheduled
			an away team for dawn.
			Why don't you show the commander
			to her quarters...
			It's our poker night, Admiral.
			There's always an open seat for
			you...
			Next time, Commander. Your
			captain and I have a lot to cover.
			But rumor has it that Commander
			Shelby's played a hand or two...
			Keep your eye on her, Jean-Luc.
			One impressive young lady...
			You seem rather taken with her,
			J.P.
			Just an old man's fantasies. When
			Shelby came into tactical, every
			damned admiral's uncle had a take
			on this Borg business... she cut
			through it, put us on track.
			Earl Grey?
			Four sugars.
			She'd make you a hell of a first
			officer.
			I already have a hell of a first
			officer.
			Don't tell me he's gonna pass up
			another commission?
			One's available?
			The Melbourne. It's his if he
			wants it. Hasn't he told you?
			Well, I guess I knew this day
			would have to come... he'll make
			a fine captain, J.P.
			You may want to tell him that.
			We're still waiting for his
			decision. Hell, this is the third
			time we've pulled out the
			captain's chair for Riker. He
			just won't sit down. And I'll
			tell you something -- there are
			a lot of young hotshots like
			Shelby on their way up. Riker
			could suddenly look like he's
			standing still next to them. He's
			hurting his career by staying put.
			If I were you, I'd kick him in
			the rear end for his own good.
			We know the Borg have no interest
			in power or political conquest...
			They identify what's useful to
			them, then consume it. Or try
			to at least...
			But here's the question -- after
			they take what they want... what
			happens to the rest?
			There has to be some evidence...
			residue... something that tells
			us they've been here.
			I don't know exactly what I'm
			looking for... but we've tested
			the sections of the Enterprise's
			hull that were damaged by the
			Borg. There were some unusual
			magnetic-resonance traces...
			A Borg footprint?
			That's my theory. I'll see if
			it holds up tomorrow.
			I've reviewed your personnel...
			I'll be assigning Mister La Forge
			and Mister Data to accompany me
			on the away team...
			I've... already assigned them to
			the away team, Commander. And
			I'll be with you as well.
			Of course. I appreciate any
			assistance you can offer.
			Tell me, something, Commander...
			is serving aboard the Enterprise
			as extraordinary an experience
			as I've heard?
			Every bit of it.
			Good.
			Because I intend to convince
			Captain Picard that I'm the right
			choice for the job.
			Job? Which job... ?
			Yours, of course.
			I'm sorry... I heard you were
			leaving.
			If I am... I'm sure you'll be the
			first to know, Commander.
			Poker's at seventeen hundred
			hours, my quarters, deck eight...
			I will buy another card,
			Counselor.
			Got another king in the hole,
			Data?
			I am afraid I cannot answer that
			Wesley. And as you are a newcomer
			to the game, may I say it is
			inappropriate to ask.
			No help there.
			Fold. Again.
			I'm in.
			Three jacks looking back for the
			handsome young ensign.
			Beginner's luck.
			Pair of deuces stands.
			Possible flush, possible straight
			flush. The bet is yours, Mister
			Crusher.
			I'm in for ten...
			Time to put on the long pants,
			Wes. I'll see your ten. And
			raise you a hundred.
			He's got the straight flush.
			Not necessarily. Commander Riker
			may be bluffing, Wesley.
			I don't think so. I fold.
			With three jacks?
			Wesley, you may get straight A's
			in school, but you've still got
			a little to learn about poker...
			I've only got two pair, Commander.
			But I've got to see that blind
			card. I'll call.
			You got him!
			Mister Data and our guest appear
			to be tardy...
			Sir, Commander Shelby and Data
			beamed down to the planet surface
			an hour ago...
			On whose authority?
			On... hers, sir.
			Morning. Early bird gets the
			worm, eh? We've had some
			interesting results...
			Commander Shelby...
			Walk with me, Commander.
			I believe Commander Shelby
			erred... there are no known
			avifaunal or crawling vermicular
			lifeforms on Jouret Four.
			That's... not what she meant,
			Data... but, uh, you're right,
			she erred...
			I'm sorry... I woke up early and
			I saw a weather system was moving
			in... it could have affected the
			soil readings...
			So without any regard to the risk
			of coming down alone...
			Really, Commander... if we ran
			into the Borg, two extra bodies
			wouldn't've made a hell of a
			difference, would they? We had
			three hours before the storm front
			hit, less than two hours now.
			Data was available. I took him.
			We came. I don't see your
			problem...
			My problem, Commander, is I expect
			to be notified before there's a
			change in my orders...
			Noted for future reference. Do
			you wish to hear my report, sir?
			Go ahead.
			The soil contains the same
			magnetic-resonance traces...
			That's our footprint. There's
			no doubt any more. It's the Borg.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43998.5.
			With confirmation of the Borg's
			presence in Federation space,
			Admiral Hanson has returned to
			Starbase three two four to discuss
			strategy with Starfleet Command.
			Lieutenant Commander Shelby
			remains on board to continue
			tactical preparations.
			... a standing Yellow Alert...
			all Federation and allied outposts
			have been warned... Ops will
			continue to monitor long range
			sensors... I've assigned Data,
			La Forge and Mister Crusher to
			work with Commander Shelby.
			Very good, Number One. You've
			covered all the bases. As usual.
			What's your impression of Shelby?
			She knows her stuff, Captain.
			She has your full confidence...
			Well, I think she needs...
			supervision.
			She takes the initiative a little
			too... easily. Sometimes with
			risks.
			Sounds a little like a young
			lieutenant commander I once
			recruited as my first officer.
			Perhaps.
			You're the best officer I've ever
			served with, Will.
			But what are you still doing here?
			Sir?
			I hear you've been offered the
			Melbourne.
			I've decided not to pursue the
			commission at this time.
			She's a fine ship, Will.
			She's not the Enterprise.
			With all due respect, sir, you
			need me. Particularly now.
			Starfleet needs good captains.
			Particularly now. I cannot keep
			you to myself forever.
			I want you to reconsider your
			decision.
			Are you asking me to leave,
			Captain?
			I'm asking you to look at your
			career objectively and make the
			best decision.
			I know it's hard to walk away.
			But you're ready to work without
			a net, my friend. You're ready
			to make the life and death
			decisions a captain must make.
			And, hard as it is to accept, if
			you choose to leave, the
			Enterprise will go on just fine
			without you.
			What am I still doing here,
			Deanna? I've pushed myself hard
			to get this far...
			... sacrificed a lot.
			I've always said I wanted my own
			command. And yet something's
			holding me back. Is it wrong to
			want to stay... ?
			What do you think?
			Maybe I'm just afraid of the big
			chair.
			I don't think so.
			The captain says Shelby reminds
			him of the way I used to be. And
			he's right. She comes in here,
			full of drive and ambition,
			impatient, taking risks... I look
			at her and I wonder whatever
			happened to those things in me? I
			I liked those things in me.
			I've lost something.
			You mean you're older, more
			experienced... a little more
			seasoned...
			"Seasoned". What a horrible thing
			to say to a man.
			I don't think you've lost a
			thing... and you've gained a lot
			more than you realize. You're
			much more comfortable with
			yourself than you used to be...
			Maybe that's the problem. Could
			be I'm too comfortable here.
			I'm not sure I know what that
			means.
			You're happy here... happier than
			I've ever known you to be. It
			really comes down to a simple
			question -- what do you want, Will
			Riker?
			What?
			Stupid. An old song I heard when
			I was a kid. Keeps running
			through my mind...
			"Didja ever have the feeling that
			you wanted to go... still had the
			feeling that you wanted to stay...
			You knew it was right... wasn't
			wrong... still you knew you
			wouldn't be very long... it's
			tough to have the feeling that
			you wanted to go... "
			"... still had the feeling that
			you wanted to stay... start to
			go... change your mind... "
			You start on Friday -- two shows
			a night, matinee on Wednesday.
			I play the trombone too...
			... a manipulation effect in the
			Borg ship's subspace field...
			a definite pattern -- at
			four-point-eight minute intervals
			during your first confrontation
			with them.
			Might indicate high-output
			auxiliary generators kicking in.
			One theory is that their systems
			are decentralized with redundant
			power sources located throughout
			the ship.
			It is a reasonable conclusion.
			Borg technology has given each
			member of their society the
			ability to interface and function
			collectively. It is likely they
			would construct their ship with
			the same philosophy.
			Knock out one generator and
			another takes over without
			interruption.
			What kind of damage would we have
			to do to shut them down... ?
			Projections suggest a Borg ship
			like this one could continue to
			function effectively even if
			seventy-eight percent of it was
			inoperable.
			And our best shot barely scratched
			the surface.
			From what I've seen, I can't
			believe any of your new weapons
			systems can be ready in less than
			eighteen months, Commander.
			We've been projecting twenty-four.
			Is there anything here we can try
			to adapt to our current defense
			systems... ?
			We'll have to look through the
			specs again.
			I don't know. My mind's turned
			to clay.
			Mine too.
			I think we should look at
			modifying the plasma phaser
			design...
			Commander, I think we should call
			it a night.
			All right. Anyone who's really
			that tired... if you want to
			leave...
			No, that's okay...
			Go ahead, Commander...
			What would happen if we take the
			frequency klystron from the
			existing unit...
			We'll break here. That's an
			order. We'll reconvene at oh five
			hundred...
			Sir, if you'll allow me to
			continue with Mister Data, who
			does not require rest...
			You need rest, Commander.
			If we have a confrontation with
			the Borg without improving our
			defense systems...
			If we have a confrontation, I
			don't want a crew fighting the
			Borg at the same time they're
			fighting their own fatigue...
			Dismissed.
			At nineteen hundred hours
			yesterday, the USS Lalo
			departed Zeta Alpha Two on a
			freight run to Sentinel Minor
			Four. At twenty-two hundred hours
			and twelve minutes, a distress
			signal was received at Starbase
			one five seven. The Lalo reported
			contact with an alien vessel...
			... described as cube-shaped. The
			distress signal ended abruptly.
			She has not been heard from since.
			How long to get there at warp
			nine, Mister Data?
			One hour, seventeen minutes, sir.
			Make it so.
			We're coming with every available
			starship to assist, Captain. But
			the closest help is six days away.
			We'll try to occupy them pending
			your arrival, Admiral.
			I know you will. Hanson out.
			All hands will stand to battle
			stations...
			Commander Shelby, status of
			defense preparations?
			Mister La Forge has a plan to
			modulate shield nutation...
			hopefully, that'll hold them off
			for awhile.
			At the same time, we're retuning
			phasers to higher EM-base
			emitting frequencies -- we'll try
			to disrupt their subspace field.
			Your assessment of our potential
			effectiveness?
			Shot in the dark, Captain. Best
			we can do for now.
			Dismissed.
			Sir, reading an unidentified
			vessel just entering sensor range,
			bearing two-one-zero mark
			one-five-one...
			Hail them, Mister Worf...
			No response, sir...
			Move to intercept.
			Sir, the vessel has already
			changed course to intercept us.
			Approaching at... warp nine point
			three... Entering visual
			range...
			On screen.
			Magnify.
			Mister Worf, dispatch a subspace
			message to Admiral Hanson -- we
			have engaged the Borg.
			Captain, you are being hailed.
			I am?
			Yes, Captain. By name.
			Data, is it the same ship we faced
			at J-two-five?
			Uncertain, Commander. However,
			dimensions are precisely the same.
			On screen.
			I am Jean-Luc...
			Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the
			Starship Enterprise, registry
			NCC-1701D, you will lower shields
			and prepare to transport yourself
			aboard our vessel. If you do not
			cooperate, we will destroy your
			ship.
			You have committed acts of
			aggression against the United
			Federation of Planets. If you
			do not immediately withdraw...
			You will surrender yourself or
			we will destroy your ship. Your
			defensive capabilities are unable
			to withstand us.
			What the hell could they want with
			you?
			I thought they weren't interested
			in human lifeforms... only our
			technology.
			Their priorities seem to have
			changed. Open channel.
			We have developed new defense
			capabilities since our last
			meeting and we are prepared to
			use them if you do not withdraw
			from Federation space. If you
			do so immediately, I will agree
			to arrange a conference of our
			peoples at a neutral location.
			Shields are being probed... I'm
			modulating nutation...
			Sir, the Borg are attempting to
			lock on to us with their tractor
			beam...
			Load all torpedo bays... ready
			phasers... target coordinates on
			the source of the tractor beam...
			Status of shields...
			Holding...
			The nutation modulation has them
			confused...
			They have the ability to analyze
			and adapt, Commander...
			Shield modulation has failed...
			they've locked on...
			Shields are being drained...
			ninety per cent... eighty...
			Trying to recalibrate nutation...
			damn...
			Shields have failed.
			Fire all weapons...
			Their subspace field is intact...
			new phaser frequencies had no
			impact...
			Reverse engines...
			Full reverse... we're not
			moving...
			Fire at will...
			Launching torpedos... phaser
			spread continuing...
			Still no damage to the Borg
			vessel, sir...
			Warning. Outer hull breach.
			They're cutting into the hull...
			Engineering section...
			Geordi... evacuate Engineering...
			Computer. Evacuation sequence...
			Redirecting Engineering control
			to bridge. Sealing doors to core

			Move it people!
			Warning. Inner hull failing.
			Decompression danger, deck
			thirty-six, section four.
			Sealing Main Engineering.
			Data, fluctuate phaser resonance
			frequencies... random settings...
			keep changing them... don't give
			them time to adapt...
			The tractor beam has been
			released.
			Warp nine. Course one-five-one
			mark three-three-zero... engage...
			They are in pursuit, Captain.
			Maintain course.
			Damage report, Geordi.
			Hull rupture in Main
			Engineering... damage is heavy...
			We lost a lot of good people down
			there.
			Eleven dead... eight more
			unaccounted for, Captain.
			Repair teams to Engineering...
			seal hull breach...
			They didn't get to the core...
			I can control functions from
			here...
			Approaching the Paulson Nebula,
			sir...
			Drop to impulse... take us in,
			Ensign...
			The field is getting too dense,
			sir...
			Steady... Mister Data, analysis
			of the nebula cloud...
			Eighty-two percent Dilithium
			hydroxyls... manganese, chromium.
			It should provide an effective
			screen against their sensors,
			sir...
			Prepare to take us in, Mister
			Crusher. Now. Mister La Forge,
			prepare to reverse engines, full
			stop.
			The Borg ship is continuing
			scans... attempting to locate
			us...
			Good. As long as they're looking
			for us... they can't hurt anyone
			else.
			Shut down all active sensors,
			passive scanners only. Deflectors
			to minimum emissions.
			We'll maintain position.
			Until we have a better idea.
			Time index five-one-four... Data
			started to fluctuate phaser
			resonance frequencies... the
			Borg's beam breaks contact...
			Freeze picture.
			Take a close look, Commander...
			Mister La Forge?
			There's a two percent power drop,
			just for an instant... but it's
			system-wide... The phaser
			frequency spread was in a high
			narrow band.
			Conceivably, the ship's power
			distribution nodes are vulnerable
			to those frequencies.
			If we can generate a concentrated
			burst of energy with that same
			frequency distribution... I mean
			a lot more than anything our
			phasers or photon torpedos could
			provide...
			How do we do that?
			The main deflector dish.
			It's the only component of the
			Enterprise designed to channel
			that much power at controlled
			frequencies.
			Unfortunately, there is one slight
			detail -- in the process, the
			blast completely destroys the
			Enterprise as well.
			But if we could get far enough
			away... increase the deflector
			range...
			It could work. In the meantime,
			we should retune all phasers,
			including hand units, to the same
			frequency.
			Proceed. I'll inform the
			Captain...
			There's one other recommendation
			I'd like to make, Commander.
			Separate the saucer section...
			assign a skeleton crew to create
			a diversion...
			We may need power from the saucer
			impulse engines...
			But it would give them more than
			one target to worry about.
			No, it's too great a risk...
			I'd like the captain to make that
			decision, sir.
			I bring all alternatives to the
			captain's attention, Commander.
			That'll be all.
			I'll need to install
			higher-capacity power transfers
			to the deflector dish,
			Commander...
			How long...
			Better part of a day.
			She gets a full head of steam up,
			doesn't she...
			Yessir... she's... a formidable
			presence to say the least. But
			I'm convinced she can help us
			here, Commander...
			I am too, Geordi. Don't worry
			about it. I can handle Shelby.
			Come.
			Come in, Number One... Commander
			Shelby was just telling me of your
			concerns about her plan...
			I'm sorry that she troubled you,
			sir... I already informed her...
			Yes, I entirely agree with you.
			It's not the time. But I am
			afraid the time may eventually
			come when greater risks are
			required. I'd like you to
			consider her plan as a fall-back
			position and make the necessary
			preparations.
			Very good, sir.
			Deck eight. Battle bridge.
			Halt.
			You and I have to talk, Commander.
			You never ordered me not to
			discuss this with the captain...
			You disagree with me, fine. You
			want to take it to the captain,
			fine. Through me. You do an end
			run around me again, I'll snap
			you back so hard, you'll think
			you're a first year cadet again.
			May I speak frankly, sir?
			By all means.
			You're in my way.
			Really? How terrible for you.
			All you know how to do is play
			it safe... I guess that's why
			someone like you sits in the
			shadow of a great man for as long
			as you have, passing up one
			command after another.
			Proceed to deck eight.
			When it comes to this ship, to
			this crew, you're damned right
			I'll play it safe.
			If you can't make the big
			decisions, Commander, I suggest
			you make room for someone who can.
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			Enterprise remains concealed in
			the dust cloud. And to my
			surprise, the Borg have maintained
			their position, waiting for us
			to come out of hiding. I have
			no explanation for their special
			interest in me or this ship.
			We continue to prepare our
			defenses for the inevitable
			confrontation. But, I must admit,
			on this night I contemplate the
			distinct possibility that no
			defense may be adequate against
			this enemy...
			Trouble sleeping?
			Something of a tradition,
			Guinan... touring the ship before
			a battle...
			Before a hopeless battle, if I
			remember the tradition correctly.
			Not necessarily. Nelson toured
			the HMS Victory before
			Trafalgar...
			But Nelson didn't come home from
			Trafalgar, did he?
			No, but the battle was won.
			And you, Picard, do you expect
			this battle to be won?
			We may yet prevail. It is a
			conceit but a healthy one.
			I wonder if the Emperor Honorious
			watching the Visigoths coming over
			the seventh hill could truly
			realize that the Roman Empire was
			about to fall. This is really
			just another page of history,
			isn't it? Will this be the end
			of our civilization?
			... Turn the page.
			It is not the end.
			You say that with remarkable
			assuredness.
			With experience. When the Borg
			destroyed my world, my people
			scattered throughout the
			universe. But we survived. And
			so will humanity. As long as
			there is a handful left to keep
			the spirit alive. You will
			prevail. Even if it takes a
			millennium.
			Captain Picard, report to the
			bridge.
			On my way, Lieutenant.
			They're some kind of
			magnetometric-guided charges.
			Status of shields.
			Back to forty-eight percent,
			Captain.
			Mister La Forge, I may have to
			take us out of the nebula... I'll
			need all the power you can give
			me.
			Engines are ready, Captain.
			Recommend you adjust shield
			harmonics to favor the upper EM
			band when you proceed...
			Acknowledged.
			Direct hit... deck nine...
			Damage report...
			Structural latching system
			integrity breached...
			Take us out of here, Number One...
			Fire up the engines... half
			impulse until we clear the
			nebula... then punch it to warp
			nine.
			Ready phasers... load forward
			torpedo bays...
			Engage.
			Borg tractor beam is attempting
			to lock on...
			Fire at will. Continue rotating
			shield frequ...
			Shields are failing...
			Tractor beam has locked on.
			They're holding us...
			It's no use... they've already
			adapted to the new frequencies...
			The Borg ship is disengaging...
			leaving at warp speed...
			Maintain pursuit...
			Borg vessel has reached warp
			nine... nine-point-four...
			nine-point-six...
			Stay with them.
			Riker to O'Brien. Can you get
			a fix on the captain?
			Negative, sir. There's some kind
			of interference. I can't lock
			in on his signal.
			Senior officers report to the
			bridge.
			Sir, the coordinates they've
			set... they're on a direct
			course... to sector zero-zero-one.
			The Terran system.
			Earth.
			Captain Jean-Luc Picard, you lead
			the strongest ship of the
			Federation Starfleet. You speak
			for your people.
			I have nothing to say to you, and
			I will resist you with my last
			ounce of strength.
			Strength is irrelevant.
			Resistance is futile. We wish to
			improve ourselves. We will add
			your biological and technological
			distinctiveness to our own. Your
			culture will adapt to service ours.
			Impossible. My culture is based
			on freedom and self-determination.
			Freedom is irrelevant. Self-determination
			is irrelevant. You must comply.
			We would rather die.
			Death is irrelevant.
			What is it you wish of me?
			Your archaic cultures are
			authority driven. To facilitate
			our introduction into your
			societies, it has been decided
			that a human voice will speak for
			us in all communications. You
			have been chosen to be that voice.
			They're leading us into the heart
			of our own defenses...
			So far, they haven't had any
			reason to worry about our
			defenses...
			Commander, if the Borg stay at
			warp nine-point-six, we'll be
			forced to discontinue pursuit and
			power down in less than three
			hours.
			Two hours, forty minutes and three
			seconds.
			How soon before the deflector is
			ready?
			We're close. Few hours maybe...
			I know I'll get it done in two...
			somehow... but Commander, I need
			serious power from the warp
			engines to make this weapon work.
			We're using all we've got just
			to keep up with them...
			We've got to get that ship down
			to impulse.
			I'm leading an away team over
			there to get the captain back.
			We'll find a way to bring them
			out of warp...
			Ensign Crusher... continue to
			assist Mister La Forge...
			Commander Shelby, you will take
			the bridge and coordinate with
			Starfleet... Data, Worf, Doctor
			Crusher, you're with me...
			Excuse me, sir... with my
			knowledge of the Borg...
			Those are my orders, Commander.
			Commander Riker...
			It is inappropriate for you to
			lead the away team. Until the
			return of Captain Picard, you are
			in command of the Enterprise.
			We are in a state of war. Your
			place is on the bridge.
			Commander Shelby, you will lead
			the away team.
			Make it so.
			First officer's log, supplemental.
			Our pursuit of the Borg continues
			at high warp on a course that
			will take us to the very core of
			the Federation. The devastation
			they could bring is beyond
			imagination.
			These phasers have been retuned.
			Each has a different frequency
			spanning the upper EM band.
			All right... a reminder... we only
			get to use each of these once,
			maybe twice before the Borg learn
			to adapt. Don't fire until you
			have to...
			What kind of resistance can we
			expect?
			At our last encounter, the Borg
			virtually ignored us when we
			beamed aboard their vessel,
			Doctor. They clearly did not
			consider our being there a
			threat.
			That could very well change,
			however, if we start interfering
			with their plans.
			Shelby to bridge. Away team
			ready.
			We've got fifty-eight minutes
			before we have to power down and
			disengage.
			Understood.
			Proceed.
			Commander, no unnecessary risks.
			If it becomes clear you can't
			succeed, I want you back here,
			alive... I don't want any dead
			heroes. Clear?
			Very clear, sir. Shelby out.
			We've matched warp velocity for
			transport, Commander.
			Energize.
			Tricorder functions are minimal.
			Any signs of human life?
			Inconclusive.
			Look at this... this is
			extraordinary.
			These appear to be some kind of
			power waveguide conduits which
			allow them to work collectively
			as they perform ship functions.
			There's no way to take out enough
			of these to slow them down.
			The decentralized power system
			makes it virtually impossible.
			What about looking at it... from
			the mosquito's point of view.
			An interesting metaphor, Doctor.
			What is your idea?
			If we sting them in a tender
			spot... at least we might get them
			to stop a minute to scratch.
			Distribution nodes.
			If we take out a few of these,
			it just might make them scratch...
			The captain's communicator...
			it is still activated.
			Crusher to Picard, can you hear
			me, Captain...
			Can you locate it, Worf?
			This way...
			I strongly recommend redeploying
			all available defenses to protect
			sector zero-zero-one, Admiral...
			We're moving to intercept at Wolf
			three five nine. We'll make our
			stand there. How much longer can
			you maintain pursuit?
			Twenty-two minutes if they stay
			at current speed. If we can't
			bring them out of warp, we'll
			do as much damage as we can before
			we have to disengage.
			Picard?
			Nothing yet, sir.
			In here.
			Shelby to Enterprise.
			Go ahead.
			We've found the captain's uniform.
			And his communicator.
			We're resuming our search.
			Stand by, Commander.
			We're in business.
			It'll burn out the main
			deflector... but it'll be one hell
			of a bang.
			Radiation danger?
			We'll need to evacuate the entire
			forward half of the secondary
			hull. And the lower three decks
			of the saucer.
			I'll see to that.
			Commander Shelby... we have only
			seventeen minutes of warp power
			left. Do what you can to get
			them out of warp.
			Acknowledged. Shelby out.
			Let's take out some of these
			distribution nodes and see what
			happens...
			Get ready. This may rile up our
			friends.
			Ready phasers...
			Fire.
			Enterprise, encountering
			resistance, prepare to beam us
			back on my signal...
			Enterprise... beam us...
			Wait! Look --
			Captain!
			Enterprise, get us out of here.
			Sir, they did it... the Borg ship
			is dropping out of warp...
			Go to impulse.
			Diverting warp energy to main
			deflector...
			Move us to within forty thousand
			kilometers, match velocity.
			Commence arming sequence...
			Increase deflector modulation to
			upper frequency band...
			The captain?
			Sir, Captain Picard has been
			altered by the Borg. We were
			unable to retrieve him...
			Altered... ?
			He is a Borg, sir.
			We'll go back... I need more
			people... we need to retune the
			phasers again... we'll get him
			out of there...
			Commander, reading subspace field
			fluctuations within the Borg ship.
			Looks like they're regenerating...
			restoring power. They could be
			capable of warp any minute.
			Is the deflector ready?
			Ready, sir.
			Will, he's alive... if we get him
			back, I might be able to
			restore...
			This is our only chance to destroy
			them... if they get back into warp,
			our weapon becomes useless.
			We'll go back... we'll sabotage
			them again if we have to...
			We can't maintain pursuit. We
			don't have the power.
			Prepare to fire.
			At least consult with Starfleet
			Command.
			Get Admiral Hanson on subspace...
			Belay that order, Lieutenant.
			There's no time...
			Sir, we are being hailed by the
			Borg...
			On screen.
			I am Locutus of Borg. Resistance
			is futile. Your life as it has
			been is over. From this time
			forward, you will service... us.
			Mister Worf... fire.
