			Captain's log, Stardate 43489.2.
			We have arrived at Angosia, a
			planet that is eager for
			membership in the Federation.
			I'm greatly impressed with what
			I've seen so far, Prime Minister.
			Then I hope it will reflect
			favorably in your report, Captain.
			It's a tribute to your people to
			have recovered so rapidly from
			the Tarsian War.
			It is indeed.
			We are not warriors. We believe
			reason can settle disputes. But
			not every culture agrees with our
			position.
			An unfortunate reality.
			The development of the mind, the
			cultivation of the intellect --
			these are the pursuits to which
			the Angosians have dedicated
			themselves for centuries.
			I'm sorry to interrupt, Prime
			Minister. There's a problem.
			May I see you a moment?
			Excuse me, gentlemen.
			I think they'll make a fine
			addition to the Federation, Number
			One...
			I'm not sure I'd want to live
			here. A little stuffy for my
			taste.
			A prisoner has escaped from the
			penal colony on Lunar Five.
			Two guards are dead. The prisoner
			has taken a transport vessel.
			Do you have means of pursuit?
			The tracking station was
			sabotaged. The entire base is
			in chaos. We have ordered ships
			from the surface to follow him,
			but to be honest, our civilian
			pilots are not trained to handle
			this...
			With your permission, sir... ?
			Mister Data, a stolen transport
			vessel has departed from Lunar
			Five. Have you picked it up on
			sensors?
			Yes, Commander.
			Good. Detain the vessel and
			quarantine the pilot.
			Is he armed?
			Yes. And he's very dangerous,
			Captain. Lunar Five is our
			maximum security facility.
			Did you hear that, Data?
			Yes, Commander, we will use
			extreme caution.
			Keep us informed. Riker out.
			On screen, sir...
			Specifications on the vessel,
			Mister Worf.
			No warp drive. Minimal weaponry.
			Heading, Ensign Crusher.
			Three-one-nine mark
			two-five-zero.
			Vessel's speed increasing to
			point-two impulse. He's seen us,
			Data.
			The ship's drive section...
			What happened to the rest of his
			ship?
			Scan the drive section for life
			form readings.
			None.
			Mister Crusher, bring us around
			to the back side of the asteroid.
			Sensors indicate wreckage on the
			asteroid's surface.
			No life signs.
			Apparently, he did not survive.
			Data, the drive section...
			where'd it go?
			There's no sign of it on its
			previous heading. Someone must
			be at the helm.
			Status report, Mister Data?
			I am afraid the prisoner has eluded
			us, sir.
			We followed procedures precisely.
			Scanners indicated no life forms
			present in the drive section.
			I cannot explain how he escaped.
			Incoming message from the Angosian
			prime minister.
			On screen.
			We've identified the prisoner,
			Captain. His name is Roga Danar.
			His criminal record is too long
			to go into. But you must be aware
			that he is given to bouts of
			uncontrollable violence.
			We appreciate the warning, Prime
			Minister. We will keep you posted
			on our progress.
			Mister La Forge, how far and how
			fast can that transport ship
			travel?
			Without warp drive, there's no
			way it could be outside our range
			by now.
			We've been sweeping the area
			constantly, Commander. There's
			nothing within sensor range.
			A cloaking device?
			The Angosians have no cloaking
			technology...
			Unless he's borrowing one...
			If he's hanging over the planet's
			pole, its magnetic field could
			confuse the sensors.
			I believe I can recalibrate our
			sensors to read through the
			electromagnetic interference over
			the poles, Commander.
			Realign for polar orbit.
			Aye, sir.
			There he is, Commander. You were
			correct.
			The fellow knows all the tricks,
			doesn't he...
			There are still no life form
			readings coming from the vessel.
			It could be the magnetic
			interference, Data.
			I have compensated. There are no
			readings.
			We'll have our answer shortly.
			Lock on tractor beam, Mister La
			Forge.
			Tractor beam locking on.
			Sir, the vessel is coming about.
			Is he out of his mind?
			Sensors detect a massive power
			build up in his aft thrusters.
			On Main Viewer, Mister Worf.
			He's making a suicide run.
			Shields have been automatically
			activated. Tractor beam
			disengaged.
			He's bounced off our shields.
			That's one trick I didn't even
			know about...
			Ensign Crusher, fix coordinates
			of that vessel. We'll transport
			the whole thing to a shuttlebay
			if we have to.
			I do not think that will be
			necessary, Captain. He is no
			longer in the drive section.
			I anticipated this diversionary
			tactic based on his pattern to
			date. We are picking up a
			cylindrical object approximately
			seven meters in length and three
			meters in diameter.
			On screen, Captain.
			An escape pod.
			This guy is incredible.
			Yet there are still no life form
			readings.
			Transporter Room Four, prepare
			to beam aboard anything that's
			large enough to be a humanoid
			adult from inside that pod.
			Security to Transporter Room Four.
			We are holding the contents in
			stasis pending arrival of
			security. An illicit weapon has
			been detected in the transport
			beam, sir. It's been rendered
			inoperable.
			Let's greet our guest.
			Just stay where you are.
			What the hell...
			Take him to the detention cell.
			Set phasers on kill.
			We need a few hours to get the
			containment field on Lunar Five
			operational before we pick him
			up. The damage he caused during
			his escape was considerable.
			We will await your signal.
			I appreciate your patience. Our
			prison psychologist has
			recommended you keep Danar fully
			sedated until he's ready for
			transport.
			He's in our highest security
			detention area... there shouldn't
			be any more problems...
			Do not relax your security for
			one moment, Captain. He is
			extremely violent and cunning,
			as you already know, Commander
			Riker. I'm so pleased to learn
			your injuries are not serious.
			My most sincere apologies...
			None required, Prime Minister.
			I will send a transport vessel
			to retrieve him as soon as
			possible. Nayrok out.
			Have you run a diagnostic on the
			sensors, Data?
			Yes, Commander. There is nothing
			wrong with the ship's sensors.
			The reason that we did not sense
			any life signs aboard the escape
			vessel is because the prisoner
			has no life signs.
			Computer, identify the occupant
			in the detention cell.
			The detention cell is vacant at
			this time.
			Can he be some sort of android?
			Our sensors can identify
			artificial lifeforms, Captain.
			Apparently, he is capable of
			deceiving the sensors.
			Are you all right?
			What is this ship?
			You are on board the USS
			Enterprise.
			A war vessel?
			A Federation starship.
			Federation...
			We were orbiting Angosia when you
			escaped from Lunar Five.
			It seems I am a victim of my own
			bad timing.
			And you are the keeper of this
			jail?
			I am Deanna Troi. Ship's
			counselor.
			"Counselor". Too bad. I'd rather
			you were a jailer to keep me
			company during my return trip.
			I assume that we are returning
			to Lunar Five...
			That terrifies you, doesn't it?
			I have just killed two men to get
			out of there, Counselor.
			I am fully capable of killing you
			too. A terrifying thought, isn't
			it? Even to me.
			Do they mistreat you there?
			Not at all. I am comfortable,
			well fed and housed.
			The Angosians take good care of
			their... prisoners. I am simply
			not allowed to ever leave.
			Do you visit all the prisoners,
			Counselor? Are you a specialist
			in criminal behavior? Or am I
			just an interesting specimen that
			landed on your ship like an insect
			to be studied under your
			microscope...
			Why do you have such anger toward
			me?
			A girl with long dark hair broke
			my heart long ago... out of
			bitterness and rejection, I
			turned to crime...
			How about this one -- my mother
			abandoned me when I was born and
			I never had the guidance a wild
			young man needs...
			Why are you doing this?
			Playing games? Isn't that what
			you do, Counselor? Isn't that
			what all of you mind control
			experts do?
			I am not a mind control expert.
			I came because I sensed you were
			in pain.
			And now, what do you sense?
			The pain is gone.
			Interesting, isn't it?
			There is a duality in the man...
			hard to describe... he is aware
			of his crimes... in fact, they
			deeply trouble him...
			Counselor...
			He is intelligent... a thoughtful
			man. Typically Angosian. I know
			what he's done, but when I am
			with him, I cannot believe he is
			randomly and deliberately
			violent... in fact, inherantly,
			he has a non-violent
			personality...
			Counselor, it took five men to
			restrain him... and he took apart
			half of the Transporter Room in
			the process.
			I am not opening the door for him,
			Captain.
			I can only tell you I sense
			something very unusual about this
			man. Something that is not
			inherent to a criminal
			personality...
			Your dedication to helping others
			in pain is admirable, Counselor.
			But in a few hours, I will turn
			him over to the Angosians... and
			be glad to do so.
			I understand.
			Data, do we have a link up to the
			Angosian central computer?
			Yes, Counselor... we are copying
			records for Federation inspection
			pursuant to their application for
			admittance.
			Can I see a police record on Roga
			Danar?
			There is no police record,
			Counselor.
			But that's impossible. He's been
			in prison.
			Lunar Five is a military prison
			facility...
			Military... he's a soldier... ?
			That may provide an explanation
			for the tactics he was able to
			use against us when we tried to
			capture him...
			It doesn't say what he was
			arrested for. Call up his
			military record.
			He served in many campaigns during
			the Tarsian War, received two
			promotions, to the rank of
			Subhadar... a very honorable tour
			of duty...
			What was this man's crime?
			I've learned you are a soldier.
			I was a soldier.
			Why were you put in prison?
			Obviously, because I am a threat
			to society.
			There is no police record. What
			did you do?
			Everything they asked me to do.
			That's why I became such a
			threat.
			I don't understand.
			Why are you bothering to try,
			Counselor?
			I want to help if I can.
			Unlock the door.
			Why does a non-violent man commit
			acts of excessive violence?
			You can learn to do it if you have
			to.
			Did you have to?
			It was war.
			This started in the war...
			It started the day I volunteered,
			Counselor... the day training
			began... the day I met my first
			instructor. He called himself
			a "counselor" too.
			Roga Danar was an idealistic young
			man who answered his people's call
			to service. He joined the
			military to fight for the Angosian
			way of life. He didn't realize
			that by doing so... he would
			forever have to give up that way
			of life. He's not the same man
			who left home to go to war. He's
			been through intense psychological
			manipulation as well as
			biochemical modifications.
			At Troi's request I examined
			him... his cellular structure
			has been been significantly
			altered... They used a
			combination of cryptobiolin,
			triclenidil, macrospentol... and
			a few things I don't even
			recognize.
			Was he a prisoner of war? Who
			did this to him?
			His own government.
			He has been programmed to be the
			perfect soldier. He can be
			absolutely normal, but whenever
			a danger is perceived, the
			programming clicks in and takes
			over. Intelligence, memory,
			strength, reflexes -- all become
			enhanced. He is conditioned to
			survive at any cost.
			One of the new substances in his
			cellular structure even shields
			electrical impulses.
			That would explain why our sensors
			did not detect him.
			Why was this man assigned to the
			Lunar Five facility?
			He committed no crime. He says
			he was ordered there... with
			others like him. The first
			soldiers who had returned to
			Angosia had trouble. The rules
			changed too quickly. A lost
			temper could result in murder.
			Counselor, did no one try to
			adjust their progam?
			They were simply exiled to Lunar
			Five.
			What do you want...
			Am I disturbing you?
			Yes.
			Then I will leave.
			Wait. I'd rather talk to someone.
			I'm sorry.
			Why do you have yellow eyes?
			Simply a lack of pigmentation.
			I am an android. You and I have
			something in common.
			We do?
			Yes. We have both been
			programmed.
			Ah, you have been talking with
			Counselor Troi.
			It is not at all the same,
			android.
			I do not mean to belittle your
			condition. I understand your
			dilemma. But I am curious. My
			program can be altered and
			changed. Yours cannot?
			The man I once was is still inside
			me... but this conditioning has
			been imposed... woven together
			with my thoughts and feelings and
			responses. How do you separate
			the program from the man?
			Without further analysis of your
			condition by Counselor Troi or
			Doctor Crusher, I cannot say.
			But it would seem possible.
			Doctors. Angosian doctors did
			this to me. If it could be
			undone, wouldn't they undo it?
			I cannot answer that.
			Nor can I... and I ask the
			question every moment of every
			day.
			Captain, what he is telling you
			is full of half-truths... he is
			a prisoner, what do you expect
			him to say about us?
			Then, perhaps you'd clarify it
			for me...
			These soldiers were resettled on
			Lunar Five... it was to be their
			colony...
			Their Gulag...
			I beg your pardon?
			Was it a forced "resettlement"?
			It was for their own protection
			as well as that of others. Most
			of them are quite happy there...
			we have gone to great lengths to
			give them a fine quality of
			life...
			Even the most comfortable prison
			is a prison, Prime Minister.
			A few agitators like Danar forced
			us to add security...
			Prime Minister, my medical team
			has suggested there may be
			treatment alternatives...
			Captain, I assure you all
			alternatives have been explored.
			And this discussion is now
			treading upon matters of Angosian
			security. This is not your
			concern.
			I have dispatched a ship to
			rendezvous with you and transport
			the prisoner back to Lunar Five.
			On behalf of Angosia, I thank the
			Federation for its assistance in
			retrieving our citizen.
			Were you built for combat,
			android?
			No. But my program does include
			military strategy... that is how
			I was finally able to anticipate
			your last tactic and capture you.
			You did that? Perhaps you would
			be better at combat than you
			think.
			I am not programmed to kill.
			My improved reflexes have allowed
			me to kill eighty-four times.
			And my improved memory lets me
			remember the face of each of those
			eighty-four. Can you understand
			how that feels?
			I am incapable of any feeling.
			Then I envy you.
			Roga, this is Captain Picard
			Captain...
			Mister Danar, I am going to
			transfer you back to Angosian
			security. They are en route and
			will arrive shortly. I came to
			tell you that I have no choice.
			The prime minister has insisted
			and we have no right to refuse.
			And you would be foolish if you
			even considered it, Captain...
			because they are very correct.
			I am dangerous. I have no place
			in a civilized society.
			I do not believe that.
			Nor do I.
			I respect my officers' judgement,
			Danar. I wish I could help
			further. If a way appears to me,
			I will.
			I appreciate your telling me
			face-to-face.
			I felt you deserved that much.
			You deserve to know that I must
			use whatever means I can to
			escape.
			Captain, the Angosian transport
			vessel has arrived.
			Inform them the transfer will take
			place shortly. Picard out.
			Mister Data, to the bridge
			please...
			Take care of yourself, android.
			I enjoyed our talk.
			Good-bye, Roga.
			Perhaps when this planet becomes
			a member of the Federation, we
			will be able...
			I will not be here to see it,
			Counselor. Because even with this
			overwhelming demand to survive
			that they've built into my soul...
			I would rather die than return
			to Lunar Five.
			Captain Picard, we're ready to
			receive the prisoner. Now
			transmitting the coordinates of
			our holding cell.
			Coordinates received, sir.
			Stand by for transport. Picard
			out.
			Mister Worf, have all security
			precautions been taken?
			Release of the force field and
			activation of the transporter
			will be virtually simultaneous,
			Captain... There will only be
			a point-one second interval
			between them.
			Even Danar can't move that fast.
			There will be a full security
			contingent present. Phasers will
			be set on kill.
			Proceed.
			Transporter Room One to Lieutenant
			Worf. We're ready.
			Proceed.
			Energizing...
			Roga, don't, you'll be killed...
			I'm losing him... what the
			hell... ?
			Security personnel, full alert.
			Shut down all shuttlebays,
			transporters, and turbolifts.
			Captain, a phaser is missing.
			We must assume that he's armed.
			Sound general quarters. Clear
			corridors of all non-essential
			personnel. I don't want him
			taking any hostages.
			General quarters sounded, sir.
			Raise security containment fields
			immediately on decks thirty-four,
			thirty-five, and thirty-six.
			Data... put the turbolifts back
			on line. If Danar sees they're
			operating, he may try to use one.
			Soon as he does, we have him.
			Sir, unauthorized access of
			turbolift dive on deck thirty-four.
			He took the bait.
			Data -- override its destination
			and divert that turbolift to a
			position near Lieutenant Worf's
			current location.
			We're in position.
			Four seconds to arrival.
			Phaser on overload! Seal this
			deck --
			Captain, the overload's been
			averted.
			Ingenious.
			Drop force field on deck
			thirty-six.
			Sir, containment field down on
			deck thirty-six.
			How the hell did he manage that?
			He's headed for Engineering.
			Riker to La Forge.
			Engineering -- respond.
			Sir -- someone in Engineering is
			attempting to override the
			security system lockout.
			Riker to Worf. He's in
			Engineering...
			Acknowledged, Commander.
			Data -- I want you to stall
			Danar. Allow him to think he's
			succeeding.
			As he bypasses each subsystem,
			I can reroute it without his
			knowledge.
			Make it so.
			Danar is extremely adept, sir.
			I am not certain which security
			measure he is attempting to
			circumvent.
			Sir, Danar has succeeded in
			restoring power to Shuttlebay Two.
			I have overridden Danar's bypass;
			Shuttlebay Two is once again
			inactive.
			Very good, Mister Data. And now
			we know where he's headed.
			He surprised us... came out of
			nowhere. I didn't know anyone
			could move that fast...
			Lieutenant, I am reading an open
			access panel... K-twelve, deck
			thirty.
			Acknowledged.
			Danar must have climbed the
			reactor core and gotten into a
			Jefferies tube. He could be
			anywhere.
			We believe he is attempting to
			reach Shuttlebay Two.
			That's twenty-five decks up from
			here... quite a climb... but I
			wouldn't put it past him...
			There is a full contingent of
			security waiting at all
			shuttlebays.
			You want my advice... double it.
			Reading another open access
			panel...
			Security team to Jefferies tube
			J-four, deck fifteen.
			Security acknowledges. On our
			way.
			Deck fifteen. Only a few decks
			below the shuttlebay.
			Captain, I find it highly unlikely
			that Danar is attempting to reach
			Shuttlebay Two.
			Explain.
			In our previous encounter, Danar
			employed a strategy of
			misdirection in an attempt to gain
			his objective.
			And you believe he's using the
			same tactic now.
			He is aware that our sensors are
			unable to track him. Yet he seems
			to be purposely leaving a trail
			for us to follow.
			And where do you think he's
			headed.
			I am afraid his true destination
			remains a mystery.
			Captain, readings now indicate
			an open access panel... Jeffries
			tube N-eleven, deck thirty-eight.
			He doubled back on us.
			The cargo bays?
			Advise personnel on deck
			thirty-eight to stay out of all
			Cargo Bays.
			They would appear to be empty,
			sir.
			Good. I want you to flood them
			with Anastazine.
			Sensors show Anestazine
			concentration of seventy parts
			per million within the cargo
			bays.
			That should have put our boy to
			sleep.
			Restore normal environmental
			conditions, Mister Data.
			Move in security teams, Mister
			Worf.
			Acknowledged.
			Worf to bridge. We have found no
			sign of the intruder. But there is
			a pressure suit missing from Cargo
			Bay Three.
			A pressure suit...
			Could be he's planning to enter
			Shuttlebay Two from outside the
			Enterprise... bypassing the
			security guards.
			Mister Worf --
			Post security guards at all
			emergency airlocks on decks
			thirty-seven through thirty-nine...
			Aye, sir. I'll also cover the
			photon torpedo launchers... Danar
			may attempt to leave the ship that
			way. Worf out.
			You are cunning, Danar... you must
			have Klingon blood. But the
			battle is over.
			My battle is never over.
			Worf to bridge. I have Danar...
			Explosion in Jefferies Tube
			section T-nine-five. All external
			sensors are inoperative.
			Go to backup systems.
			Unable to transfer control...
			Worf to bridge. Danar has
			escaped. He used a phaser to
			power the cargo transporter.
			Coordinates indicate he beamed
			aboard the Angosian transport
			ship.
			Data, can you verify that?
			Negative. External sensors are
			still nonfunctioning.
			Then we have no way to track him.
			That was his plan all along.
			First officer's log, supplemental.
			We are continuing to repair damage
			to the ship's sensors following
			the escape of the Angosian
			prisoner Danar. He is still at
			large.
			Engineering, I'm getting readings
			at Tactical, are we back up...
			That's affirmative, Commander.
			Sweep the area, Mister Worf...
			Captain, the prime minister is
			hailing us, priority one...
			On screen.
			Yes, Prime Minister.
			Captain, I've just been informed
			that Roga Danar has attacked the
			penal colony on Lunar Five...
			Attacked it... ?
			In our own police shuttle.
			Several of my people are wounded.
			Hundreds of prisoners are rioting.
			Some of them have escaped with
			Danar. We have reports they are
			headed for the capitol city...
			Captain, we are not suited to
			handle situations like this...
			that's why we created them...
			We'll send an away team, Prime
			Minister... Picard out.
			Counselor Troi, Mister Data,
			Lieutenant Worf... you will
			accompany me to the planet...
			My understanding is that these
			men were programmed to survive,
			is that correct?
			Yes, Captain.
			And they will not kill unless
			their survival is at stake?
			It is against their nature to do
			so, Captain.
			Then let us hope they do not
			believe their survival is at
			stake.
			Mister Worf, you are personally
			responsible for the captain's
			safety.
			I understand, Commander.
			I do not expect them to listen
			to reason... I loathe the idea
			of a violent confrontation, but
			we must be prepared...
			This is all you've brought... ?
			Where are your security men... ?
			We're not here to fight your wars,
			Prime Minister...
			They've been seen moving toward
			the center of the city... people
			are scared, Captain... don't you
			understand... ? They're dangerous.
			You are dangerous. They are only
			victims.
			You made them what they are. You
			asked them to defend your way of
			life... then you discarded them.
			They were not happy here...
			They were not welcome here.
			It was the will of the people to
			resettle them...
			Nobody was pleased with the
			solution, Captain... but we had
			to act for the greater good...
			Prime Minister, if you have the
			skills to create a master
			soldier, can you not contradict
			the effect... ?
			The chemicals can be removed from
			their systems. But we're not
			convinced the psychological
			conditioning can be entirely
			reversed.
			Have you tried?
			We've studied it thoroughly...
			even before the training began,
			we knew there would be problems
			reversing it. It was a risk we
			had to take.
			Did you reveal that "risk" to the
			men who volunteered for service?
			We were helping them to survive the,
			war, don't you understand? They
			needed these skills...
			They are your sons, your brothers.
			And you have turned your backs on
			them.
			There are methods of treatment...
			until you try them, you can't know
			if they will work. Even a partial
			recovery would give them some
			peace...
			It was the will of the people...
			To allow them to suffer?
			There was a referendum. The
			people weighed the costs involved.
			They chose the resettlement
			solution.
			Besides, we may need to use them
			again some day.
			Unless you are prepared to die,
			I'd suggest you put that down.
			Do as he says.
			Shoot us. Destroy us. Do what
			you have to do. But, by God, you
			will no longer ignore us.
			Danar, it appears to me that you
			are deliberately attempting to
			provoke a response... so you may
			justify your own attack on men
			who do not wish to fight...
			Cowards...
			Yes...
			But you are not programmed to
			murder cowards... and if they will
			not fight back, what will you
			do?
			We will not go back...
			You are programmed to survive...
			you can survive at the Lunar Five
			settlement...
			Survival is not enough... to exist
			is not enough...
			Roga, tell them what you want.
			We want our lives back. We want
			to come home.
			I'm not prepared to negotiate
			under a threat, Danar... but if
			you will put down your arms and
			return peacefully to Lunar Five...
			I would be willing...
			Mister Prime Minister. Our
			respects, sir. But you'll have
			to force us... or try to.
			Captain, you must do something,
			call your ship...
			You're quite right, Prime
			Minister.
			Enterprise, prepare to beam the
			away team back.
			At your command, Captain.
			You can't leave us like this,
			Picard.
			We have everything we need for
			our report. Your prisoner has
			been returned to you. You have
			a decision to make... either try
			to force them back or welcome them
			home. In your own words, this
			is not our affair. We cannot
