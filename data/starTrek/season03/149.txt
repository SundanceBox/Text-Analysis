			Captain, Doctor, I am honored by
			your presence, but may I suggest
			you attend the second concert.
			Why, Data?
			Ensign Ortiz will perform the
			violin part. My rendition will
			be less enjoyable.
			Oh?
			While I am quite proficient
			Technically, according to my
			fellow performers, I lack soul.
			Data, telling us why you're going
			to fail before you make the
			attempt is never wise.
			But is not honesty always the
			preferred choice?
			Excessive honesty can be
			disastrous... particularly in a
			commander.
			Indeed?
			Knowing your limitations is one
			thing. Advertising them to a crew
			can damage your ability to lead.
			Because you lose their respect?
			No, because you may begin to
			believe in those limitations
			yourself.
			Captain, we're receiving a message
			from the Sheliak Corporate.
			Origin point of the message
			confirmed. It is from the Shelia
			star system.
			The Sheliak have not attempted
			to communicate with the Federation
			for a hundred and eleven years.
			On screen.
			Federation creatures, there are
			humans on the fifth planet of Tau
			Cygna. This planet was ceded
			to the corporate in section one
			hundred and thirty-three,
			paragraph seventy-seven of the
			Treaty of Armens. We will begin
			settlement of this world in four
			days. Remove the humans.
			What the devil --
			Federation creatures, there are
			humans on the fifth planet --
			Cancel message.
			Tau Cygna Five is in the de Laure
			belt -- heavy concentrations of
			hyperonic radiation.
			Humans can't survive in such an
			environment. Exposure to
			hyperonic radiation is fatal.
			Then the Sheliak are asking us
			to chase ghosts.
			No, Number One. The Sheliak
			haven't broken a century of
			silence to send us after phantoms.
			An investigation is in order.
			Set course for Tau Cygna Five.
			Human life form readings from the
			planet.
			So, the Sheliak weren't
			hallucinating.
			Numbers?
			Impossible to get an accurate
			reading, Captain. The high
			radiation levels are disrupting
			our sensors.
			Hyperonic radiation also
			interferes with ship's
			transporters; they are now
			inoperable.
			So are the ship's phasers.
			How can humans survive down there?
			They must have found a way to
			adapt.
			Milan's work in radiation
			sensitivity suggests it's
			possible. Perhaps with extensive
			virotherapy...
			Until they found the answer, their
			mortality rate must have been
			staggering.
			Well, whoever they are and however
			they've survived, we've got to
			get them off the planet.
			By treaty, this world does belong
			to the Sheliak...
			... who are within their rights
			to demand the removal of these
			"trespassers."
			And if we don't remove them, the
			Sheliak will.
			How forcefully?
			To the Sheliak, humans are a lower
			life form. They'd have no
			compunctions about exterminating
			the intruders.
			Mister Data. As you are unaffected
			by hyperonic radiation, you will
			go to the planet via shuttlecraft
			and commence evacuation
			procedures.
			Aye, sir.
			Any speculation as to what he'll
			find, Number One?
			A lost survey ship would be my
			guess. A dozen or so survivors
			at most.
			A shuttlecraft!
			Where's it from?
			Look at the markings. I think
			it's from the Federation.
			Hello.
			We saw your ship... You're the
			first visitor we've had in...
			The first visitor we've ever had.
			You're -- not human.
			That is correct. I am an android.
			I am Lieutenant Commander Data
			of the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			Our great-grandparents were
			citizens of the Federation.
			But you don't want to waste time
			talking to us...
			You'll want to speak with
			Gosheven. We'll take you to him.
			Excellent.
			I'm sure the Federation will be
			very proud of us. Wait until you
			see all we've accomplished.
			And who, precisely, is "we?"
			You don't know? No, I guess you
			wouldn't, would you? We are the
			descendants of the original
			settlers -- from the colony ship
			Artemis.
			Got it. The Artemis, launched one
			hundred forty-two years ago,
			destination Septimis Minor. When
			they failed to check in, Starfleet
			began an extensive search.
			What carried the Artemis so far
			off course?
			My local informant does not know.
			In the early days survival on Tau
			Cygna Five was more important than
			history.
			Understood. How many are there?
			Approximately fifteen thousand.
			We've only got three days.
			Without working transporters, we
			couldn't have them out in time.
			Shuttles?
			Loading all the Enterprise
			shuttlecraft to capacity --
			evacuation would take four weeks,
			four days.
			Then we need more time. Mister
			Data, prepare the colonists for
			an evacuation.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf, get me the Sheliak.
			Their home world is quite distant,
			Captain. This will take some
			time.
			Gosheven, look what's come --
			Lieutenant Commander Data of the
			Starship Enterprise.
			He's an android.
			So he is.
			Well, you're here -- what do you
			want?
			My mission is to prepare this
			colony for evacuation.
			Why?
			Because this planet belongs to
			the Sheliak.
			And just who is this Sheliak?
			The term is plural. The Sheliak
			are an intelligent, non-humanoid
			life form, classification R-3 --
			This colony's been here for a
			hundred and forty years -- and
			no one's ever seen a Sheliak.
			I'd say that makes Tau Cygna
			Five our planet. (ALTERNATE:
			ninety years)
			But the original destination of
			the Artemis was Septimis Minor.
			The guidance systems on the
			Artemis failed -- and sent them
			off course. Far off course.
			Our ancestors were lucky to find
			any place to land.
			And when they did, the radiation
			started killing them.
			Hyperonic radiation took the lives
			of a third of the colonists before
			they learned they could adapt
			to it.
			But the colony survived -- and
			prospered.
			Look around. We've brought
			water to the desert, built a
			community.
			Your accomplishments are indeed
			remarkable. However, the
			Sheliak and the Federation
			have a treaty that clearly makes
			this planet Sheliak domain.
			Then change the treaty.
			That may not be possible. The
			Sheliak wish to colonize this
			planet, and they are unwilling
			to share it with humans.
			If you are still here when the
			Sheliak colony ship arrives,
			they will eradicate you.
			They would kill us all?
			They have little regard for
			human life. Thus, our most
			sensible course is to prepare a
			contingency plan for the
			evacuation of your people.
			We're not evacuating.
			Perhaps I have not made myself
			clear.
			Yes, you have. Now let me be
			equally clear. There's going
			to be no evacuation.
			You've delivered your message --
			so go back to your ship. I have
			work to do.
			Nice catch. Wonderful reflexes.
			Sorry to test you like that --
			but I was curious.
			Found a new toy, have we, Ardy?
			Toy? This is the most incredible
			android I've ever seen.
			Have you seen many?
			Actually, no. You're the first.
			Only you would get this excited
			over a walking calculator.
			He's more interesting than
			anything else walking around
			here...
			Depends on what you find
			interesting.
			Cybernetic intelligence fascinates
			me. Are your neural pathways
			duotronic?
			No -- they are positronic.
			I didn't know that was possible!
			What's your memory capacity? How
			many operations per second? I
			have a million questions...
			I am afraid I have no time to
			answer one million questions.
			I have a mission to accomplish.
			I need to know more about your
			people, and Gosheven seems
			unwilling to talk to me further.
			I'm Ard'rian McKenzie. Perhaps
			I can help you.
			Gentlemen, we're giving you an
			assignment, and the one thing we
			don't want to hear is that it is
			impossible.
			I need the transporters to
			function despite the hyperonic
			radiation.
			Impossi -- Yes, sir.
			Even if we can get the Sheliak
			to talk to us, they're not likely
			to be accommodating.
			Captain, when the treaty was
			negotiated the Federation sent
			three hundred and seventy-two
			legal experts. What have we got?
			Thee... and me.
			No response.
			Try again. Boost signal strength.
			Sheliak Corporate. This is the
			Starship Enterprise. Respond
			please.
			Conversation is neither required
			nor desired.
			Conversation is necessary if we
			are to find a solution to our
			mutual problem.
			Our involvement in Federation
			illegality is not indicated.
			Both parties are involved, sir.
			Remove the humans from the Tau
			Cygna system. Three Earth days
			remain.
			Their culture is extremely formal,
			almost ritualistic. An apology
			might smooth matters.
			I apologize for our inadvertent
			violation of the treaty.
			Acknowledged and accepted. Now
			remove the human creatures.
			Let us negotiate in good faith...
			Negotiate to what purpose? The
			treaty is signed.
			There is a thriving colony on the
			planet. Rather than uproot these
			people may I offer a compromise?
			Denied.
			Why?!
			The law is paramount. We are
			entitled.
			This is not a law. It is a
			treaty. It is designed to smooth
			relations between peoples. Not
			to act as a strait...
			... jacket.
			... you really think we'll have
			to leave Tau Cygna Five?
			The possibility exists, and
			Gosheven appears unwilling to
			prepare for it. Why?
			Maybe because you're an
			android. I don't think Gosheven
			likes the idea of machines
			ordering him around.
			I am not ordering him to do
			anything; I am merely trying to
			persuade him that his people
			should prepare to evacuate.
			Do you believe my suggested
			course of action should be followed?
			Of course.
			In spite of the fact that I am
			an android?
			Because of that fact. I don't
			have any silly prejudices against
			computers -- I like them.
			Not that any computer we have is
			half as sophisticated as you...
			No, I would say not.
			People can be selfish,
			irrational, stubborn, malicious
			-- you name it. But computers
			don't have those failings.
			You conclude from this that I am
			impartial... hence you accept
			my recommendations.
			Yet Gosheven does not.
			Perhaps he might reconsider his
			position if someone other than
			myself were to present the
			arguments.
			Well, I'm willing to talk to him,
			but I don't think he'll take me
			seriously.
			He finds me attractive -- but I'm
			not interested in him at all.
			So he belittles me to protect his
			ego --
			Data, here.
			The Sheliak won't bargain.
			Understood.
			I'm contacting Starfleet to
			arrange for transport. Get those
			people prepared for evacuation.
			We may have to move very quickly.
			Yes, sir.
			We must speak with Gosheven
			immediately.
			Gentlemen, how are you coming?
			What the hell is that?
			Our first attempt.
			We recalibrated the transporter
			setting for the tightest possible
			beam.
			But we've got plenty of things
			left to try.
			There's some really interesting
			residue . . . reminds me of --
			There's that damn pulsar in the
			neighborhood.
			Teremi-thorons.
			This just got a lot harder.
			They're one of the most elusive
			sub-atomic particles known, and
			they really shred a transporter
			signal.
			Thank you, Ensign, I passed
			physics.
			Keep at it. We need those
			transporters.
			We're going to have a lot of fun
			cracking this one.
			See that? Do you have any idea
			what it is? What it means?
			It is water, a substance composed
			of two atoms of hydrogen --
			It's not water. It's blood and
			sweat -- the result of a hundred
			and forty years of combined
			effort. (ALTERNATE: ninety
			years) This isn't a town.
			It's a monument to every man,
			woman, and child who has lived
			and died on Tau Cygna Five.
			Gosheven, you're talking nonsense.
			Am I? My grandfather's buried
			on that mountain.
			He died in a rock slide surveying
			the route for this aqueduct. This
			colony exists because of his
			sacrifice, and the sacrifices of
			thousands of others. No, we're
			not leaving.
			The Sheliak will not accept humans
			on their planet. And they will
			not hesitate to use force to
			remove you.
			And we will not hesitate to fight
			back.
			You cannot win.
			You just don't understand, do you?
			We will not be bullied off our
			land... not by you, and not by
			the Sheliak.
			Stubborn and irrational. Now what
			do we do?
			Are his sentiments typical among
			the colonists?
			I hope not. Are you thinking
			of bypassing Gosheven and taking
			your case directly to the people?
			I see no other course of action.
			If I can convince enough people
			of the necessity of leaving --
			Don't you mean "if we can
			convince?"
			You are offering assistance?
			Yes, sir?
			Three weeks. Starfleet is profuse
			in their apologies, but it will
			still be three weeks.
			Until?
			Until the arrival of a colony
			transport ship equipped with
			dedicated personnel shuttles.
			We can't wait three weeks.
			The Sheliak must agree to extend
			our deadline.
			If they plan to settle Tau Cygna
			Five two days from now...
			... one of their ships must already
			be en route.
			We're going to intercept that
			ship.
			The Sheliak may interpret that
			as a hostile act.
			We have to take the risk.
			The Enterprise is going to try
			to intercept the Sheliak colony
			ship. Your job ... well, you know
			your job.
			Commander, in human parlance, I do
			not believe I can "get the job
			done." My training has prepared
			me for starship command duties.
			As a cultural contact I am
			proving to be less than exemplary.
			What's the situation?
			Their leader has rejected my
			counsel. He denies the logic of
			my arguments and talks of
			structures they have built.
			Then try something else.
			I have. In the last three hours
			and eight minutes, I have spoken
			to fifty-six colonists. Ten
			refused to believe a threat
			exists. Twenty-two favored
			staying and fighting the Sheliak.
			I don't have time for this.
			Sixteen preferred negotiation or
			some form of passive resistance.
			Only eight were willing to
			consider evacuation. And of those
			eight --
			Data, I can't help you -- I don't
			know these people; I haven't
			talked to them. You have. Use
			that fancy positronic brain of
			yours -- and carry out your
			mission.
			If I do not succeed, how violent
			is the Sheliak reaction likely
			to be?
			The treaty is the only thing which
			kept them from eradicating the
			colony the moment they discovered
			it.
			Ah.
			"Ah" is right. The lives of
			fifteen thousand people are riding
			on you. You'd better get
			innovative. Riker out.
			Data -- we're having an effect.
			So many people are asking
			questions about the Sheliak that
			Gosheven's called a public
			meeting.
			Is there any indication that
			Gosheven has changed his position?
			No. But a meeting will give you
			the chance to present your
			recommendations.
			First, will Gosheven allow me to
			speak? Second, even if he does,
			what good will it do? So far,
			my attempts at persuasion have
			been ineffective.
			Why did you do that?
			You appeared to need it.
			Among humans, a kiss normally
			serves to seal a friendship or
			to indicate support, attraction,
			affection.
			In this context, I would assume
			your intention was to express
			support.
			That was my primary motivation.
			You don't really understand human
			behavior, do you?
			That is something of an
			understatement.
			Sometimes I don't either.
			androids are a lot more rational.
			Thus far, that quality has not
			helped me accomplish my mission.
			A rational argument isn't always
			enough. Maybe to be more
			persuasive, you need to use a
			little reverse psychology.
			Elicit a desired behavior by
			advocating its opposite?
			That implies deception, does it
			not?
			A little. But if it helps us
			get our point across...
			Perhaps this is a situation in
			which excessive honesty is
			detrimental.
			How are we progressing, Mister
			La Forge?
			About like you'd expect.
			Splendid.
			He wants the impossible.
			That's the short definition for
			"captain."
			You've all heard about the android
			Starfleet sent here, and you've
			been discussing why he's come.
			I called this meeting to replace
			misinformation with cold, hard
			fact.
			Leave. Immediately.
			I wish to speak.
			No.
			You deny me the opportunity to
			address the assemblage?
			This meeting is not for outsiders.
			Do you consider your position so
			weak that it cannot withstand
			debate?
			Let him talk.
			You know of the Sheliak threat.
			Starfleet wishes to evacuate you
			for your own protection.
			Gosheven has decided otherwise.
			That is his right. And I will
			not waste time trying to reverse
			that decision.
			I admire your conviction in the
			face of certain defeat. Your
			effort will be valiant, though
			doomed. Still, when you die,
			you will die for land and honor.
			Your children will understand that
			they are dying for a worthy cause.
			Long after the battle is over,
			their courage will be remembered
			and extolled.
			Remembered by who?
			Ah, that is true. There will be
			no one left alive to remember.
			A valiant try, android, but what
			a low opinion you must have of
			us.
			I was simply attempting to
			describe your inevitable
			destruction in a manner that
			would have an emotional effect.
			And he did it pretty damned well.
			Are you ready to follow this
			machine, Haritath? Give up
			everything? Without a fight?
			He says we're going to lose, I
			think that's his own cowardice
			talking!
			And what if he's right, and you're
			wrong? Shouldn't we consider that
			possibility?
			We may be sacrificing ourselves
			for nothing --
			Last winter we buried your little
			girl -- laid her to rest next to
			your mother, and you dare speak
			of sacrifice?
			And you, Kentor, we built you
			a new house after the fire wiped
			you out. Can you simply walk away
			from that?
			Better to walk away than to be
			annihilated.
			This colony exists because
			generations gave their lives for
			it. Many people died before we
			found a way to adapt to the
			radiation. Many more died
			bringing water to the desert.
			My father --
			-- is buried on that mountain.
			Well, who's going to be left to
			bury you?
			Have you considered what this
			evacuation means? Everything we
			have, we abandon. Everything
			we've built turns into dust.
			Everything we've accomplished
			means nothing.
			Well, I say NO! You elected me
			to be your leader -- follow me
			now! I don't think our chances
			are as hopeless as he says. And
			I'm willing to stake our lives
			on it. Any objections?
			Good, because here... we...
			stand.
			Then here you die.
			Maybe if we bypassed the autosequence
			and decompiled the
			pattern buffer... ?
			It's no crazier than anything
			else we've tried.
			Ensign Crusher.
			Yes, sir.
			If you ever touch my transporter
			again... I'll kill you.
			Sorry, sir.
			Mister Data -- I want to tell you
			that... well, Gosheven doesn't
			speak for all of us.
			I see no point in dying
			needlessly.
			And you, Kentor?
			I'm not sure. Gosheven has done
			well for us. But I'd like to hear
			more of what you have to say.
			There are many others that feel
			the same way but are uneasy about
			confronting Gosheven.
			Get them together. We'll meet
			at my house.
			In our dealings with other
			non-humanoid races there has been
			some point of reference; not so
			with the Sheliak.
			We must have something in common.
			We communicate.
			Barely. The Sheliak have learned
			several Federation languages, but
			theirs continues to elude us.
			Telepaths?
			Attempted and failed.
			This is ludicrous!
			No, sir, the fact that any alien
			race communicates with another
			is quite remarkable.
			We are stranded on a planet. No
			language in common, but I want
			to teach you mine.
			S'smarith. What did I just say?
			Cup? Glass?
			Are you sure? I might have meant
			liquid, clear, brown, hot. And
			we conceptualize the universe in
			relatively the same way.
			Point taken.
			During your talks you must be
			extremely accurate. The treaty
			is 500,000 words. The length was
			to accommodate the Sheliak. They
			consider our language irrational,
			and demanded this level of
			complexity to avoid any future
			misunderstandings.
			Captain, we have the vessel
			carrying the Sheliak colonists
			on visual.
			On my way.
			So it begins.
			Open hailing frequencies. This
			is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Starship Enterprise.
			Your purpose, Enterprise?
			We desire face-to-face negotiation
			to settle the crisis on Tau Cygna
			Five.
			We are entitled to consultation
			under paragraph five hundred and
			sixty-three subparagraph nine.
			Granted.
			Was that an invitation?
			I'm going to take it as such.
			Number One, you have the bridge.
			Helm, maintain relative position.
			Mister Worf, have Transporter Room
			Two stand by.
			Aye, sir.
			... and once the Federation
			resettles us, we'll be left
			alone?
			If you so desire.
			We do. We like doing things on
			our own.
			The Federation will offer as
			little or as much help as you
			dictate.
			Kentor -- are you with us?
			Yes.
			The question is, how do we
			convince Gosheven?
			Why do we need to?
			Because he's respected. Most
			people will do as he says.
			The people respect you, too.
			If you take a stand, they'll
			fall in line.
			I don't know. Gosheven's got a
			lot of supporters...
			Don't forget that, Kentor.
			I'm disappointed. I thought we
			had settled this.
			Apparently, that is not correct.
			Still stirring up trouble?
			Since when is talk trouble?
			It's over. Don't you get it?
			You had your say, and you lost.
			I appear to be reversing that
			defeat.
			No, you're not -- you're just
			stubborn.
			Well, let me tell you something...
			... so am I.
			Damn you, Gosheven --
			You killed him?
			I've killed no one.
			I've merely shut down a machine.
			That's it, everyone. Time to
			go home.
			You'll see I'm right.
			Advance and speak.
			Director, we will comply with your
			request to remove the colony on
			Tau Cygna Five, but we need time.
			The given time has elapsed. We
			carry the membership and we will
			proceed with their debarkation.
			The temporary presence of these
			humans should not interfere
			with your plans.
			Unacceptable. You must remove
			the creatures.
			I'm trying! But the needed ship
			won't be available for three
			weeks.
			Then you are in violation.
			I have admitted that! I'm only
			asking for a little tolerance.
			Section five hundred and one,
			paragraph seven hundred and
			sixteen, subparagraph five --
			unwanted lifeforms inhabiting H
			class worlds may be removed at
			the discretion of the Sheliak
			corporate.
			We will remove them. But you
			must grant us the time we require.
			You need time, Picard of the
			Enterprise, we will save you time.
			We will eradicate the human
			infestation.
			They are not vermin! They are
			citizens of the Federation and
			I will not permit this travesty!
			Intelligent converse is
			impossible. You do not discuss,
			you gibber.
			Between intelligent species of
			good will --
			I take it the Sheliak just hung
			up on us. Again.
			I was afraid your neural pathways
			were scrambled beyond repair.
			I am equipped with diagnostic
			circuits and can correct many
			malfunctions.
			I'm not surprised at Gosheven's
			behavior. But Kentor and the
			others... they said they were
			on our side.
			I guess words don't mean very
			much.
			Perhaps that has been part of our
			difficulty. Words are all we have
			been using.
			Humans seem to take much stronger
			notice of actions.
			I require a phaser.
			What's a phaser?
			A type of weapon. Unfortunately
			it will not function in the
			presence of hyperonic radiation.
			I will have to be innovative.
			Hyperonic radiation randomizes
			phaser beams. But I believe I
			can improvise a servocircuit which
			will compensate by continuously
			recollimating the output.
			You're using your own neural
			subprocessors to build a smarter
			phaser.
			Essentially correct.
			Get word to Gosheven. Tell him
			I am coming to the pumping
			station. Tell him I am going
			to destroy the aqueduct.
			He'll try to stop you --
			I sincerely hope so.
			Go to Yellow Alert. Shields up.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Riker, put us nose to nose
			with the Sheliak ship. If she
			makes a move, match it.
			Aye, sir.
			Open a hailing frequency.
			They're not responding, sir.
			They don't have to answer. They
			just have to listen! Sheliak
			vessel, you will have to go
			through me to get at the colony
			on Tau Cygna Five!
			No response.
			Close channel -- and get me that
			treaty! They've been beating us
			over the head with it for three
			days. Let's see if we can't find
			something in it that can be
			turned to our advantage.
			We're going to try to beat them
			at their own game?
			The treaty is how long?
			Five hundred thousand words.
			We are going to regret Data's
			absence.
			That was the "stun" setting.
			This is not.
			I could reduce this pumping
			station to a pile of debris...
			but I trust my point is clear.
			I am one android with a single
			weapon. There are hundreds of
			Sheliak on the way... and their
			weapons are far more powerful.
			And the Sheliak may not even offer
			you a target. They can obliterate
			this colony from orbit. You will
			die never having seen the faces
			of your killers.
			The choice is yours.
			There are other places -- other
			challenges. It's time to move
			on.
			I really was willing to stay and
			die for this.
			I know that, but it is just a
			thing, and things can be replaced.
			Lives cannot. Live, rebuild and
			be remembered.
			This is hopeless. Fighting would
			be preferable.
			That's it.
			I don't follow you, sir.
			Worf, get me the Sheliak.
			Yes, sir!
			Pursuant to paragraph one thousand
			two hundred and ninety I formally
			request third party arbitration
			of our dispute.
			Agreed.
			And further, pursuant to
			subsection D, three, I name the
			Grizzelas to arbitrate.
			Grizzelas?
			Grizzelas?
			Unfortunately they are currently
			in their hibernation cycle, but
			they'll awaken in six months, and
			then we'll get this matter
			settled. Now, do you want to
			wait... or give me my three weeks?
			Absurd. We carry the membership!
			We can brook no delay!
			Then I declare the treaty in
			abeyance!
			Wait! Negotiation is --
			You enjoyed that.
			You're damn right.
			Captain, they are hailing us.
			Sir?
			On screen.
			You may have your three weeks,
			Picard of the Enterprise.
			Thank you.
			Captain, we can do it! We can
			modify the transporters.
			Excellent.
			It'll take fifteen years, and a
			research team of a hundred --
			Mister La Forge, I believe we will
			postpone.
			Yes, sir.
			Commander Data to Enterprise.
			I am preparing to leave Tau Cygna
			Five and await rendezvous
			instructions.
			Acknowledged. Stand by.
			Hi.
			Hello, Ard'rian.
			The evacuation plan is going well.
			When the transport ship arrives,
			we'll be ready.
			You succeeded.
			I would not have succeeded without
			your support and insight, and I
			appreciate your assistance.
			Good. Then you won't forget me?
			I am incapable of forgetting.
			I will remember every detail of
			my visit with perfect clarity.
			But nothing more?
			I do not understand.
			I guess what I really want to know
			is -- do you have any feelings
			for me?
			I have no feelings of any kind.
			No. Of course you don't.
			What was that for?
			You appeared to require it.
			You observed I was unhappy and
			did what you concluded would make
			me feel better. A purely rational
			deduction.
			Have I disappointed you?
			No, I'm disappointed in myself
			-- for wanting something I know
			I can't have.
			Data, in so many ways you're
			superior to humans. But you are
			still a machine... without
			emotion.
			Yes.
			It's so easy to believe otherwise.
			It's so easy to read things into
			your behavior... and perceive
			feelings where none exist.
			Well, I am human and I do have
			feelings... silly though they may
			be at times. I like you, Data.
			You're my favorite android.
			But I am the only android you have
			ever met.
			Rational to the last.
			Come.
			Welcome home, Mister Data. Well
			done.
			Thank you, sir.
			The good doctor was kind enough
			to provide me with a recording
			of your concert. Your
			performance shows a good deal
			of feeling.
			As I have lately had to remind
			others, I have no feelings.
			That's hard to believe; your
			playing is quite beautiful.
			Strictly speaking, it is not
			"my" playing. It is a precise
			imitation of the techniques of
			Jascha Heifetz and Trenka Bron-Ken.
			And is there nothing of Data in
			what I'm hearing?
			You chose the violinists.
			Heifetz and Bron-Ken had
			radically different styles, but
			you combined them -- successfully.
			I suppose I have learned to be
			innovative... when necessary, sir.
			Mister Data... I look forward to
			your next concert.
