			Try this.
			What is it?
			Just try it.
			It's an Earth drink... prune
			juice.
			A warrior's drink.
			You're always drinking alone.
			It wouldn't hurt you to look for
			a little...
			...companionship.
			I would require a Klingon woman
			for... companionship. Human
			females are too fragile.
			Not all of them... I know one or
			two on board who might find you
			a bit tame...
			Impossible.
			You never know until you try...
			Then I will never know.
			Coward...
			I am merely concerned for the
			safety of my crewmates.
			Drink your prune juice.
			Lieutenant Worf, report to the
			bridge.
			On my way, sir.
			Analysis, Mister Data.
			Sensors are reading gravimetric
			fluctuations... most unusual
			ones.
			"Unusual" how? Specify?
			Nothing I have seen before.
			Is it a wormhole?
			Yes... and no. Like a... time
			displacement, but it does not have
			a discernible event horizon.
			Sir, navigational subsystems are
			unable to give coordinates on the
			object.
			Confirmed. The phenomenon does
			not have a definable center or
			outer edge.
			Are you saying it is... and yet
			it isn't there?
			I do not have sufficient
			information to make an analysis
			as yet, Commander. The dynamics
			of the radiation patterns---
			Something's happening, Captain.
			A new change in sensor readings.
			No...
			Mister Data?
			Can you identify the ship,
			Lieutenant? Is it an enemy
			vessel?
			I'm getting too much interference,
			Captain.
			It's clearing, Captain.
			Definitely a Federation
			starship... accessing registry...
			Looks like they had a rough ride.
			N, C, C, one-seven-oh-one... C.
			U.S.S.... Enterprise.
			Military log, Combat-date
			43625.2. While investigating an
			unusual radiation anomaly reported
			by Starbase one oh five, the
			Enterprise has encountered what
			could almost be called a ghost
			from its own past... The
			Enterprise-C, the immediate
			predecessor of this battleship.
			Sensors confirm design and
			specifications, Captain. Analysis
			of hull and engine materials
			conform to engineering patterns
			and methods of that time period.
			But that cruiser was destroyed
			with all hands about twenty years
			ago.
			Presumed destroyed. The
			Enterprise-C was last seen near
			the Klingon outpost on Narendra
			Three exactly twenty-two years,
			four months and three days ago.
			And now it's here.
			Mister Data, is it possible...
			that it has... traveled through
			time?
			It is a possibility, Captain.
			If that is the correct hypothesis,
			then the phenomenon we just
			enountered was a temporal rift
			in space.
			A rift?
			Possibly the formation of a Kerr
			loop from superstring material...
			it would require high-energy
			interactions occuring in the
			vicinity for such a structure to
			form. The rift is certainly not
			stable, Captain. It could
			collapse at any time.
			I'm able to scan the interior of
			the ship now, sir... heavy damage
			to warp field nacelles and hull
			bearing struts... internal space
			frame --
			Life-signs, Captain!
			Readings are sporadic... looks
			like they have massive casualties,
			but some are still alive.
			Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency
			teams, stand by Transporter Rooms.
			Understood.
			Belay that order, Doctor.
			I respectfully suggest that
			regardless of how they did it,
			they are here now and they need
			our help.
			That ship has traveled into its
			own future. We are dealing with
			variables that could alter the
			flow of our own history.
			But their influence on history
			has ended, sir. That ship
			disappeared from the past
			twenty-two years ago and never
			returned.
			Captain, the Enterprise... C is
			sending out a distress call, sir.
			Audio only.
			This... is Captain Garrett... of
			the Starship Enterprise, to any
			Federation ship. We... have been
			attacked by Romulan warships and
			require... immediate assistance.
			We have lost warp drive...
			life-support is failing.
			We have no record of a Romulan
			assault on the Enterprise-C...
			Voice message has ended, Captain.
			All I'm receiving now is their
			automated distress signal.
			Hailing frequency, Lieutenant.
			This is Captain Picard of... a
			Federation starship. Standby to
			receive emergency teams.
			We'll handle this one step at a
			time. Stabilize power systems
			and attend to their casualties.
			Avoid discussions of where and
			when they are.
			Aye, sir.
			Lieutenant.
			Message coming in from Starfleet
			monitor stations, Captain.
			Klingon battlecruisers have been
			reported moving toward this
			sector.
			Battle alert, Mister Crusher.
			Condition Yellow.
			Aye, sir.
			All decks report Condition Yellow.
			It's changed... it's all
			changed...
			Captain Garrett?
			Yes.
			I'm Commander Riker. We have
			emergency teams boarding your
			ship.
			Doctor.
			The rest of the bridge crew is
			dead.
			Her leg is fractured and she has
			serious internal injuries.
			I'll have to get her back to the
			Enterprise, it's more than I can
			do here.
			To where?
			We'll explain later, Captain.
			You'll explain now, Commander.
			We're from a Federation starship.
			We've answered your distress call.
			Your ship is in good hands, but
			we need to get you to our Sickbay.
			Very well.
			Crusher to Transporter Room. Two
			to beam directly to Sickbay.
			Pretty bad, Commander. Looks like
			they were in a hell of a fight.
			If you can't stabilize
			life-support, we'll have to
			evacuate the ship.
			I think we can do it. I'll have
			to get to Engineering...
			La Forge to damage control team
			alpha. Meet me on Engineering
			level three.
			Thanks...
			I'm Commander Riker.
			Lieutenant Castillo. Helmsman.
			Your Captain has been sent back
			to the Ent--... back to our ship.
			You would appear to be the senior
			officer left aboard.
			So it would appear.
			Away team reporting in, sir.
			On screen, Mister Data.
			Go ahead, Commander
			We've stabilized life support,
			Captain. Mister La Forge is
			working on restoring the main
			power couplings but it'll take
			time. Things are a real mess over
			here.
			Survivors?
			One hundred twenty-five, sir
			Out of seven hundred.
			Recommendation?
			I'd hate to scrap her, sir.
			Starfleet could certainly use
			another ship, even if it is a
			little old.
			Agreed. But we can't stay in this
			area too long.
			You have nine hours. If you can
			get her underway in that time,
			we'll escort her back to Starbase
			one oh five. If not, we'll
			evacuate the survivors and destroy
			the ship.
			Understood, sir.
			Keep me posted, Picard out.
			Guinan... ?
			We need to talk. Now. It's all
			wrong, Captain. This is not the
			way it's supposed to be.
			I don't know...
			You must have some idea how things
			have changed...
			I look at things... at people...
			and they don't feel right.
			What things? What people?
			The bridge...
			What's the matter with it?
			It's not right.
			It's the same bridge, Guinan. It
			hasn't changed.
			I know that. And I also know...
			it's wrong.
			What else?
			Families. There should be
			children here...
			Children? On the Enterprise... ?
			We're at war, Guinan.
			No, we're not.
			I mean, we shouldn't be. This
			is a ship of peace. Not of war.
			Guinan, what you're suggesting...
			It's not a suggestion, Captain.
			And that ship from the past...
			it was not supposed to come here.
			It's got to go back.
			I'm Captain Picard.
			Rachel Garrett. How's my ship?
			Life support systems have been
			restored. Repairs are continuing.
			Where did you come from? We
			weren't picking up any other
			Federation ships in this sector...
			What is the last thing you
			remember?
			We were answering the distress
			signal...
			Distress signal... ?
			You must have heard it. From the
			Klingon outpost, Narendra Three.
			But you didn't... did you?
			I've never seen a Sickbay like
			this... not even on a starbase.
			And your uniforms...
			What ship is this, Captain?
			Please... try to keep still...
			I insist on an answer.
			You are aboard the Enterprise,
			Captain... one-seven-oh-one-D.
			You have come twenty-two years
			into the future.
			Twenty-two years.
			Does my crew know yet?
			No.
			I must tell them... I owe them
			that, Picard...
			If you wish, I will see to it that
			they're informed...
			Is there a reason they should not
			be told?
			I am concerned that if you return
			to your own time with knowledge
			of the future...
			Return? To the battle? We barely
			escaped with our lives. If we
			return, we'll be destroyed.
			Have you any idea how this
			happened?
			There was a fierce volley of
			photon torpedoes... we were hit...
			there was a bright light and
			then... here.
			It is possible your exchange of
			fire was the catalyst for the
			formation of a temporal rift.
			History never recorded your battle
			with the Romulans.
			We were responding to a distress
			call from the Klingon outpost on
			Narendra Three... the Romulans were
			attacking it... we engaged them...
			but there were four warbirds.
			The Narendra Three outpost was
			wiped out.
			It is regrettable you did not
			succeed, Captain. If a Federation
			starship had rescued a Klingon
			outpost... it might have averted
			twenty years of war.
			I'm not getting any kind of ready
			condition on the impulse engines,
			La Forge...
			Acknowledged, Commander... some
			of the engine control processors
			went off-line. And there's
			probably damage to the accelerator
			coils... stand by...
			I just can't quite make myself
			believe it.
			Twenty-two years...
			I'm reading forty percent on
			forward shields... what do you
			have on aft...
			Forty percent...
			That's not going to do...
			Commander, advise Lieutenant La
			Forge that shields are below
			minimum...
			Acknowledged...
			We'll never see our families
			again. Our homes...
			How do you know your family's not
			still alive?
			You're right... I don't... but
			imagine coming home after
			twenty-two years... Would I even
			recognize them?
			What are the status readouts on
			main phaser banks?
			Emitters available -- sixty
			percent forward, fifty-two percent
			aft.
			Let's take a look at the torpedo
			launchers...
			I guess I'm lucky to be alive at
			all.
			You may not like the future. It's
			been a long war. The
			Federation's lost more than half
			of Starfleet to the Klingons.
			We were negotiating a peace treaty
			with the Klingons when I left...
			A lot of changes, Lieutenant.
			A lot of changes.
			When we get a break, maybe you
			could fill me in on some of them.
			Photon banks are depleted...
			auxiliary fusion generators are
			down...
			The probability is high that the
			temporal rift is symmetrical,
			Captain.
			If that is the case, what would
			happen if the Enterprise-C were
			to fly back through it?
			Back, sir? The Enterprise-C would
			emerge in her own time period
			at almost the same instant she
			left.
			Right in the middle of her
			battle with the Romulans.
			Yes, sir.
			Based on the logs of the
			Enterprise-C, is there any
			possibility she could survive that
			battle?
			None, sir.
			Then sending them back would be
			condemning them to death.
			Unbelievable.
			Lieutenant... ?
			She was the first Galaxy Class
			warship built by the Federation...
			forty-two decks... capable of
			transporting over six thousand
			troops...
			How long have you been on board?
			Four years. Straight out of the
			Academy. I was lucky to get the
			Enterprise.
			Yeah, me too. I mean... my
			Enterprise.
			Lieutenant, how's the ship?
			We've restored minimal shields
			and the forward phaser banks.
			Still no photon launchers or warp
			drive.
			Concentrate on the weapon systems.
			From what Captain Picard has told
			me, the Federation can use all
			the help it can get.
			And soon. Our sensors have picked
			up Klingon warships in this
			sector, Captain.
			Why wasn't I informed, Mister
			Castillo... ?
			Captain, you shouldn't --
			As senior officer, I want you to
			be my liaison to the Enterprise-
			D... coordinate with
			Tactical...
			That's me, Captain.
			Where do you think you're going?
			I'm ready to resume my duties.
			Captain, you need at least another
			twenty-four hours...
			Nonsense. Doctors always
			over-protect their patients.
			And captains always push
			themselves too hard.
			Doctor, my ship and crew need me
			-- now. Twenty-four hours might
			as well be twenty-four years.
			I need more.
			There is no more. I wish there
			was, Captain. I wish I could
			prove it. I can't.
			Then I can't send them back.
			You must.
			Dammit, Guinan, they will die
			moments after they return... how
			can I ask them to sacrifice their
			lives based solely on your...
			intuition?
			I don't know.
			This is a mistake. Every cell in
			my body knows this is a mistake.
			I cannot explain it to myself so
			I cannot explain it to you. I...
			just know.
			Who is to say this history is any
			less proper than the other?
			I guess I am.
			Not good enough.
			Not good enough. I will not ask
			them to die.
			Forty billion have died in the
			war...
			I cannot justify readjusting
			history on the basis of saving
			lives in war... shall I return
			to Sarajevo and stop the
			assassination of Archduke
			Ferdinand... or go back to warn
			Station-Salem Four of the Bel-zon
			raid...
			This war was never meant to be.
			They must return to their own
			time to correct that.
			And what is the guarantee that
			by going back they will
			succeed... ?
			In fact, they could conceivably
			create a third time line.
			Yes.
			Every instinct tells me it's wrong
			and dangerous and futile.
			Picard, we have been together for
			twenty-two years. I have been
			your advisor, your confidant, your
			friend and in all those twenty-two
			years, I have never led you
			astray. This time line cannot
			be allowed to continue. I've told
			you what you must do. You have
			only your faith in me to help you
			decide.
			Deflector shield technology has
			advanced considerably during the
			war... our heat-dissipation rates
			are probably double those of the
			Enterprise-C, so we can hang in
			a firefight longer...
			Guinan... ?
			Have you ordered yet, Tasha?
			Not yet... Is something wrong,
			Guinan?
			Not a thing. What can I get you?
			Just a couple of T-K-L meal
			rations... we're in a hurry.
			Oh, this is, Lieutenant
			Castillo...
			First time for everything.
			First time?
			It's just that I've never seen
			anything bother her before...
			What's a T-K-L?
			Standard rations. Food
			replicators are on minimum
			power...
			Everything else is diverted to
			defensive systems.
			So where was I...
			You've told me more about tactical
			in an hour than I learned my last
			year in the Academy...
			You're gonna need it,
			Lieutenant...
			Hey, I've known you a whole day
			now, Lieutenant. I won't salute
			if you won't. What did she call
			you... Tasha?
			Yeah.
			Most everybody just calls me
			Castillo. My mother calls me
			Richard.
			Okay, Castillo.
			Naw, I think maybe I'd like it
			better if you called me Richard...
			Richard.
			This is the captain. Senior
			officers will report to my Ready
			Room immediately.
			So much for lunch.
			Captain, are you suggesting they
			should return and attempt to
			complete their mission?
			I am, Doctor.
			Based on Guinan's intuition... ?
			But it won't accomplish anything.
			There's no way they can save
			Narendra Three...
			Captain Garrett says there were
			four Romulan warbirds. The
			Enterprise-C would be outmanned
			and outgunned...
			Unless we were to re-arm them with
			modern...
			We can't do that. If we send this
			ship back with new technology...
			we would be altering the past...
			But that's what you're talking
			about doing anyway, isn't it?
			Altering the past.
			We're talking about restoring the
			past.
			How could Guinan know that history
			has been altered... if she's been
			altered along with the rest of
			us?
			Perhaps her species has a
			perception that goes beyond linear
			time.
			There are many things about her
			species that cannot be easily
			explained. Even she cannot
			explain how or why she senses that
			history has been altered. And yet
			it is very possible she is correct.
			A ship from the past has traveled
			through time. Who among us could
			know what effect that event has
			had on the present. Indeed, we
			will never know for certain if
			Guinan is correct. But I, for one,
			have decided the consequences of
			that possibility are too grave to
			ignore.
			Sir, if you wish my opinion...
			I think I know your opinion,
			Commander. This is a briefing.
			I'm not seeking your consent.
			With all due respect, Captain,
			we'd be asking one hundred and
			twenty-five people to die a
			meaningless death.
			Not necessarily meaningless,
			Commander. Klingons place honor
			above all else.
			If the crew of the Enterprise-C
			had died fighting for the survival
			of a Klingon outpost, that would
			have been considered a meaningful
			act of honor by the Klingon
			Empire.
			Even their deaths... might have
			prevented the war.
			If the Enterprise-C returns to
			the battle and its mission is a
			success, history will be
			irrevocably changed. This time
			line will cease to exist... and
			a new future will have been
			created.
			I've weighed the alternatives.
			I will follow Guinan's
			recommendations.
			Dismissed.
			If she's right... we may not even
			be in the alternate time line...
			Yeah, who knows if we're dead or
			alive...
			Engineering.
			Is Engineering your destination
			as well?
			Oh... Deck six... sorry...
			If I interpret your facial
			expression correctly, you were
			preoccupied with something
			unpleasant.
			I was just thinking... a lot of
			things...
			I've been working with one of the
			officers from the Enterprise-C...
			he's nice, you know? I like him.
			I'm worried about what's going
			to happen to him.
			We may never know what happens,
			Tasha. If they succeed, we will
			not even realize any of these
			events occurred.
			Data, how different do you think
			your life would be in the other
			time line?
			The possibilities are too numerous
			even for me to calculate, Tasha.
			Kind of scary, isn't it?
			Scary? I would not know.
			Shields are up to seventy-two
			percent... That's better...
			You believe this woman...
			I discovered long ago that she
			has a special wisdom... I've
			learned to trust it.
			If you wish, I can arrange for
			you to speak with her...
			Captain, I'd be lying to you if
			I told you there was a chance in
			hell of coming out of this alive.
			And my crew means a lot to me.
			Why doesn't your ship come back
			with us? The Romulans would be
			no match for your weaponry...
			I can't do that.
			No, I suppose not. You don't
			belong in our time... any more
			than we belong in yours.
			To be honest, Picard, there are
			some members of my crew who have
			expressed a desire to return...
			even knowing the odds. Some
			because they can't bear to live
			without their loved ones... some
			who don't like the idea that we
			slipped out in the middle of a
			fight. But I've told them... that
			in the here and now, the
			Federation needs another ship
			against the Klingons... and we
			better get used to being in the
			here and now...
			By going back, you may be a great
			deal more helpful. The war is
			going badly for the Federation.
			Much worse than is generally known.
			Starfleet Command believes defeat
			is inevitable... that within six
			months we will have no choice but
			to surrender...
			And you're saying all this may
			be a result of our arrival here.
			One more ship will make no
			difference in the here and now,
			Captain. But twenty-two years
			ago, one ship could have stopped
			this war before it ever started.
			Mister Castillo, inform the crew
			that we're going back.
			Yes, Captain.
			The Romulans'll get a good fight.
			We'll make it one for the history
			books.
			I know you will, Captain.
			Lieutenant Yar...
			Permission to remain for a moment,
			sir...
			Granted.
			I just wanted to say good luck...
			I'll try to put some of your
			tactical briefing to good use when
			we get back...
			Your ship has a lot more
			maneuverability than the Romulan
			counterparts of that era... in
			fact, if you could isolate...
			You'll do fine.
			If you get back to Earth... and
			you see a man, oh, in his late
			fifties taking a hard look at you
			across a crowded room...
			Hey, you never know.
			Good-bye, Lieutenant.
			Red Alert. Full power to shields.
			Shields are up. Functioning.
			Initiating evasive maneuvers...
			Gamma sequence.
			Ready phasers...
			Enterprise-D, has your captain
			returned safely...
			Acknowledged, Enterprise-C.
			Captain Picard is safely aboard...
			Fire phasers.
			Firing phasers...
			Situation report...
			One Klingon bird of prey... off
			the starboard bow...
			Firing phasers...
			Load torpedo bays...
			The Klingon vessel has re-cloaked,
			sir. I have no readings.
			Captain Garrett -- damage report.
			Captain Garrett...
			This is Lieutenant Yar, sir.
			Captain Garrett is dead.
			I'm prepared to lead the
			Enterprise back myself, Captain
			Picard.
			Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the
			last senior officer alive... he
			will have limited support from
			Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff
			in Engineering...
			I have good people willing to do
			their best...
			But certainly, history never meant
			this ship to be led into battle
			without your captain.
			I can't speak to that point,
			sir... but I can get us back to
			where we're supposed to be. I
			believe that's what Captain
			Garrett would want me to do.
			Commander Data to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			Sir, sensors are showing
			additional instability in the
			time rift. Possibly the result
			of the battle with the Klingons.
			Any signs of other Klingon
			vessels?
			No, sir.
			I'm sure our coordinates have
			been transmitted to the Klingon
			command... we must not remain
			here.
			Sir, it is my intention to return,
			unless you order me not to.
			How soon will your ship be ready?
			We sustained moderate damage in
			the attack... I think we can get
			underway in a few hours...
			We will maintain position to
			provide cover.
			Make it so.
			One to beam to the Enterprise-C.
			We keep saying good-bye... don't
			we?
			I wish there was more time.
			More time... I think we have all
			the time we can handle as it is.
			Lieutenant.
			What would you like?
			Guinan, I have to know something.
			What happens to me in the other
			time line?
			I don't have alternate biographies
			of the crew, Tasha. I told the
			captain... it's just a feeling...
			But there's something more when
			you look at me, isn't there...
			I've seen it in your eyes, Guinan.
			We've known each other too long...
			We weren't meant to know each
			other at all.
			Or that's what I sense when I look
			at you.
			You're not supposed to be here,
			Tasha.
			Where am I supposed to be?
			Dead.
			Do you know how?
			No.
			But I know that it was an empty
			death. A death without purpose.
			Come.
			Yes, Lieutenant.
			Captain, I request a transfer to
			the Enterprise-C.
			For what reason?
			They need someone at Tactical.
			You're needed here.
			Sir, I don't belong here.
			Sit down.
			What did she tell you?
			I'm not supposed to be here. I'm
			not supposed to be alive.
			She felt it was necessary to
			disclose this to you?
			I felt it was necessary.
			I see.
			You realize that it is very
			possible that the Enterprise-C
			could fail. We may be forced to
			remain in this time line... in
			which case your life would go on,
			hopefully for a long while.
			I know how important it is that
			they don't fail, Captain. That's
			why I'm requesting this transfer.
			Lieutenant, you don't belong on
			that ship...
			No. Captain Garrett belongs on
			that ship. But now that
			she's dead, there's a certain
			logic in this request.
			There's no logic in it at all.
			Tasha, whether they succeed or
			not, the Enterprise-C will be
			destroyed...
			At least, with a tactical officer
			on board, they will have a chance
			to defend themselves well,
			Captain... it may be a matter of
			seconds or minutes... but those
			could be the minutes that change
			history...
			Guinan says I died a senseless
			death in the other time line.
			I didn't like the sound of that,
			sir. I've always known the risks
			that come with a Starfleet
			uniform. If I am to die in one,
			I'd like my death to count for
			something.
			Lieutenant...
			Permission granted.
			Thank you, sir.
			I'm showing phaser banks up to
			seventy percent efficiency...
			we've got an hour left... see if
			you can get them up to ninety...
			Aye, sir...
			Parker, you've got Ops.
			Fredericks, you take the Conn...
			I'll handle Tactical.
			Lieutenant Tasha Yar reporting
			for duty, sir.
			You're not part of my crew.
			I am now. Captain Picard approved
			my request for transfer.
			This isn't a joke, Tasha. We're
			going back in the rift -- into
			battle -- and we're not coming
			back.
			I know the mission. These are
			my orders, Lieutenant.
			But I don't want you here.
			You need me. Show me someone on
			your crew that can do the job
			better than I can.
			Welcome aboard.
			Take your station, Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			We've finished the transfer of
			equipment, Captain. The new
			converters should be able to
			compensate for the damaged units
			on the Enterprise-C.
			Long-range scans have picked up
			Klingon battlecruisers, Captain.
			They are on an intercept course.
			E.t.a.?
			Fourteen minutes, thirty-one
			seconds.
			Red Alert. All hands to battle
			stations.
			I'm on my way, sir.
			Good-bye, Captain.
			Good-bye, Lieutenant.
			Damage control teams have all
			returned to the Enterprise-D...
			Captain.
			Raise shields.
			Shields up. Charging weapon
			systems.
			Good luck, Enterprise.
			Number and type of ships, Mister
			Crusher?
			Three K'vort class battlecruisers.
			Not bothering to cloak themselves.
			They shouldn't be so confident...
			after the pasting we gave them
			at Archer Four.
			We won't last long against that
			many.
			We could, of course, outrun the
			Klingons, but we must protect the
			Enterprise-C until she can enter
			the temporal rift.
			We may not survive... but we must
			succeed... Let's make sure they
			don't forget the name Enterprise.
			Shields holding.
			Hold your fire. Mister Crusher,
			come about to one-four-eight mark
			zero-zero-three, on my command.
			Aye sir.
			Ready photon torpedoes. Dispersal
			pattern: Sierra.
			Ready... and... now!
			One enemy target hit, sir.
			Moderate damage to their
			forward shields.
			Our shields still holding.
			Minor damage to secondary hull.
			Course one-seven-zero, mark
			zero-one-four.
			One ship has broken off and is
			heading toward the Enterprise-C.
			Mister Crusher. Belay previous
			course change... keep us within
			two hundred kilometers of the
			Enterprise-C.
			Aye, sir. Coming to two-one-seven
			mark one-one-five... increasing
			to two-thirds impulse.
			Damage control teams to deck
			fourteen.
			Engineering to bridge. Starboard
			power coupling is down.
			Containment field generator three
			is damaged -- attempting to
			bypass.
			If we lose anti-matter
			containment...
			Acknowledged, Engineer.
			The Klingons are flanking us...
			trying to draw us away from the
			Enterprise-C.
			Hold your course.
			Continual fire, all phasers.
			One enemy target destroyed.
			Damage report!
			Heavy casualties in the secondary
			hull. Navigational sensor array
			inoperative.
			Anti-matter containment fields
			failing... if I can't stabilize
			them, we'll have to eject the
			reactor core or she'll blow...
			Shields buckling, Captain. They
			will not --
			Engineer to bridge. Can't hold
			the antimatter containment
			fields... Initiating emergency
			shutdown...
			Coolant leak! bridge, we have
			a coolant leak in the engine core!
			I can't shut it down -- estimate
			two minutes to warp core
			breach...
			How long until the Enterprise-C
			enters the rift?
			Fifty-two seconds.
			All remaining power to defense
			systems.
			Power couplings severed in
			forward phaser banks. Attempting
			to by-pass.
			Controls not responding.
			Federation ship Enterprise...
			surrender and prepare to be
			boarded!
			Like hell.
			Report, Lieutenant.
			Readings fluctuated momentarily,
			Captain. It appeared to be a
			ship, but then it vanished.
			The rift is closing in on itself,
			Captain.
			Very well. Prepare a class-one
			sensor probe. We'll leave it
			behind to monitor the final
			closure. Mister Crusher, lay in
			a course for Archer Four.
			Guinan to Captain Picard... is
			everything all right up there?
			Guinan?... Yes... everything's
			fine. Is something wrong?
			No, sir. Sorry to bother you.
			Thanks, Guinan.
			Geordi... tell me about Tasha
			Yar.
