			Captain's log, Stardate 43714.1.
			We have finally succeeded in
			eradicating the plague on Cor
			Caroli Five, and are now
			preparing to leave orbit and
			proceed to our next mission --
			-- a rendezvous with the USS
			Hood to assist their terraforming
			efforts on Browder Four.
			Commander, ship's sensors detect
			an abnormal energy reading in the
			captain's quarters.
			Type?
			Undetermined.
			Riker to Captain Picard.
			Security team to captain's
			quarters --
			Picard to Enterprise.
			Anyone receiving this
			transmission, please respond.
			Security override. Priority one.
			Is something the matter,
			Lieutenant?
			It's all right. I'm not going
			to hurt you.
			Who -- ?
			Captain...
			Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise.
			Captain Picard! We've studied
			your missions at the Academy...
			Mitena Haro, first year cadet,
			Starfleet Academy.
			Perhaps you can explain what this
			is all about.
			Unfortunately, I can't, Mister...
			Tholl. Kova Tholl, of Mizar Two.
			Well, Mister Tholl, all I know
			is that I've been brought here
			against my will.
			Wherever "here" is...
			The same thing happened to me,
			sir. I was alone, studying...
			and I fainted. When I came to...
			That was about three days ago.
			And you, sir?
			I've been here twelve days,
			possibly more. I had been
			meditating privately -- and for no
			reason whatever, I lost
			consciousness.
			What can you tell me about our
			captors?
			Nothing. They've never shown
			themselves.
			Four sleeping areas... that
			implies we'll be joined by another
			captive...
			Food?
			It's edible... but I wouldn't call
			it food.
			I wouldn't touch that.
			Why not?
			If it's the door lock, the
			combination is too complex to hit
			at random -- I tried it, and was
			punished.
			Punished -- how?
			Severe pain... some sort of energy
			beam.
			I won't get near that panel
			again...
			The Enterprise will find us, won't
			it, sir? As soon as they discover
			you're missing, they'll start to
			search... Won't they?
			Of course they will. They'll do
			everything they can. In the
			meantime, we keep our heads...
			... and enjoy the hospitality.
			Yes, sir.
			Sir, the Hood has arrived at the
			rendezvous point. They are
			expecting us in thirty-six hours.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Mister Data. The nearest pulsar
			is in the Lonka cluster, is it
			not?
			Correct, sir.
			And what do we know about that
			pulsar?
			A great deal, sir. It is a
			rotating neutron star of
			approximately four point three
			five six solar masses.
			Mister Crusher -- how long would
			it take us to get there?
			At warp seven... thirty-four
			minutes.
			Mister Crusher -- make it so.
			Sir?
			Set course for the Lonka pulsar.
			Warp two.
			Aye, sir.
			Sir, at warp two -- we'll arrive
			at the pulsar in thirty-one
			hours...
			Thank you, Ensign. Engage.
			Captain, are we delaying our
			rendezvous with the Hood?
			We may have to.
			Mister Worf, contact the Hood and
			inform them of our delay.
			Aye, Commander.
			Belay that.
			There'll be no further
			communications off this ship
			without my prior authorization.
			Commander -- I'd like a word with
			you.
			Mister Data -- you have the
			bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			Data -- any guesses as to what
			this is all about?
			I see no point in randomly
			selecting alternative motivations
			for the captain's actions
			considering that not enough
			information has been offered to
			make any one "guess" superior to
			another.
			In other words, you don't know
			either.
			Number One... You know I like to
			keep you well informed as to the
			nature of our missions.
			Yes, sir.
			And if I don't inform you --
			there's a reason.
			I don't like keeping you in the
			dark, Commander... but for the
			next few days I won't be able to
			be as communicative as usual.
			It may make things difficult for
			you...
			Don't worry about me, sir. I can
			handle it.
			And the crew?
			You can count on us all, sir.
			I appreciate that, Number One.
			Picard -- what are you doing?
			Attempting to show our captors
			that we possess intelligence.
			You don't think they know that
			already? They can hear us
			talking...
			They may not realize we are
			communicating through language.
			Captain Picard's letting them know
			that we comprehend mathematics...
			by tapping out the first six prime
			numbers.
			I know what he's doing. I'm
			trying to understand why.
			To get their attention.
			Oh, you may get their attention,
			all right... and they'll give you
			a dose of agony for using the
			keypad.
			I'll take the chance. It's
			imperative that we communicate
			with our abductors... find out
			what they want.
			Obviously, they want us.
			Obviously. But why? What made
			our captors choose us? What makes
			us special?
			I couldn't say, Captain. I'm
			certainly not special -- I'm just
			one cadet.
			You're a Bolian. There are very
			few Bolians in Starfleet.
			I am one of three in the Academy.
			The other two have academic
			records much better than mine...
			What's your best area of study?
			Impulse propulsion systems. I'm
			really good with field coils...
			Good enough to be useful to our
			abductors?
			I don't know. Maybe.
			But if they needed an engineer,
			sir, why didn't they take a "real"
			one? Why pick a Starfleet cadet?
			That, I can't answer.
			The Bolians are maintaining an
			uneasy truce with the Moropa,
			are they not?
			That's right.
			But this doesn't look like Moropa
			technology... and, even assuming
			the Moropa wanted me, why would
			they want either of you?
			I've never even heard of the
			Moropa. My race has no enemies.
			None? In the last three hundred
			years of Mizarian history, your
			planet has been conquered six
			times!
			And we've survived by not
			resisting. Mizarians value peace
			above confrontation.
			Then you have no idea who might
			have done this.
			No. I don't know of anyone who
			bears malice toward my race.
			Or against you personally?
			You can't mean to suggest that
			someone with a personal grudge
			against me has gone to all this
			trouble...
			I'm not suggesting anything. I'm
			merely trying to come up with an
			explanation for your abduction.
			I'm sorry, Picard -- I can't give
			you one. I am neither important
			enough to hold for ransom nor
			radical enough to be dangerous.
			I'm a simple public servant...
			assistant to the regent of
			Pozaron, our third-largest city.
			Nonetheless, Mister Tholl --
			It would seem a new arrival is
			imminent...
			Stop! We mean you no harm...
			We are prisoners, like yourself!
			We are not the enemy!
			Who has done this?
			We don't know. We were brought
			here the same way you were. Our
			captors refuse to show
			themselves.
			I don't trust you...
			You must trust us. We wish only
			to return to our worlds. Were
			you abducted from Chalna?
			You know my planet?
			Yes. I visited there twelve
			years ago.
			Your five... and twenty more.
			Ouch.
			If it's too rich, fold.
			I'm thinking, I'm thinking...
			Think less, play more.
			I say he folds.
			I believe you are incorrect,
			Commander.
			In situations where more than two
			players have asked for three cards
			and the minimum raise was ten,
			Geordi has stayed in the game
			seventy-three percent of the
			time.
			I still say he folds.
			I don't want to hurt my average.
			Enter.
			Counselor, gentlemen. Forgive
			the intrusion... I was just
			passing by.
			You are always welcome, Captain.
			Don't let me interrupt... please
			continue.
			Bet is twenty-five to you,
			Lieutenant.
			You are bluffing.
			So was I.
			I was wondering, Mister La
			Forge... what's our engine
			efficiency status?
			Operating at ninety-three percent,
			sir.
			That's good, but I'd like to
			increase that efficiency to
			ninety-five percent.
			I'll get on it right away, sir.
			It wasn't an order, Mister La
			Forge. You can get to it later.
			I don't wish to disrupt your
			recreation.
			No problem, sir.
			Lady Luck left me long ago.
			Would you care to join us, sir?
			We have an opening.
			I'd rather just observe, if you
			don't mind.
			Of course not.
			Your bet, Counselor.
			Pair of threes.
			Flush. Queen high.
			That beats my three fours.
			Well played, Counselor.
			May I have a word with you?
			Certainly, sir.
			Forgive me, gentlemen. I'll
			return your player in a moment.
			Take your time, sir... she's won
			almost every hand.
			I wanted to ask you about the
			crew... how are they reacting to
			our sudden change in course?
			I've sensed no unusual reaction,
			Captain.
			After all -- such a change is
			hardly out of the ordinary.
			Aren't they curious or concerned
			as to why?
			Curious, yes -- concerned, no.
			They trust you.
			And how far do you think that
			trust goes?
			Sir?
			I know... the crew has always had
			full confidence in me.
			But if that were to change...
			I'd inform you, sir... of course.
			Thank you, Counselor.
			My given name is Esoqq.
			Has it a meaning?
			Yes... it means "fighter."
			I'll bet half the names in the
			Chalnoth language mean "fighter."
			Mizarians. Your names all mean
			"surrender."
			We are a peaceful race, a race
			of thinkers --
			A race of cowards.
			And you? I don't know your
			people.
			I am Mitena Haro, of Bolarus Nine.
			I'm a Bolian.
			Yes, that would follow.
			Who would want to imprison a
			child?
			I'm not a "child" --
			Esoqq -- I've been trying to
			determine if we have a common
			enemy... someone who'd have reason
			to confine us here.
			There are Chalnoth who would kill
			me if they could... but kidnap?
			There is no reason.
			You have many enemies?
			None of consequence. I've slain
			all the ones who mattered.
			That shocks you, Bolian?
			A little...
			I'm not surprised... I've heard
			about your race. You're
			uncivilized -- you have no laws,
			no system of government --
			The Chalnoth have no use for laws
			or governments! We are strong
			-- we obey no one.
			You live in anarchy, murdering
			one another -- that mentality
			may get us all killed.
			And you may be the first...
			Both of you -- this is getting
			us nowhere.
			Neither is asking us useless
			questions, Picard.
			But if you must pursue the topic,
			answer this: who are your enemies?
			The Federation's in conflict with
			half the galaxy.
			That's not true --
			Isn't it? How long have you and
			the Romulans been adversaries?
			Quite a while, Mister Tholl. And
			I'm perfectly willing to entertain
			the hypothesis that our captors
			are Romulans.
			But what would Romulans want with
			you?
			My brainpower, perhaps. It's well
			known that my species possesses
			superior intelligence... and I
			am considered among the smartest
			of my people.
			And the least modest.
			What is this?
			Food.
			The only food?
			It would seem so.
			Poison!
			Then there's nothing here for
			you to eat?
			You.
			Don't even think that! Picard
			-- you won't let him...
			Esoqq -- how long can you go
			without food?
			Three days. Perhaps four.
			No longer?
			No longer.
			All tests indicate the same result
			-- you're in great shape.
			I've never felt better.
			I see.
			Then why did you come in? Your
			annual physical wasn't due for
			another month.
			You usually have to remind me,
			then badger me, and finally order
			me to report. For once, I thought
			I'd save you the trouble.
			Jean-Luc -- be honest with your
			doctor. Were there any symptoms
			or warning signs you haven't told
			me about?
			As far as I know, I'm in perfect
			health.
			Well, then... return to your post.
			Will you dine with me tonight?
			In Ten-Forward?
			How about my quarters? More
			intimate.
			You're full of surprises today,
			Jean-Luc.
			I take that to be a yes.
			Picard -- is it wise to attempt
			an escape?
			It's imperative.
			Why? So far, our captors haven't
			mistreated us.
			We've been kidnapped, locked in
			a room -- you don't think that's
			mistreatment?
			They haven't hurt us, have they?
			I think we should just be patient
			until we find out what they want.
			We can no longer afford to be
			patient. If we don't act soon,
			Esoqq will starve...
			If we antagonize them, they may
			decide we're more trouble than
			we're worth... kill us, and go
			capture another four.
			I agree we're taking a risk.
			But I see no alternative.
			Well, I refuse to help.
			As you wish, Mister Tholl.
			We must open this panel.
			Not very sturdy...
			Haro -- stand back.
			The design is simple... crosscircuiting
			the door mechanism should be easy.
			Make it so.
			Yes, sir.
			I think I've got it...
			I warned you...
			Out with it, Jean-Luc.
			Out with what?
			Whatever's been on your mind all
			evening long.
			Has it been that apparent?
			You know me well, don't you?
			After all this time, I ought to.
			I have been preoccupied. I've
			been thinking about us... and the
			choices I've made.
			We've both made choices...
			And I've been wondering if they've
			been the right ones.
			Sometimes I feel we've allowed
			our positions to isolate us...
			Our positions necessitate a degree
			of professional detachment...
			But there's a danger in becoming
			too detached... in never allowing
			ourselves to get closer.
			Is that what you want, Jean-Luc?
			To get closer?
			You're a very attractive woman.
			And you're a very attractive man.
			But we both know it's not as
			simple as that.
			Would it be simpler if I weren't
			your commanding officer?
			Simpler, perhaps, but... that's not
			the only issue.
			Right now, I guess, I'm comfortable
			with our relationship the way it is.
			Then I'll respect that.
			Would you care to dance?
			All right.
			I don't know if I've ever told
			you... but I'm glad you're back
			on the Enterprise. I missed
			our... friendship.
			So did I...
			Jean-Luc, if I didn't know you
			better... I'd think you were
			playing games with me.
			Are you sorry you came here
			tonight?
			I didn't say that.
			Good. Because I'm delighted you
			did. But perhaps we should call
			it a night.
			Good night.
			I warned you not to provoke our
			captors. The next beams might
			be lethal.
			Not to you. You moved far from
			the door...
			Of course I did! Being stunned
			once was enough.
			You claim you were hit by the stun
			beam... before the rest of us
			arrived. You could be lying.
			Maybe our enemy is watching us...
			from inside.
			You accuse me of collaborating
			with our abductors?
			Collaboration is what your
			species does best!
			You did try to talk us out of
			attempting to escape...
			For all we know, you may be our
			captor.
			Impossible. I'm a Mizarian. My
			people are not agressive --
			How can we be sure you're a
			Mizarian? What if you're an
			impostor?
			This is nonsense! What if you're
			an impostor?
			Esoqq was the last one to
			appear... and he is the only one
			with a weapon...
			Which I may still use...
			Tholl -- our captors have
			transporters and stun beams. I
			hardly think they'd try to keep
			us at bay with a knife.
			Then maybe she's an impostor.
			She could have triggered the stun
			beams deliberately.
			I was hit, too...
			To forestall suspicion! You were
			very quick to volunteer...
			Tholl -- I asked her to open
			the door.
			You mean ordered her. You've
			been giving orders from the moment
			you got here... trying to make
			everyone do what you want.
			What I want is for all of us to
			escape.
			Why should we believe you?
			Captain Picard's put his life at
			stake for others many times...
			the primitive culture on Mintaka
			Three, the Wogneer creatures in
			the Ordek Nebula...
			Cor Caroli Five...
			Right -- helping to cure the Phyrox
			Plague.
			And how do we know this is the
			heroic Captain Picard? We have
			no proof of his identity...
			You've wasted our time with failed
			attempts to communicate with
			them or escape. Is that your
			task -- to keep us busy so we're
			off-guard?
			What have you to say, Picard?
			First officer's log, supplemental.
			Although we're still two hundred
			million kilometers from the Lonka
			pulsar, the Captain has ordered
			us to slow to one-half impulse.
			He has offered no explanation.
			I don't understand why we're
			going to this pulsar. And
			creeping up on it at half impulse
			makes even less sense...
			The captain's given unusual orders
			before...
			I know... but this time it's
			different. He's different. I
			can't put my finger on it... but
			I'm worried.
			The captain does seem... detached
			from his emotions.
			Mister La Forge -- we are
			operating at ninety-six percent
			engine efficiency. Well done.
			Thank you, sir.
			When we arrive at the pulsar, I'm
			going to need everyone at their
			best. I know I can count on you
			all.
			Of course, Captain.
			Excellent.
			An ale for me, please...
			... and for my officers...
			In fact, ales for everyone.
			Here's to the finest crew in
			Starfleet.
			You know, back when I was in the
			Academy, we would follow each
			toast with a song.
			An unusual tradition.
			Let's see if I can remember
			one...
			(Insert old English or Irish
			drinking song -- i.e., "Garry
			Owen")
			Commander... What's the captain
			up to?
			That's not the captain I know...
			... We have a mission that has no
			apparent purpose... by itself,
			I can accept that, all of us
			can... because the captain says
			it is important and we trust
			him... Then he runs the crew
			through efficiency drills for the
			first time in my tour of duty...
			but if he says we need them, we
			need them... because we trust the
			captain. But we also have a
			captain singing drinking songs with
			his men...
			... a captain who's come to the
			poker game for the first time...
			And he was very odd with me
			afterwards... he asked me to warn
			him if the crew started to lose
			confidence in him...
			Any signs of mental stress or
			trauma?
			He came in for a physical without
			a word from me...
			Anything unusual, doctor?
			He was in perfect health... every
			test result identical to his last
			physical... that's kind of unusual
			in itself, actually...
			It's almost as though he wanted
			to establish that there was
			nothing wrong with him.
			There was one... other...
			thing...
			He asked me to his cabin for
			dinner... I think he tried to
			seduce me.
			Which brings us to a most serious
			possibility -- is there an outside
			influence at work here...
			I can detect no evidence of
			telepathic coercion.
			Commander, there is one other fact
			we have not considered. The
			abnormal energy reading in the
			captain's quarters that was never
			explained.
			It is not enough evidence to
			justify mutiny.
			Worf -- nobody has suggested
			removing the captain from command.
			Nobody has yet.
			And nobody will -- unless we have
			solid evidence that the captain
			is unfit for duty.
			Right now, all we have are
			suspicions... not enough to act
			upon. The next move is his.
			Well, Picard? Prove to us you're
			not the enemy.
			I can't.
			You're right, Tholl. Any of
			us could be the enemy. And
			there's no way to prove we aren't.
			But unless we set aside our mutual
			fears and trust one another, we
			have no hope of escape.
			Sir... how can we trust each
			other?
			She's right. There may be an
			enemy among us.
			And what if there is, Mister
			Tholl? Shall we continue accusing
			one another until hostility leads
			to violence? Shall we allow our
			suspicions to destroy us?
			Let's see if we can deactivate
			that stun mechanism...
			Orbiting the pulsar at fifty
			million kilometers, sir.
			The pulsar is exactly as our
			records indicate. There appear to
			be no anomalies or significant
			changes since the last scan by a
			Federation ship.
			Helm -- take us in to twenty
			million kilometers.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf, divert enough power
			to the shields to offset the
			increased radiation and magnetic
			fields.
			Sir, at twenty million kilometers
			our shields will be effective for
			only eighteen minutes --
			Noted, Mister Data.
			Captain, may I have a word with
			you?
			You have the bridge, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			What is our mission?
			I'm under no obligation to tell
			you that.
			If you don't -- you force me to
			take command of this vessel.
			On what grounds?
			You're endangering this ship...
			for no reason.
			No reason you're aware of.
			That's not good enough. Your
			behavior has been erratic --
			Erratic enough to justify mutiny?
			Do you honestly believe you have
			sufficient evidence to convince
			a board of inquiry?
			No, I don't. But I can't let you
			risk the lives of the crew.
			Number One... has it occurred to
			you that you might be the one with
			the problem? I realize you've
			been under stress, and I'm willing
			to let the matter drop if you
			report to Sickbay for a full
			examination. Otherwise... I'll
			have to relieve you from duty.
			Think about it.
			That would appear to be the power
			lead to the stun device.
			It may be "live." Cutting it
			could be dangerous.
			I don't think it will be. Esoqq
			-- your knife, please.
			You assured me you'd cooperate.
			I may have overloaded it, sir.
			Mister Tholl...
			Picard, I still think this is a
			mistake --
			Now what? We're no better off
			than when we started!
			Captain -- number four shield
			has failed. Increasing power to
			number three shield to compensate.
			Helm -- move us closer. Ten
			million kilometers.
			Sir -- at that distance, the ship
			will not withstand the magnetic
			fields and radiation.
			Take us in, Mister Crusher.
			Belay that order.
			You're relieved of duty,
			Commander.
			Confine Mister Riker to his
			quarters.
			Mister Worf, I gave you an order.
			Maintain your position,
			Lieutenant.
			You're destroying yourself and
			anyone who is foolish enough to
			listen to you. Starfleet will
			never sanction this.
			I'll take that chance.
			You're making a terrible mistake,
			Will. Listen to me... as your
			captain... as your friend...
			You've shown none of the concerns
			that Captain Picard would show...
			the safety of this ship, the
			welfare of its crew...
			Mister Worf -- remove Commander
			Riker from the bridge.
			Mister Crusher -- take us away
			from the pulsar, heading
			one-eight-five mark three-two,
			full impulse.
			Full impulse -- aye, Commander.
			Engage.
			I hope you're satisfied, Picard.
			You've accomplished nothing.
			The sound of your voice is
			beginning to anger me.
			I think this charade has gone far
			enough, don't you?
			I don't understand...
			Yes, you do. This isn't a holding
			cell; it's a laboratory maze --
			and we're the white rats. A
			carefully concocted test... an
			experiment to see how we'd react
			under pressure.
			How do you know?
			It's the only explanation. Look
			at the four of us... we do have
			something in common: we all react
			differently to authority.
			You, the anarchist, reject
			authority in any form...
			... you, the collaborator, defer
			to whoever's in control...
			... I, a Starfleet Captain, am
			trained to command...
			... and you, a cadet, have sworn
			to obey a superior officer's
			authority.
			Our captors put us here and
			devised obstacles for us to
			overcome. We were given food
			Esoqq couldn't eat -- to make him
			a threat. We were given a door
			that wouldn't open -- until all
			four of us cooperated. And each
			time we succeeded, we were dealt
			a reversal -- to set us against
			each other again.
			While you observed our reactions.
			Sir, I've been trying to help --
			I found it unlikely that a
			first-year cadet would know of
			the Enterprise's visit to Mintaka
			Three... so I tested you.
			Starfleet has classified the Cor
			Caroli Five plague "secret." No
			cadet would have knowledge of the
			incident.
			Captain --
			You may as well drop the pretense.
			I refuse to play along any further
			-- I'm quitting the game. As far
			as I'm concerned, this experiment
			is over.
			You are correct, Captain Picard.
			To further our knowledge of alien
			interaction, we borrowed you,
			Tholl, and Esoqq, and replaced
			you with replicas.
			Replicas?
			Our transporter is able to
			replicate living matter --
			including the brain's many
			trillion dendritic connections
			where memory is stored.
			You mean there's a copy of me on
			Mizar Two?
			And an impostor running my ship.
			No longer. Commander Riker has
			taken charge of the Enterprise.
			Our species is telepathically
			linked; we are all in continual
			contact.
			Much more efficient than your
			primitive vocal communications.
			We would like to pursue this
			study... but, of course, your
			awareness of it would taint the
			results.
			We will therefore return you to
			your places of origin.
			Captain!
			Hold your positions. Take no
			action.
			Why did you choose to study the
			concepts of authority and
			leadership?
			Because our species has no such
			concepts.
			As we are all identical,
			distinctions among ourselves are
			meaningless. Hence we have no
			leaders -- no followers.
			We wanted to examine the nature
			of command. Under what conditions
			will authority be obeyed -- or
			disobeyed?
			Our replicas of Tholl and Esoqq
			explored this issue on Mizar Two
			and on Chalna... just as our
			Picard replica did on the
			Enterprise.
			Your responses were most
			intriguing.
			You had no right to put us through
			this just to satisfy your
			curiosity.
			Why not?
			Because kidnapping is immoral.
			The lives of other races must be
			respected.
			This concept of morality is a very
			interesting human characteristic.
			We shall have to study it
			sometime. Until then, Picard --
			Number One?
			Now, Mister Worf.
			What is this?
			Why do you hold us?
			Because there's something more
			you can learn from us. With an
			alert crew, even our "primitive
			vocal communications" are
			unnecessary. Commander Riker
			understood I wished to hold you
			here...
			... he had Mister Data scan you
			and pass the information to our
			security officer...
			... who devised a forcefield that
			would entrap you.
			But why?
			I've decided to perform an
			experiment of my own. I want to
			see how you react to being
			imprisoned.
			Captain -- our species cannot bear
			captivity.
			We were merely curious. We meant
			no harm.
			We did not, after all, injure you
			in any way.
			Captivity is an injury, regardless
			of how it's justified.
			And now that you've had a taste
			of captivity, perhaps you'll
			reconsider the morality of
			inflicting it upon others.
			In any event, we now know about
			your race -- and we know how to
			imprison you. Bear that in mind.
			Now get off my ship.
			Mister Crusher. Set course for
			our rendezvous with the Hood...
			Warp eight.
			Aye aye, sir.
			It's good to have you back.
			Status, Number One?
			Ship and crew functioning
			normally, Captain.
			Then my doppelganger caused no
			serious damage.
			Was the replica convincing?
			Very convincing, sir -- but not
			perfect.
			Not perfect in what way?
			Well, sir...
			... for one, I simply cannot
			believe you're that good a singer.
			A singer?
			I look forward to reading your
			report, Commander. At least, I
			think I do.
			Captain.
			Doctor...
			Course laid in, Captain.
			Engage.
