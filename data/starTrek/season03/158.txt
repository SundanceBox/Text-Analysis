			Brother John Bates, is not that
			the morning which breaks yonder?
			I think it be. But we have no
			great cause to desire the approach
			of the day.
			Who goes there?
			A friend.
			Under what captain serve you?
			Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
			I pray you, what thinks he of
			our estate?
			Even as men wrecked upon a sand,
			that look to be washed off the
			next tide.
			He hath not told his thought to
			the king?
			No, nor it is not meet he should.
			For though I speak it to you, I
			think the king is but a man, as
			I am. The violet smells to him
			as it doth to me, in his
			nakedness he appears but a man.
			Therefore, his fears, out of
			doubt, be of the same relish as
			ours are. Yet, no man should
			possess him with any appearance
			of fear, lest he, by showing it,
			should dishearten his army.
			He may show what outward courage
			he will, but I believe, as cold
			a night as 'tis, he could wish
			himself in Thames up to the neck.
			Methinks I could not die anywhere
			so contented as in the king's
			company, his cause being just and
			his quarrel honorable.
			That's more than we know.
			Aye, or more than we should seek
			after. If his cause be wrong,
			our obedience to the king wipes
			the crime of it out of us.
			But if the cause be not good, the
			king himself hath a heavy
			reckoning to make when all those
			legs and arms and heads chopped
			off in a battle shall join
			together at the latter day and
			cry all "We died at such a place"
			-- some swearing, some crying for
			a surgeon, some upon their wives
			left poor behind them. I am
			afeared there are few die well
			that die in a battle.
			The king is not bound to answer
			the particular endings of his
			soldiers, the father of his son,
			nor the master of his servant.
			Delightful... you're getting
			better and better, Data...
			Freeze program.
			Thank you, sir. I plan to study
			the performances of Olivier,
			Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark...
			Data, you are here to learn about
			the human condition... and there's
			no better way than embracing
			Shakespeare... but you must
			discover it through your own
			performance, not by imitating...
			Riker to Picard...
			Yes, Number One.
			Sensors are picking up an
			unidentified craft in the Neutral
			Zone... It's heading toward
			Federation space...
			On our way... Picard out. We'll
			get to the next act later, Data...
			computer, end program.
			It is interesting that a king
			could pass as a commoner, but why
			should he wish to? If he is
			the leader... should he not be
			leading... ?
			But listen to what Shakespeare
			is telling you about the man,
			Data... a king who has a true
			feeling for his soldiers must
			share their fears on the day of
			battle.
			Sir, will I be able to schedule
			a performance for the crew in
			the near future?
			Let's... not rush it, shall we... ?
			Outpost Sierra Six confirms our
			readings, sir. They identify it
			as a Romulan scout ship... bearing
			two-seven-zero mark one-four.
			A scout ship? Curious. What
			would bring a scout ship into the
			Neutral Zone?
			Shall we transmit a warning to
			withdraw, sir... ?
			Open hailing frequencies.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, the Romulan is hailing
			us.
			Visual... ?
			Not within range yet...
			Open channel...
			Federation ship... do you read...
			I require urgent assistance...
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard
			of the...
			Federation ship... please help
			me... requesting asylum... under
			pursuit...
			Pursuit... ?
			Visual contact. On screen,
			Captain...
			Red Alert. Open a channel to
			the warship.
			Come to intercept course. Keep
			us out of the Neutral Zone.
			Channel is open.
			When will the scout cross into
			Federation territory?
			Forty-one seconds...
			Romulan warbird, you have crossed
			into the Neutral Zone, and are
			engaged in hostile action.
			Explain yourself and your intent.
			No reply, sir.
			Hail the scout.
			Responding.
			On screen.
			Please, you must help me...
			We are moving to intercept...
			maintain your course and power...
			Scout ship is severely damaged,
			Captain. Engines inoperative,
			shields down.
			Position?
			Coordinates one-four-zero by
			two-zero-five.
			Federation space.
			Bring us to within five kilometers
			of the scout. Mister La Forge,
			prepare to extend our shields
			around that ship.
			Captain, at that range, the
			shields won't be able to take much
			punishment.
			Five kilometers, Commander.
			All stop.
			Extend shields.
			Shields in place... we've got the
			scout ship, Captain...
			Weapons on the warbird are fully
			powered, sir.
			Lock phasers...
			Open a channel.
			Ready.
			Romulan warbird, you are now in
			Federation territory... if you
			do not immediately withdraw...
			No argument?
			Warbird has re-entered the Neutral
			Zone, Captain. Heading for
			Romulan territory.
			Cowards.
			Massive power failure on the scout
			ship, sir. All systems are going
			off-line.
			Including life-support.
			Transporter Room Two, prepare to
			beam the occupant of the Romulan
			ship aboard.
			Mister Worf.
			Data, lock onto the scout ship
			and take it in tow... cancel Red
			Alert.
			Energize.
			I must see your captain
			immediately.
			We'll take you to Sickbay, after
			that...
			This cannot wait. I have
			information vital to your
			survival.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43462.5.
			We have beamed aboard an apparent
			Romulan defector. He claims to
			be a low ranking logistics officer
			with extraordinary information
			about a new secret offensive.
			The humiliating defeat at the
			Battle of Cheron has not been
			forgotten. The new leaders have
			vowed to discard the treaty and
			claim the Neutral Zone. Nelvana
			Three is only the first step.
			And you're saying a whole base
			is already established there... ?
			In forty-eight hours, the reactor
			core will be on line.
			The Federation sensors that
			monitor the Neutral Zone just...
			missed it... ?
			It would seem so.
			Unlikely.
			In two days, you will have a fleet
			of Romulan warbirds... within
			striking distance of fifteen
			Federation sectors...
			The Federation will not permit
			it...
			Then it is war we're talking
			about, isn't it?
			Destroy the base now and the
			threat is over.
			I'm sure you're tired from your
			ordeal... and could use some
			medical attention. Mister Worf,
			accompany Sublieutenant Setal to
			sickbay. We'll arrange for your
			quarters.
			No doubt you will wish to question
			me further.
			No doubt.
			He tells a hell of a story.
			You don't believe it...
			The empire knows we'd never allow
			them to maintain a base within
			the Neutral Zone.
			Commander, it would not be an
			atypical Romulan ploy. In their
			long history of war, the Romulans
			have rarely attacked first... they
			prefer to test their enemy's
			resolve.
			And how many times in their
			history has there been a Romulan
			defector?
			Never, sir.
			Because loyalty is fundamental
			to their culture.
			You really think he's a spy,
			Commander?
			I think he's been planted to draw
			us into the Neutral Zone... we'd
			look like the aggressors...
			... and the Romulans would have
			a legitimate excuse to respond
			with force.
			Exactly.
			That would also not be an atypical
			Romulan ploy, sir.
			It is always a chess game with
			them, isn't it?
			Well at least he's given us the
			chance to get a look at some
			Romulan technology.
			Mister La Forge, you will head
			the away team over to the scout.
			Commander, you and Counselor Troi
			will conduct Setal's
			interrogation.
			Permission to observe the
			interrogation, sir...
			No, I need you with me on the
			bridge, Data... there's much to
			be done.
			We have less than forty-eight
			hours to prevent a war... or
			perhaps start one. That depends
			on establishing the truth of...
			I set the auto-destruct sequencer
			before I left the ship.
			Why?
			Wouldn't you? To prevent your
			ship from being captured?
			Excuse me for being a little
			confused, Setal, but I thought
			you were defecting...
			I am not a traitor.
			All you can see is the opportunity
			to exploit me. The Federation
			credo, exploitation. You couldn't
			get aboard my ship fast enough
			-- strip it down, "what secrets
			might it reveal that we can
			use... ?" You are a short sighted
			people... can't you understand
			I came to stop a war.
			If you could just hold still for
			a moment...
			With your metabolism, it will take
			a couple of days to heal...
			Thank you, Doctor... I am
			fortunate that you know something
			of Romulan medicine.
			I've had a chance to gain some
			experience recently.
			Ah yes... the incident at
			Galorndon Core, our two
			officers...
			You are aware of a great deal for
			a logistics clerk.
			It was common knowledge.
			I can show you my rating code.
			Forged credentials are a simple
			matter for a spy.
			How can you allow Klingon Pahtk
			to walk around in a Starfleet
			uniform?
			You are lucky this is not a
			Klingon ship. We know how to deal
			with spies...
			Remove this tohzah from my
			sight...
			Your knowledge of Klingon curses
			is impressive.
			But, as the Romulans might say,
			only a Veruul would use such
			language in public.
			Mister Worf, please see to the
			security arrangements for our
			guest's stay...
			You find something amusing?
			Lieutenant Worf, I like him. Or,
			to be more accurate, I understand
			him. He's a warrior. Proud,
			fearless, living only for combat.
			Exactly the type who will get us
			all killed if we're not careful.
			This is the food station... you
			can reach me through the
			com panel.
			Later, there are a few more
			questions we'd like to ask you...
			Computer, water.
			Temperature?
			Twelve onkians.
			This system is calibrated to the
			Celsius metric system.
			Any temperature at all. On the
			cold side of your system, whatever
			that is.
			There is no unusual activity in
			the Nelvana System...
			Isolate and magnify the Nelvana
			star system.
			Nothing on the sensors, sir.
			It is hard to believe what we
			cannot see, Data. And yet, with
			their cloaking technology, a fleet
			of Romulan warships could
			conceivably be passing right
			before our eyes.
			There must be a way we can
			neutralize that advantage...
			Captain Picard, priority one
			message from Starfleet coming
			in on secured channel.
			In my Ready Room. Delay time,
			computer... ?
			Two hours, twenty-two minute delay
			from time of transmission at
			Starfleet Command on Lya Three.
			Computer, key access four-one-two
			mark eight-zero. Picard. Jean-
			Luc. Starfleet priority code
			Gamma. Decode.
			Begin message.
			Captain, we have received an
			official protest from the Romulan
			Empire demanding the return of
			your defector. We are obviously
			refusing to comply. I join in
			your skepticism, but if it is a
			deception, the Romulans are
			certainly going all out to make
			a good show of it. The
			Federation Council has convened
			in emergency session.
			There's no doubt in my mind this
			will eventually fall on your
			shoulders, Jean-Luc. You've got
			him. You must decide if he's
			telling the truth. For now, I
			suggest you proceed along the
			Neutral Zone border toward a
			Federation position proximate to
			Nelvana Three.
			Picard to Lieutenant Worf. Please
			come to my Ready Room.
			You've never actually stepped foot
			on Nelvana Three.
			That's right.
			You were a logistics officer
			assigned to sector eight-one-five...
			Eight-one-four.
			Eight-one-four, yes. So your
			conclusions about the secret base
			are solely based on a few files
			you happened to see in a
			computer.
			Massive files, Commander...
			transport schedules, troop
			movements... construction
			reports...
			And where are they?
			All these files? Why not bring
			the files to prove what you're
			saying?
			It was not a simple matter of
			just taking them... Romulan
			security is unmatched...
			Yet you managed to get all the
			way across the Neutral Zone in
			a one man ship... quite an
			achievement...
			I saw an opportunity... I took
			it... by the time they realized
			I had the scout ship... it was
			too late...
			Are all logistics officers taught
			to pilot scout ships?
			I depended a great deal on the
			computer to navigate. I have
			rudimentary knowledge, that's
			all...
			Do you expect anything out of this
			for yourself?
			The idea of a Romulan pursuing a
			noble cause is impossible, I
			suppose.
			It was only a question.
			Do you realize I have given up
			my life for this? I can never
			go back. Do you think I did this
			for wealth, a new home, what?
			We're trying to get to the truth
			here, Sublieutenant.
			You have the truth before you. You
			are too blind to see it.
			I have seen enough bloodshed for
			one lifetime.
			So have we all.
			Then do as I ask! I know how
			difficult it is for you to believe
			me. I feel the same suspicions
			toward you. But we must look
			beyond our long-standing animosity
			and work toward the good of both
			our people.
			Slow playback... display engine
			logs and power data of both
			vessels...
			Now... look what happens at
			zero-nine-five-four-three-three
			on the clock...
			The scout has sustained engine
			damage... forcing it to drop to
			point-six-one-five impulse
			power... for all intents and
			purposes he's finished, dead...
			the warship should overtake
			him... only it doesn't. Point
			two-six seconds later, the
			warbird slows to precisely
			the same speed...
			Three times... three speed
			fluctuations... the warship
			always kept its distance... I
			don't think they wanted to catch
			up.
			And yet they fired at the scout
			ship... they could have killed
			him...
			Not necessarily, Doctor... the
			Romulans have the same capability
			to direct the impact of their
			weapons as we do.
			Doctor, is there any possibility
			his wound was self-inflicted?
			It was a bad burn... I hardly
			think...
			A possibility...
			Captain's log, Stardate 43463.7.
			We are holding a position at the
			Neutral Zone border proximate to
			Nelvana Three.
			There are twenty one hours left
			before the Romulan base becomes
			functional, if our guest is
			telling the truth. Counselor
			Troi, however, feels Sublieutenant
			Setal is being deliberately
			deceptive.
			The Monitor and the Hood are
			headed in your direction though
			they will arrive too late to be
			of assistance. Warnings have gone
			out to all outposts along the
			border... as well as several
			independent vessels in nearby
			sectors.
			No one here wants a war, Captain.
			But we're prepared to take them
			on if that's what they want. All
			Federation starships have been
			placed on Yellow Alert.
			Come.
			You wanted to see me, Captain?
			Data, prepare a class one probe.
			Set sensors for maximum scan.
			I want every meter of Nelvana
			Three monitored.
			I will start my calibrations, sir.
			One moment.
			Sit down.
			Do you require something else from
			me, sir?
			Yes. Your clarity of thought,
			your objectivity... as always...
			We're very possibly about to go
			to war, Data. The repercussions
			of what we do during the next
			twenty-four hours may be felt
			for years to come. I'd like you
			to keep the official record of
			these events, so we may give
			history the benefit of a
			dispassionate view.
			I will begin immediately, sir.
			Is that all?
			How are the crew's spirits?
			They are concerned, Captain, of
			course. But confident. Can you
			not see that yourself?
			Unlike King Henry, it's not so
			easy for me to disguise myself
			and walk among my troops.
			That's all, Data.
			"Now if these men do not die well,
			it will be a black matter for the
			King that led them to it."
			Why must we waste time playing
			this ridiculous game?
			I sense there is more here you
			wish to tell us, yet you force
			yourself to hold back.
			I've told you all you need to know
			about Nelvana Three.
			I am not speaking of the base.
			The base is all that matters.
			You're lying, Setal.
			If you'll go to Nelvana Three,
			you will see...
			We're not going anywhere til we
			get to the truth...
			You're a spy, aren't you?
			No.
			Then prove it. You can start by
			telling me something about the
			location and strength of the
			Romulan fleet...
			I don't know it...
			You're a logistics officer...
			For only one sector...
			Who's your commanding officer?
			Admiral Alidar Jarok.
			The position of Romulan bases
			along the Neutral Zone...
			I don't know...
			In your sector then...
			Irrelevant.
			Strength of troops under your
			admiral's command...
			Irrelevant.
			Irrelevant.
			I agree with you... it's not worth
			playing this game.
			What a fool I've been. To have
			come looking for courage in a lair
			of cowards.
			Captain Picard, priority message
			from security officer, Klingon
			vessel Patakt...
			Lieutenant Worf, handle this at
			security station, deck nine...
			Aye, sir...
			Sensors are configured for
			planetary probe, sir... ready for
			launch.
			Proceed.
			Probe on course. Sensors are
			functioning...
			Coordinate your analysis with
			Mister La Forge... I want your
			report with dispatch...
			I don't know, Data... my gut tells
			me we oughta believe what this
			guy is trying to tell us...
			Your gut?
			It's just a... a feeling, you
			know? Instinct, emotions...
			It seems to me those qualities
			interfere with rational judgment.
			You're right. They do sometimes.
			Then why not rely strictly on
			fact?
			You can't always trust the plain
			and simple facts... they lie
			sometimes...
			They can lead to wrong
			conclusions, but they cannot lie.
			What do you think? Is he a
			defector or not?
			The facts to date would lead to
			an objective conclusion that he
			is not.
			Somehow I think we're gonna catch
			the Romulans with their pants down
			on Nelvana Three... Just like he
			says.
			"With their pants down." A
			metaphor, catching them in the
			act... because your "gut" tells
			you so...
			But of course you can't just go
			with your gut either. It's a
			combination, Data... let me put
			it this way... all these feelings
			that get in the way of human
			judgment... that confuse the hell
			out of us... that make us second
			guess ourselves. We need them.
			We need them to help fill in the
			missing pieces... because we
			almost never have all the facts.
			So a person fills in missing
			pieces of the puzzle with his own
			personality... resulting in a
			conclusion based as much on
			instinct and emotion as on fact.
			Now you're getting it.
			What does one do if he has no
			instinct and emotion?
			Data... look at this... the facts
			just took a left turn...
			As the probe went into orbit
			around Nelvana Three, it began
			to pick up low level subspace
			radio emissions...
			Could they be naturally occuring?
			The patterns are clearly
			artificial, Captain...
			The signal is so faint our ship
			sensors can't read it from this
			distance.
			Can we decode it?
			We've tried. It's probably
			Romulan... but we can't be sure.
			Cloaked Romulan ships could
			produce this effect.
			What about the planet surface?
			Reading nothing but barren rock.
			They might be able to hide a base
			from the probe... its capabilities
			are limited. The only way we'll
			know for sure is if we go and take
			a look for ourselves.
			That will be all, gentlemen.
			I take it you've never seen a
			Romulan before.
			That would be an incorrect
			assumption.
			Then why do you invade my privacy?
			I am attempting to ascertain what
			my guts tell me about you.
			You're the android.
			I know a host of Romulan
			cyberneticists who would love to
			be this close to you.
			I do not find the concept
			particularly appealing.
			Nor should you.
			I am told by various crewmembers
			that this viewport is their
			favorite on the ship.
			I thought it would bring me
			comfort. But these are not my
			stars. Even the heavens are
			denied to me here.
			Synthetic swill...
			I don't suppose your food
			terminals are capable of preparing
			a Romulan ale.
			I am afraid they would require the
			molecular structure of the beverage
			in question. And, as you are no
			doubt aware, our knowledge of your
			planet is quite limited.
			The loss is yours. For I have
			visited over a hundred different
			worlds and none possessed the
			awesome beauty of Romulus.
			Am I correct in assuming you
			regret your decision to come here?
			No, what I did had to be done.
			But to never again see the
			firefalls of Gath Gal'thong, or
			the spires of my home rising above
			the Apnex Sea. To be exiled from
			your home is a bitter thing.
			It does appear unlikely that you
			will ever be allowed to return
			to your world again.
			The cold reaction of an android.
			But perhaps we can bring Romulus
			to you.
			Program complete.
			Run program.
			After you.
			The valley of Chula. I know it
			well.
			You are free to stay here as long
			as you wish.
			Turn it off. I no longer live
			here.
			Cancel program.
			This is my home now. My future.
			I've sacrificed everything. It
			must not be in vain.
			Arrange a meeting between myself
			and Captain Picard.
			Tell him Admiral Jarok wants to
			see him.
			Captain, we have confirmed that
			you are holding Admiral Alidar
			Jarok...
			He's been identified as the
			commander at the massacre of the
			Norkan outposts. The council
			strongly advises you to consider
			Jarok an unreliable source of
			information.
			Show him in.
			Wait outside, Ensign. Have a
			seat... Admiral Jarok.
			Captain... there is no more
			time...
			Have a seat, Admiral.
			I am not convinced you are
			telling the truth.
			What must I do...
			You must convince me.
			If I had irrefutable evidence...
			... but you did not bring
			irrefutable evidence. You brought
			no evidence at all. In fact, this
			entire escape stretched your
			credibility beyond belief. Now
			we hear that you are not even who
			you claimed to be.
			A Romulan defector is virtually
			a contradiction in terms. But
			Admiral Jarok crossing the
			lines...
			I have explained my motives to
			your interrogators...
			Yes, peace in our galaxy.
			Except you are not a man of peace,
			Admiral. Your military record,
			what we know of it, is clear...
			... which is precisely why I chose
			an alternate identity here...
			... the massacre at the Norkan
			Outposts, for example...
			Your "massacre" was called the
			Norkan Campaign on my world,
			Captain. One world's hero is
			another world's madman. Perhaps
			I am neither one.
			On what basis shall I decide,
			Admiral? Your good word? Are
			you willing to reveal ways to
			overpower the Romulan B-type
			warbirds we may encounter? Are
			you prepared to help us detect
			them through their cloaking
			shields?
			You see my problem, Admiral. You
			ask us for faith in circumstances
			not only difficult to believe but
			compounded by your own lies, and
			your own reluctance to tell us
			all you know...
			I cannot betray my people...
			You have already betrayed your
			people. You have made your
			choices. You are a traitor, sir.
			If the bitter taste of it
			disagrees with you, I am truly
			sorry. But I will not risk the
			lives of my crew because you think
			you can dance on the edge of the
			Neutral Zone. You have crossed
			over, Admiral. I suggest you make
			yourself comfortable.
			Do you have children, Captain
			Picard? A family?
			No.
			Then you have sacrificed too much
			for your career.
			Yes, this is all very interesting,
			but...
			There's a moment in a man's life,
			Captain, that you cannot know...
			when he looks down at the first
			smile of his baby girl and he
			knows that he must change the
			world for her... for all children.
			It is for her that I am here.
			Not to betray the Romulan Empire,
			but to save it.
			For months, I tried to persuade
			the high command that another war
			would destroy the empire. They
			grew tired of my arguments, and
			finally censored me, sent me off
			to command a distant sector. This
			was my only recourse. I will
			never see my child smile again,
			Captain. She will grow up
			believing her father was a
			traitor. But she will grow up.
			If you act, Picard. If we stop
			the war before it begins...
			I cannot. And will not. Unless
			I have your unequivocal
			assistance.
			Admiral Jarok has provided me with
			the strength, location and
			tactical plans for the Romulan
			fleet.
			Mister La Forge, he is prepared
			to give you data regarding
			engines, weapons and cloaking
			systems on the warbird class
			starship. But I believe we'll
			find his experience as a field
			commander more valuable in a
			strategic sense than in the
			technical areas.
			Any edge'll help, Captain.
			Don't depend on it. For all we
			know, he may still be lying.
			We'll find out soon enough.
			Number One, set a course for
			Nelvana Three.
			Second officer's log,
			supplemental. We are prepared
			to enter the Neutral Zone in
			direct violation of the Treaty
			of Algeron.
			We must presume Romulan warships
			are cloaked and monitoring us.
			We expect swift and heavy
			resistance as we approach Nelvana
			Three.
			Course plotted and laid in.
			All decks showing condition red.
			Engineering ready, sir.
			Defensive systems standing by.
			Engage.
			Tactical?
			Nothing on sensors.
			I don't like it... I would have
			expected a greeting party...
			Number One, you echo another
			noteworthy commander in a similar
			circumstance. One of your
			countrymen...
			George Armstrong Custer when his
			Seventh Cavalry arrived at the
			Little Big Horn.
			May we have better luck.
			Approaching Nelvana system.
			Engage impulse engines.
			Nelvana Three on screen.
			Still no sign of them on
			sensors...
			In a way, I'd rather be fighting
			my way there... it's too damned
			easy.
			Prepare to enter standard orbit.
			Data?
			Scanning the planet. No life
			forms. No power sources. No
			weapons systems.
			No indication of a base at all?
			No sir.
			The subspace signal the probe
			detected? The ionization
			disturbances?
			I am picking them up, sir... but I
			cannot identify the source...
			They... seem to be moving in an
			orbital path with an eight hundred
			kilometer apogee.
			Have Jarok brought to the bridge.
			It's possible they abandoned the
			base after he defected.
			There is no scarring on the
			planet surface that would denote
			heavy construction of any kind.
			A cloaking device, perhaps...
			something to hide the whole
			base...
			A cloaking device operating on
			the surface would be given away
			by visible distortion effects.
			Perhaps you'd like to tell us why
			we're here, Admiral.
			There doesn't seem to be a base.
			I don't understand...
			Nelvana Three, Admiral... no base,
			no weapons, no sign of life at
			all.
			But I saw the tactical
			communiques... records...
			timetables for completion... an
			entire legion was assigned to the
			mission...
			Could they have been feeding you
			disinformation?
			You said you had been censored.
			Reassigned four months ago. They
			knew of your dissatisfaction...
			could this have been a test of
			your loyalty?
			No... no, that's impossible...
			They let you escape with an
			arsenal of worthless secrets...
			what other explanation is there?
			Captain, permission to withdraw
			from the Neutral Zone.
			Proceed.
			Helm a hundred eighty degrees about. 
			Get us out of here, Geordi...
			I hear you, Commander...
			Three Romulan warships
			uncloaking... coordinates...
			They're firing photon torpedoes...
			Shields holding...
			Damage...
			Minor damage in the secondary
			hull... power transfer fields may
			be pinched off... working on it...
			Captain... ?
			Not yet, Mister Worf.
			This is just a tap on the
			shoulder. Or we wouldn't be here
			talking about it.
			They're hailing us, Captain...
			On screen...
			Captain Picard, I hardly expected
			to see you again so soon. It
			seems this time you are the one
			who has made an aggressive move
			across the Neutral Zone...
			Commander Tomalak, as I suspect
			you already know, we have
			responded to a warning of a
			Romulan incursion on Nelvana
			Three...
			But, Captain, as you can see,
			there is no incursion...
			There is the matter of an
			unidentified subspace radio
			emission... and ionization
			distubrances...
			Ah, you must mean our orbiting
			probe... we are studying Nelvana
			Three for...
			archaeological research...
			With a cloaked satellite...
			Really, Captain, would you have
			us believe this satellite is an
			excuse for your aggressive charge
			across the Neutral Zone?
			Believe whatever you wish,
			Tomalak. We will be on our way.
			Without even an apology, Captain?
			If an apology will do, I will
			offer it.
			I'm afraid it won't. So I will
			save you the humiliation.
			Get to it, Tomalak.
			You see, Picard, after we dissect
			your Enterprise for every precious
			bit of information, I plan to
			display its broken hull in the
			center of the Romulan capitol as
			a symbol of our victory. It will
			inspire our armies for generations
			to come and serve as a warning to
			any other traitor who would create
			ripples of disloyalty.
			All the communiques, the records,
			the timetables... they were
			fiction, written for my benefit...
			it was all a... a test... a test
			of my loyalty... and you used me
			to lure the Enterprise into the
			Neutral Zone.
			First, Captain, you will return
			the traitor, Jarok... then you
			will surrender as prisoners of
			war...
			Do you seriously expect me to
			agree to those terms?
			No, Captain Picard, I expect you
			won't.
			You have thirty seconds to decide.
			I do not require one second.
			Captain Picard, I urge you.
			Surrender. Consider the men and
			women you would lead into a lost
			cause.
			If the cause is just and
			honorable, they are prepared to
			give their lives. Are you
			prepared to die today, Tomalak?
			I expected more from you than an
			idle threat, Picard.
			And so you shall have it. Now,
			Mister Worf.
			Aye, Captain...
			Klingon vessels are armed and
			ready, Captain.
			What shall it be, Tomalak?
			You will still not survive our
			assault...
			Nor will you survive ours,
			Commander. Shall we die
			together... ?
			I look forward to our next
			meeting, Captain.
			Romulan disruptors powering down,
			Captain.
			Mister Worf, extend the
			appreciation of the Federation...
			and my personal gratitude... to
			the Klingons.
			Aye, sir.
			Take us home, Number One.
			I did it... for nothing. My home,
			my family. For nothing.
			He ingested a Felodesine chip.
			He must have brought it with him.
			I'm sorry, Captain... there was
			no antidote.
			A letter to his wife and
			daughter.
			Sir, he must have known it would
			be impossible for us to deliver
			this.
			Today, perhaps... but if there
			are others as courageous as
			Admiral Jarok... there is hope
			for a day of peace when we can
			take his letter home.
