			Welcome to Risa. All that is ours
			is yours.
			We are looking for the lodging
			chamber of Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			A file scan reveals no record of
			a Captain Picard currently
			visiting Risa.
			When is he expected to arrive?
			Where is no arrival date on file
			for any such individual.
			Could we have been mistaken?
			He will come.
			First officer's log, Stardate
			43745.2. We are in orbit of
			Gemaris Five where, for the past
			two weeks, Captain Picard has been
			serving as mediator in a trade
			dispute between the Gemarians and
			their nearest neighbor, the
			Dachlyds.
			Welcome back, Counselor.
			It's good to be back. It's been
			a grueling two weeks.
			I take it the captain was able
			to negotiate an agreement mutually
			beneficial to both parties.
			He did. Though I don't know how
			he managed it. Both the Gemarians
			and the Dachlyds are incredibly
			stubborn people.
			The more difficult the task, the
			sweeter the victory.
			Break us out of orbit, Mister
			Bennett. Set a course for
			Starbase twelve.
			Report, Number One.
			Everything status quo, sir.
			Very well...
			If anyone needs me, I'll be in
			my Ready Room.
			Sir...
			Congratulations.
			About what?
			About the trade agreement.
			Counselor, is it my imagination
			or is something bothering the
			captain?
			He has been under a great deal
			of strain lately. While on
			Gemaris he ate sparingly... and
			slept even less.
			Is there anything we can do?
			I have a solution in mind, but
			I doubt he'll agree to it.
			And what would that be?
			Our captain needs a vacation.
			Come.
			Sir, it's come to my attention
			one of the crew has been
			neglecting his health again.
			How so?
			He suffers from a classic case
			of stress related ailments brought
			about by overwork. Exhaustion,
			irritability... muscle spasms.
			Yet he insists on ignoring them.
			It doesn't sound all that serious.
			And I plan to keep it that way.
			Recommended treatment.
			A week's shore leave.
			Impossible.
			Jean-Luc... I could make it an
			order.
			But you won't... Beverly you know
			I loathe vacations.
			You loathe going on vacation.
			Once you're there you have a
			marvelous time. You told me you
			loved the four days you spent on
			Zytchin Three.
			I lied.
			The Enterprise is scheduled to
			spend a week undergoing a
			maintenance overhaul at Starbase
			twelve. While there, I promise
			to make full use of all available
			recreation activities.
			Watching some technician fill
			deuterium tanks is not my idea
			of fun.
			I suppose I could find a few hours
			to spend on the Holodeck.
			Forget about the Holodeck. There
			must be someplace you'd like to
			go.
			The Astrophysics Center on Icor
			Nine is holding a symposium on rogue
			star clusters. I had given serious
			thought to attending.
			Serious thought is the last thing
			you need. Why not go some place
			beautiful? Where you can relax
			and be pampered. You deserve it.
			I'll give it serious thought.
			Captain...
			Beverly... enough.
			So have you decided where you're
			going yet?
			Yes Number One, I have.
			The bridge.
			I meant for your shore leave.
			Not you too.
			Halt.
			I know this perfect little
			vacation spot... In fact, its
			co-ordinates lie within this
			sector.
			How convenient. Except I have
			absolutely no intention of taking
			a holiday. Do I make myself
			clear?
			Very clear...
			Good. I'm glad we've got that
			straightened out.
			Resume.
			It's called Risa. And believe
			me Captain, it's paradise. Warm
			tropical breezes... exotic food...
			and nothing to do but sit back
			and enjoy the quiet.
			And then there's --
			... the women...
			... of course.
			I'm sure you'd find their
			sybaritic outlook on life very
			appealing.
			I'm sure I would.
			I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.
			Unfortunately, this vessel is
			about to undergo extensive
			repairs requiring my personal
			supervision.
			But what about Risa?
			Some other time, Number One.
			Will, I've just received some
			delightful news.
			Really?
			There's an excellent chance my
			mother may be meeting us at
			Starbase twelve.
			Your mother?
			Yes, she's returning home from
			a conference on Achrady Seven.
			She's going to try to rearrange
			her schedule so she can spend some
			time visiting with us.
			That's wonderful, Deanna.
			She mentioned how much she's
			looking forward to seeing you
			again, Captain.
			Did she?
			Commander, I'd like a word with
			you. In private.
			Is something wrong, Captain?
			Tell me, Number One, is the entire
			crew aware of this little scheme
			to send me off on holiday?
			I believe there are two ensigns
			stationed on deck thirty-nine who
			know nothing about it.
			I suppose this means I can look
			forward to a week of continual
			harassment on the subject.
			I admit I have been feeling a bit
			fatigued.
			I'll see to it that these bags are
			beamed directly to your room.
			You look very handsome, Captain...
			If you don't mind my saying so.
			You're not really bringing all
			these books with you?
			I thought I'd take along some
			light reading... in case I got
			bored.
			Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics,
			Sophistry and the Alternate
			Universe by Ving Kuda -- You call
			this light reading?
			To each his own, Number One.
			Did I ever mention how imaginative
			Risian women are?
			Too often, Commander.
			Captain, I do have one request.
			You want me to bring you back a
			souvenir?
			It's called a Horga'hn. You won't
			have any trouble finding one.
			Consider it done.
			Sir, I would feel better if you
			would allow me to assign a
			security officer to accompany you.
			We will be out of communication
			range as soon as we leave orbit.
			I don't think that will be
			necessary, Lieutenant. Risa has
			a reputation of being a most
			peaceful planet.
			Aye, sir.
			The ship is yours, Number One.
			Enjoy your trip, Captain.
			I'll try, Counselor.
			He's going to have a great time.
			Pardon me.
			It's so good to see you again.
			I think you've mistaken me for
			someone else.
			You know, I believe you're right.
			Welcome to Risa.
			A simple handshake would have
			sufficed.
			Return.
			My apologies. I fear I have yet
			to master the art of hoverball.
			So it would seem.
			My name is Joval. I am employed
			here. Is there anything you
			require to make your stay a more
			pleasant one?
			You find me amusing.
			No. It's just that you're the
			fifth woman to ask me that this
			morning... All I require is to
			sit here in the sun and read my
			book. Alone.
			And afterward?
			I really haven't thought that far
			ahead.
			Then may I suggest a swim to be
			followed by a massage?
			Some other time perhaps.
			I don't understand. You say you
			wish to be alone yet you carry
			the Horga'hn.
			I just purchased that.
			Why? Are you implying it holds
			some special meaning?
			The Horga'hn is the Risian
			symbol of sexuality. To own
			one is to call forth it powers.
			To display it is to announce you
			are seeking Jamaharohn.
			Riker!
			Do you seek Jamaharohn?
			I don't even know what it means.
			Nor do I want to. The Horga'hn
			is for a friend.
			I see. Someone close to you.
			That's right.
			Someone you love.
			I wouldn't go that far.
			Your attitude is most puzzling.
			I will leave you now to your book.
			That's all I ask.
			You're blocking the sun.
			I know you're working with her.
			I warn you, it's a mistake.
			Are you addressing me?
			Don't bother to deny it. I've
			seen the two of you together.
			I don't know what the devil you're
			talking about. But whatever it
			is, I assure you it's no concern
			of mine.
			Tell her I want the disc returned
			to me immediately.
			Perhaps I haven't made myself
			clear. You have the wrong man.
			I am rapidly losing patience with
			you. I demand you talk business.
			You'll find Ferengi demands carry
			little weight with me.
			Obviously you've never dealt with
			my people before.
			On the contrary, I have. All too
			often.
			Then you know the Ferengi are not
			to be trifled with.
			Or trusted.
			You dare to insult me!
			I advise you to listen closely
			for I will not say this again.
			I came to Risa for a holiday,
			nothing more. I have no knowledge
			of this woman you refer to, nor
			have I laid eyes on any disc.
			You expect me to believe such
			feeble lies?
			I don't particularly care what
			you believe.
			This is not over yet, human. The
			disc is mine... And so is the
			woman. Remember that.
			Hello!
			Oh, it's you.
			That's not much of a greeting.
			Look, I don't mean to appear rude,
			but I am not seeking Jamaharohn.
			All right. But you really should
			try it some time.
			If I "try it", it will be at a
			time of my own choosing.
			That's fine with me. It's not
			as though I was offering to help
			you find it.
			I assumed by the way you welcomed
			me the other day...
			I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
			I don't recall saying I was
			embarrassed.
			Do public displays of affection
			normally make you uncomfortable?
			Let's just say I prefer to be
			acquainted with the women I kiss.
			That's understandable. The name's
			Vash.
			Jean-Luc Picard.
			So tell me about yourself,
			Jean-Luc.
			Is that really necessary?
			Would you rather I guess? I can
			be very persistent.
			I'm captain of a Federation
			starship.
			Well then that explains it.
			Explains what?
			I noticed you arguing with that
			Ferengi. For a moment there it
			looked like it was going to come
			to blows.
			You're the woman he was talking
			about?
			I hope your disagreement wasn't
			over me.
			For the answer to that I suggest
			you ask him.
			Where are you going?
			To find some privacy.
			Wait a second.
			What did he tell you? I'm sure
			there wasn't a bit of truth to
			any of it.
			And you said you didn't know her.
			I don't. And I don't want to.
			Return the disc to me and all will
			be forgiven.
			The disc doesn't belong to you,
			Sovak. It never did.
			It would seem you two have a lot
			to discuss. If you'll excuse
			me...
			I'm sorry, Jean-Luc. Perhaps one
			day I can explain this all to you.
			Perhaps you can.
			I have a proposal I believe you'll
			find most interesting.
			Save your breath.
			I am willing to pay you your
			weight in gold in exchange for
			the disc. Is that not a generous
			offer?
			I must have that woman.
			What are you doing in my room?
			We are Vorgons. I am Ajur. This
			is Boratus.
			We come from the twenty-seventh
			century. We've traveled three
			hundred years into the past to
			find you.
			Let's assume for the moment I
			believe you. That you are indeed
			from the future. What is it that
			you want from me?
			Have you heard of the Tox Uthat?
			I'm aware of the legend. It tells
			of a visitor from the future who
			left behind a mysterious device
			known as the Tox Uthat.
			Essentially that story is correct.
			Then the Uthat actually exists.
			It was invented by a scientist
			named Kal Dano in the mid-twenty-seventh
			century. The Uthat is a
			quantum phase inhibitor... capable
			of halting all nuclear reaction
			within a star.
			But why bring such a powerful
			weapon into the past?
			Criminals attempted to steal the
			device from Dano. He was
			determined to keep it out of their
			hands, so he fled back to the
			twenty-second century... where
			he hid it.
			Ajur and I were the security team
			assigned to protect the Uthat.
			Having failed in our duty, we
			followed Dano into the past,
			hoping to return him and the
			weapon safely to our own time.
			I gather you were unsuccessful.
			Though we searched for many years,
			we were unable to find any trace
			of it.
			Returning home in defeat we began
			to search through the historical
			records for some clue to the
			Uthat's fate.
			For years we looked through the
			archives of the many cultures that
			reside in this part of the galaxy.
			And the search led you to me?
			We came upon a brief account
			stating you had discovered an
			object of unknown origin while
			vacationing on Risa. From its
			description -- a crystal cube that
			fits in the palm of the hand -- we
			surmised it could very well be
			the Uthat.
			I'm sorry to disappoint you, but
			I haven't found a thing -- including
			peace, which is the only thing
			I'm looking for.
			You will find such a device,
			Captain -- to us it's already part
			of history.
			And if I do find it, what then?
			You will give it to us immediately
			so that we may return with it.
			Can we expect your cooperation,
			Picard?
			The Uthat belongs to your time
			-- not mine.
			It would appear that history is
			correct in its assessment of you,
			Captain. You are a very wise man.
			May I come in?
			Excuse the mess.
			Sovak has taken to searching my
			room periodically.
			Is this what he's looking for?
			I'm sorry I had to hide it like
			that, but I was afraid he'd start
			searching me next.
			This disc must contain some very
			valuable information.
			I doubt it's anything you'd be
			interested in.
			That depends.
			On what?
			On whether or not this has
			anything to do with the Tox Uthat.
			Did Sovak tell you that?
			Let's just say I've heard...
			rumors that the Uthat is located
			somewhere on Risa.
			Look, the last thing I need is
			a partner.
			Then it's true.
			I don't suppose you ever heard
			of Professor Samuel Estragon?
			As a matter of fact, I have. He
			spent half his life searching for
			the Uthat.
			Archaeology is a hobby of mine.
			I served as his personal
			assistant for the past five years.
			Shortly before he died, he
			uncovered new data pinpointing
			its location. That disc contains
			his research notes and maps.
			So you're continuing his work?
			Exactly.
			With a Ferengi as an associate.
			Sovak and I are definitely not
			working together.
			But the two of you are well
			acquainted.
			At times he aided the professor
			in his explorations. Especially
			in situations that weren't quite
			ethical.
			And now with typical Ferengi
			logic, he's convinced that the
			Uthat belongs to him.
			All he cares about is selling it
			to the highest bidder.
			I take it you have a more noble
			purpose in mind.
			I told the professor I'd present
			it to the Daystrom Institute.
			But first I have to find it.
			And that won't be easy with Sovak
			watching me every minute.
			Then I'll go in your place.
			And what about me?
			You'll remain here. It's safer.
			This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc.
			And I don't follow orders.
			You'd never find it without me.
			The professor's notes are in code.
			From the moment we met I knew you
			were going to be trouble.
			You look like a man who could
			handle trouble.
			How far is it to our destination?
			According to the professor's notes,
			a series of subterranrean caves lie
			twenty-nine kilometers due east.
			That's where we'll find the Uthat.
			I'll meet you in the lobby in
			fifteen minutes. Be punctual.
			I advise you to change clothing.
			Jean-Luc...
			... We're going to make a wonderful
			team.
			I expected such treachery. Did
			you think you could sneak away
			from me so easily?
			The disc -- where is it?
			Didn't anyone tell you weapons
			aren't allowed on Risa?
			You're making a grave mistake
			putting your trust in this woman.
			It would be a worse mistake to
			trust you.
			Silence!
			Do you know how she acquired the
			disc in the first place?
			Sovak!
			I paid her to steal it. But
			instead she betrayed me, and
			used my money to make her way
			here.
			That's not the way it happened.
			She's a greedy and unscrupulous
			woman.
			A perfect mate for a Ferengi.
			You are becoming quite an
			annoyance, Sovak.
			As are you, human. Perhaps I
			should kill you and then take the
			disc.
			No wait... you can have it.
			You see, I told you we'd make a
			good team.
			We have a long trip ahead of us.
			So it finally begins.
			Picard must not be allowed to
			destroy the Uthat.
			He will surrender it to us...
			or die.
			Have you calculated how much
			further we have to go?
			Another eleven kilometers.
			We'll remain here for the night.
			I was hoping you'd say that.
			We made better time than I
			expected.
			I'll take that as a compliment.
			As it was intended.
			Jean-Luc... I'm afraid I haven't
			been totally honest with you.
			Forgive me if I don't act
			surprised.
			Sovak did pay me to hand over the
			disc.
			Then you did steal it.
			It wasn't stealing. The professor
			was dead... Someone had to
			continue his work. I had already
			devoted five years of my life to
			tracking down the Uthat.
			But you took Sovak's money.
			It was the only way I could afford
			to get to Risa. As for Sovak,
			he got exactly what he deserved.
			Well, any woman who can beat a
			Ferengi at his own game, bears
			watching.
			I'll take that as another
			compliment. I am flattered.
			We should get some sleep.
			You know Jean-Luc, it's lucky for
			you we met.
			If it wasn't for me, you'd still
			be back there sitting in the
			sun... relaxing.
			That happens to be why I came to
			Risa.
			I'm sure you hated every minute
			of it. That kind of vacation isn't
			for a man like you. You need
			excitement.
			Excitement? Sleeping in a damp
			cave... chasing after something
			we'll probably never find?
			You are enjoying yourself, aren't
			you?
			I suppose I am.
			I just wanted to hear you say it.
			Good. Now go to sleep.
			I'll never forget that look on
			your face when you thought I was
			offering you Jamaharon.
			That was a simple
			misunderstanding.
			You did seem a little disappointed
			when I turned you down.
			You can be the most irritating
			woman sometimes.
			You're kind of prickly yourself.
			Don't you see, we're a lot alike.
			That's probably why we get along
			so well.
			You call this getting along?
			All right. We don't get along.
			But you do admit we're attracted
			to one another.
			Do I?
			If you want to pretend otherwise,
			that's fine with me, but...
			You still think I'm trouble?
			I'm sure of it.
			This is it. We've reached the
			end of our journey.
			Do you have an exact location?
			Six meters in from the large
			outcropping.
			That should put it right about
			here.
			Is something wrong?
			I can't get a reading. There must
			be Starithium ore in these rocks.
			That leaves us but one
			alternative.
			Shall we?
			Picard!
			A bit early, aren't you?
			We are here to witness a great
			moment, Picard.
			Who the hell are they?
			They're security officers from
			the twenty-seventh century.
			They're here to take back the
			Uthat.
			You knew about this and didn't
			tell me?
			My apologies Vash... But if I
			had told you, would you have
			brought me here?
			Probably not.
			My point exactly.
			So the betrayer is herself
			betrayed.
			You've put together quite a little
			team.
			You must not interrupt Captain
			Picard...
			Quiet. Move back with the
			others.
			How did you get here?
			I found the disc in her room.
			That's impossible. I made a copy
			as a precaution. But I burned
			it before we left.
			Only the outer casing was
			incinerated. Now, I had no
			intention of interrupting you.
			Please...
			Continue digging.
			No one told you to stop digging,
			human.
			I see no reason to continue.
			You will do as I say. Now pick
			up that shovel!
			Look around Sovak, by now it must
			be obvious even to you... the
			Uthat is not here.
			Is this some pathetic attempt at
			trickery? Of course it's here.
			We simply haven't found it yet.
			Are you saying the professor's
			findings were wrong?
			It would appear so.
			But how could that be? His
			evidence was overwhelming.
			Enough with this foolishness.
			Can't you see he's trying to
			deceive us?
			Return to work this instant!
			I'm afraid he's right, Sovak.
			According to the disc we should
			have reached it hours ago.
			Lies! Treachery! This cannot
			be happening. Not another
			failure. Not after having come
			so close.
			It is most puzzling.
			It's over, Sovak.
			No, I will not be cheated out of
			my prize.
			Tell him. Tell him the
			professor's research is
			irrefutable.
			I... I don't know anymore...
			Then step aside...
			The Uthat is here... somewhere...
			Just waiting to be found... It
			can't hide from me forever.
			Five years of my life... wasted.
			There are other treasures to be
			found, Vash.
			Not like the Uthat.
			I hope you won't mind... but I
			need to be alone for awhile.
			I quite understand.
			Enterprise to Picard.
			Picard here.
			I hope we're not interrupting
			anything important, Captain. I
			just wanted to inform you that
			we have achieved orbit around Risa
			and are ready to beam you up at
			your convenience.
			I will be returning shortly,
			Commander. In the interim, stand
			ready to initiate Transporter Code
			Fourteen at my signal.
			Transporter Code Fourteen?
			You heard me, Number One.
			Yes, sir.
			Picard out.
			Leaving so soon?
			Jean-Luc -- I was just about to
			come say good-bye.
			Well then, I've saved you the
			bother.
			I want to put all this behind me
			as soon as possible. You
			understand.
			Of course. However, there is one
			last thing you can do for me.
			Anything.
			Show me where you've hidden the
			Tox Uthat.
			That's not funny, Jean-Luc.
			You never intended to burn that
			second disc. If you had, you
			wouldn't have been so careless
			as to allow Sovak to salvage any
			of it. You wanted him to follow
			us so he could see for himself
			that the Uthat wasn't at the cave
			site. It was the only way to
			convince him your quest had been
			futile.
			But how could I have known the
			Uthat wasn't there?
			Because you had gone there once
			before. Probably the moment you
			arrived on the planet. That's
			when you found it.
			You're a man of many talents,
			Jean-Luc.
			Open it.
			A piece of the future.
			A very dangerous piece. Were you
			really going to give it to the
			Daystom Institute?
			Well, maybe not give it.
			Five years is a huge investment,
			Jean-Luc. I deserve to make a
			reasonable profit.
			Congratulations Picard. We knew
			you would not fail us.
			You're not going to just hand
			it over are you?
			You didn't trust me... what makes
			you think you can trust them?
			I assume the Vorgons have proof
			to back up their claims.
			Our being here is proof enough.
			Wait a second, Vorgons?
			According to the professor's
			notes, it was two Vorgons... a
			male and a female... who tried
			to steal the Uthat in the first
			place. For all we know it could
			be them.
			You're going to have to prove
			you are who you say you are.
			As you yourself said, the Uthat
			belongs to the future.
			But not necessarily to you.
			You will return what is ours,
			Picard.
			No!
			Enterprise... Code Fourteen...
			Lock on present coordinates...
			three second delay... Mark!
			Are you all right?
			Go. Return to your own time.
			There's nothing for you here.
			History recorded that you
			destroyed the Uthat.
			You have fulfilled your destiny
			all too well, Picard.
			I don't suppose there are any
			openings for an archaeologist
			aboard the Enterprise.
			Somehow I doubt you'd find life
			aboard a starship suitable to your
			taste.
			Probably not. I could never
			tolerate all that discipline.
			What are your plans?
			I thought I'd explore the ruins
			on Sarthong Five. No telling what
			I might find there.
			But the Sarthongians deal harshly
			with trespassers.
			Why Jean-Luc, you really do care
			about me.
			You will try and stay out of
			trouble.
			I always try.
			I wish we had more time together.
			Perhaps we do.
			The Vorgons are time travelers.
			Now that they know where and when
			the Uthat can be found, they may
			very well come back and try for
			it again.
			So we may be doing this all over
			again.
			Good-bye Jean-Luc.
			Picard to Transporter Room. One
			to beam up.
			Welcome aboard, Captain.
			Thank you, Commander. Status
			report.
			All went well on Starbase twelve.
			I think you'll find the ship to
			be in splendid condition.
			I'll present my compliments to
			the crew. Oh yes... and Number
			One... about that Horga'hn you
			requested.
			Yes, sir...
			We need to have a little chat
			about that.
			Was it a relaxing trip, Captain?
			I knew he'd have a great time.
			Welcome to Risa. All that is ours
			is yours.
			We are looking for the lodging
			chamber of Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard.
			A file scan reveals no record of
			a Captain Picard currently
			visiting Risa.
			We're early.
			Again.
