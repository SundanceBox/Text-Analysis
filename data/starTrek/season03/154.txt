			Another Coco-no-no?
			No thanks, I think I've had enough
			already.
			Yeah, me too.
			Geordi...
			What?
			I'm sorry. I think I better go
			back now.
			You're chilly... ? I can turn down
			the breeze...
			No, it's been a lovely program,
			and you're a terrific guy...
			Yeah...
			I just don't feel that way about
			you...
			Yeah...
			Knock it off.
			Do you require full termination
			of the Holodeck program or just
			the audio portion?
			This was the final battle, wasn't
			it?
			Neither side intended Orelious
			Nine to be the decisive conflict.
			Not much of it left, is there...
			The destruction is remarkable
			considering the primitive weapons
			of the period.
			Uh oh...
			I beg your pardon, Wesley?
			"Uh oh"... it's an expression,
			Data. It just means, you know,
			uh oh, something's wrong...
			There is something wrong?
			Commander La Forge had a big date
			with Christy tonight. He's been
			working on the perfect program
			for days. Looks like it ended
			kinda early.
			Uh oh.
			Commander Data to the bridge
			immediately.
			Acknowledged.
			We're picking up a signal,
			coordinates two-one-one mark
			six-one.
			It is an ancient interplanetary
			code.
			Survivors on Orelious Nine after
			all this time... not possible.
			Not at all possible. Lay in a
			course to the source of the
			signal.
			Approaching the source, Captain...
			Put it on the viewer, Mister Data.
			A Promellian battle cruiser.
			And with its Lang Cycle fusion
			engines intact.
			Scanners indicate no life signs
			aboard.
			I should hope not. That ship
			belongs in a museum.
			Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're a
			little late. This call for help
			was very likely initiated over
			a thousand years ago.
			Captain's log, Stardate 43799.1.
			We have arrived at Orelious Nine,
			to chart the battle in which the
			Menthars and Promellians fought
			to their mutual extinction. Among
			the ruins we have found a relic:
			a Promellian battle cruiser that
			has withstood the centuries.
			Indulge me, Number One...
			I'd prefer Lieutenant Worf and
			I did a security sweep of the
			vessel first...
			No. Captain's prerogative, here.
			This one's mine. We've examined
			every conceivable risk...
			The risks aboard a vessel this
			old and fragile are inconceivable,
			Captain...
			Ghosts, perhaps?
			Haven't you ever dreamed of
			climbing inside the bottle... ?
			Sir... ?
			The ship in the bottle, Number
			One. Model air ships... I used
			to build them as a child. By God,
			I'll bet I even had a Promellian
			battle cruiser too.
			Ready to beam the away team to
			the vessel...
			Locked on to the Main Bridge,
			Captain...
			You're certain about the
			atmospheric conditions, Data... ?
			There is adequate oxygen for life
			support, Commander...
			It is exactly as they left it,
			Number One. In the bottle.
			Good Lord, didn't anyone else here
			build ships in bottles when they
			were boys?
			I did not play with toys.
			I was never a boy.
			I did, sir.
			Thank you, Mister O'Brien.
			Proceed.
			I did. I really did. Ships in
			bottles. Great fun.
			What's that?
			Not sure. The secondary power
			bus may need adjusting.
			Let me know.
			Extraordinary. You would expect
			the layout of a bridge from this
			era to be clumsy, awkward... but
			see this -- it is a model of
			simplicity. They built the same
			craft for generations. And it
			worked.
			Admirable. They died at their
			posts.
			Don't you have anything stronger
			than this, Guinan?
			Yes.
			Would it help?
			No.
			Can you tell me something, Guinan?
			You're a woman, right?
			Yes, I can tell you that.
			What is it that... you want in
			a man?
			Me personally?
			As a woman. What's the first
			thing you look at?
			His head.
			Uh huh... his mind, of course.
			No, his head. I'm attracted to
			bald men.
			Seriously?
			Seriously.
			Why?
			Maybe because a bald man was very
			kind to me once... when I was
			hurting. Took care of me.
			I'd like to do that.
			I'm taking care of myself these
			days.
			I mean take care of somebody.
			Guinan, I just don't get it...
			I can field strip a fusion
			reactor... I can realign a power
			transfer tunnel... why can't I
			make anything work with a woman
			like Christy? I don't know what
			to do, what to say...
			I never noticed... as a woman.
			You're different.
			No, you're different.
			But I'm not trying now.
			Exactly.
			The source of the distress signal
			is twenty meters ahead...
			Mister Worf, be sure we get
			tricorder images of their tactical
			display...
			Yes, sir.
			Look here, Worf... how well laid
			out it is. We went through how
			many different designs before
			we reached this kind of
			sophistication... ?
			I believe it was four, sir. We
			did not have a fully integrated
			tactical command until the
			twenty-third century. In fact,
			several of the Promellian
			innovations served as inspiration
			for early Federation starship
			design...
			As well they should have.
			Positron ducts. These channeled
			power from one end of the ship
			to the other.
			It is safe to enter.
			Let's put an end to their last
			cry for help.
			Captain...
			I believe this is an information
			storage device... a crude analogue
			of our own iso-linear optical
			chip.
			Crude by our standards today,
			Data. When this ship was built,
			humans on Earth had just perfected
			the mechanical clock... and were
			using steel crossbows in battle.
			Is there any way to see what's
			on this?
			Questionable. I can supply power
			to the playback unit, Captain...
			but the components are quite
			old... I will attempt to amplify
			its image with a tricorder...
			What is it, Wes?
			The main power return is acting
			a little weird...
			Define "weird".
			I'm getting fluctuating waveguide
			readings...
			Run a maintenance sweep.
			Right.
			I am Galek Sar, Captain of the
			Promellian cruiser, Cleponji.
			I wish anyone who finds this
			record to know my crew has behaved
			courageously.
			I want it recorded for all time
			that I, alone, am responsible for
			the fate that befell us.
			I have failed -- as a captain.
			And as the man responsible for
			all the souls aboard my ship.
			Indeed, sir.
			Picard to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Captain.
			I think we've seen just about all
			there is to see here. At Mister
			O'Brien's convenience... we are
			ready to return...
			Aye, sir.
			You were absolutely right, Number
			One. There were ghosts aboard
			the old ship after all... one of
			them even spoke to us.
			A friendly one, I hope.
			My own counterpart. The ship
			captain's final message...
			praising his crew.
			I hope you'll be as thoughtful
			when the time comes.
			Data, advise the Astral-Five annex
			of the Smithsonian... This should
			be catalogued and scheduled for
			retrieval...
			I'm sorry... it's just a rare
			pleasure to meet this side of your
			personality, Captain.
			Mister Crusher, set our course
			for the original coordinates.
			Yessir.
			Captain, we are experiencing a two
			percent drop in our energy
			reserves. Compensating.
			We were having a few problems
			while...
			Readouts indicate we are being
			bombarded with a field of high
			intensity radiation.
			Shields up.
			Captain, energy loss increasing
			to five percent. I am unable to
			correct.
			Yellow Alert.
			Maybe I should've gone with the
			Mardi Gras program... something
			a little livelier...
			You ever consider doing it
			without a program?
			You're a pilot... Try flying
			without instruments for a
			change... you might surprise
			yourself.
			Mister La Forge, report to
			Engineering...
			On my way, Commander.
			Save my seat, Guinan.
			Always room at the bar for another
			broken heart.
			Energy loss increasing.
			Mister Crusher, reverse course.
			Full impulse power.
			Sir, there's no response.
			Increase speed to warp one.
			Engines are not responding, sir.
			Mister La Forge, I need warp power
			now!
			Matter/anti-matter mixture ratio
			settings at optimum balance...
			Reaction sequence corresponding
			to specified norms... Magnetic
			plasma transfer to warp field
			generators per program specs.
			Commander, we should be going
			like a bat out of hell.
			Power loss now at twelve percent.
			Red Alert.
			Radiation intensity increasing.
			We better slow these engines down
			before we burn out the reaction
			chamber.
			Slow to idle, Geordi.
			Is it possible... have we stumbled
			into the same snare that killed
			them? A thousand-year-old...
			booby trap?
			With the engines idling, the
			energy loss has been limited.
			But our reserves will be depleted
			in less than three hours. We
			won't be able to hold our shields
			in place.
			If we lose shields, the radiation
			will kill everyone on board,
			Captain.
			Not everyone, Doctor.
			I stand corrected.
			Have you identified the source
			of the radiation, Mister Worf?
			No, sir. The radiation field is
			too strong -- it interferes with
			our sensors.
			And no apparent explanation for
			the loss of energy... ?
			Anything in the history books,
			Data that might give us a clue... ?
			There are many fascinating records
			of Menthar battle strategy...
			they were exceptionally
			innovative. In fact, they were
			the first to devise the Kavis Teke
			elusive maneuver as well as a
			Passive Lure stratagem that is
			comparable to Napoleon's...
			Any mention of a situation like
			this?
			No.
			Recommend I lead an away team to
			the cruiser.
			They didn't have much success with
			this problem, Commander...
			But at least they knew their enemy
			better than we do. Maybe they
			even knew how they got into
			trouble... they just didn't know
			how to get out.
			Agreed. Worf, what would be the
			impact of lowering shields long
			enough to get an away team out... ?
			Negligible, sir.
			It won't help our energy
			conservation any, Captain.
			That's your job, Commander La
			Forge. Determine a way to keep
			the Enterprise up and running.
			Data, you will join Commander
			Riker on the away team. Find out
			what happened to that ship.
			Radiation factor is within safe
			human limits, Commander.
			Why isn't this ship being hit with
			radiation?
			That is curious, Commander. The
			radiation field must be
			directional in nature... aimed
			only at the Enterprise.
			Maybe our own engines triggered
			it somehow...
			Data, see if you can determine
			what kind of defenses the
			Promellians tried to employ...
			I don't want to waste time trying
			them again...
			Understood.
			What'd really help us is a ship's
			log... any kind of record of their
			last battle.
			So why can't we move?
			Computer, as we increased our
			power levels, was there any
			counter-reaction?
			Affirmative. The opposing force
			grew in direct proportion to the
			power output of the Enterprise.
			So it kept us from forming a
			subspace field for the warp drive?
			That is correct.
			Computer, who is this L. Brahms?
			Doctor Leah Brahms. Engineer.
			Graduate of the Daystrom
			Institute. Theoretical Propulsion
			Group, Galaxy class starships.
			Team seven, junior member.
			Junior member, huh. Looks like
			she wrote the book on propulsion.
			Call up subspace design logs...
			Select menu, visual records or
			L. Brahms' voice entries.
			Voice entries.
			Theoretical propulsion logs,
			Federation Starship Enterprise,
			Galaxy class. Heading: Subspace.
			Author: Leah Brahms.
			Geordi La Forge. How ya doin,
			Doc...
			Yeah, down to work. You're
			absolutely right.
			I recommend we evacuate and seal
			off all non-operational areas and
			group the families and crew on
			odd-numbered decks.
			Proceed.
			I'd also like to set up an
			assembly area for treating
			radiation in case we need it.
			After the shields fall, how long
			for a fatal exposure?
			Thirty minutes. After that,
			there's nothing that can be done.
			Away team to bridge. Captain, we
			may have found something...
			We're in the Promellian
			communications area...
			There's a file of memory coils
			here...
			They are identical to the coil
			we found earlier, Captain...
			Their captain's log, perhaps?
			That's what we were thinking.
			Data, are the coils in working
			condition?
			I believe so. We can enhance them
			through the image processor in
			the ship's computer.
			Good. Return at once.
			What about the dilithium crystal
			control?
			It should be possible to fine tune
			the frequency ranges...
			Yes?
			And the propulsion group is
			investigating numerous theories
			to determine how.
			Great. Thanks a lot. Computer,
			generate a cross section image
			of the dilithium crystal chamber.
			What about reorienting the
			crystal?
			It is possible to reorient the
			crystal. The key lies in
			adjusting the lattice structure
			direction. This modification will
			be integrated into the next class
			starship.
			Sorry, can't wait. You and me,
			Leah. We have two hours to figure
			this out.
			You know what I need to do -- I
			need to get inside there. I need
			to turn that thing inside out...
			Computer, is there a cross section
			of the engines we can replicate
			on a Holodeck?
			Select menu: design specifications
			or prototype schematic.
			Prototype? Elaborate...
			A development stage prototype
			schematic at Utopia Planitia,
			drafting room five, of the Mars
			Station, Stardate 40174.
			Perfect. Recreate it in Holodeck
			Three. Stay with me, Doc.
			Ready computer?
			Holodeck Three program is ready.
			Damn. Right back where it all
			started. This is incredible...
			Leah, did you design this?
			The dilithium crystal chamber was
			designed at outpost designated
			Seran-T-one, Stardate 40052...
			Some of the Federation's best
			engineering minds participated
			in its development.
			Sure, that's visiting dignitary
			talk, what's the inside story...
			off-the-record?
			Access denied. Personal logs are
			restricted.
			Another woman who won't get
			personal with me in the Holodeck.
			Leah, I want to find a way to
			supplement the energy supply to
			the ship and to the engines.
			Could we alter the matter/anti-matter
			paths?
			Theoretically, yes. The system
			should be able to accept more
			reactants at a faster rate of
			injection.
			Well, this is your baby, show me
			which ones...
			Computer, did I ask for a
			simulation?
			Affirmative. You asked Doctor
			Brahms to show you which system
			could accept reactants at a faster
			rate. By accessing available
			imagery, an adequate facsimile
			was possible.
			I did do that, didn't I?
			Okay... Leah... good to see you...
			Real good.
			Continue your analysis.
			Systems L-452 through L-575 will
			accept reactants, providing all
			other systems are calibrated to
			an equal factor.
			Then, if we use multiple injector
			streams, hitting more than one
			crystal facet, we could do it...
			we could hold our own. Leah,
			you're beautiful.
			La Forge to Picard....
			Go ahead.
			Captain, we've found a way to
			extend the matter/anti-matter
			energy supplies.
			Well done, Mister La Forge.
			Geordi, can you give us enough
			energy to get us out of here?
			Sorry, Commander... we haven't
			addressed that one yet. First
			priority was to maintain shields.
			Acknowledged.
			We'll get on it, right away,
			though...
			Pass on my congratulations to your
			team, Commander.
			Thanks, Captain. We're... all
			smiles down here.
			Picard out.
			We have been able to verify that
			these coils are logs of the
			Promellian captain... but most
			of them have decayed and cannot
			be repaired...
			They're beyond any sort of
			playback... ?
			On most there are brief sections
			that may yield some information.
			Do the best you can, Data. Let's
			just hope we have the brief
			section we need...
			He must have logged the cause of
			his ship's death. What captain
			wouldn't?
			They were all in an open locker.
			I don't think he was too concerned
			with security.
			... 452 through system L-575.
			Adjustments to dilithium crystal
			chamber complete.
			Impact analysis, computer.
			Warp energy has increased fourteen
			percent. Reactants per unit time
			remaining steady.
			All right.
			Computer, do you have any... you
			know... personality... on file
			for Doctor Brahms?
			Starfleet personality profile
			analysis, stardate 37650...
			Did she ever debate at the
			intergalactic caucuses on
			Chaya-seven?
			Doctor Brahms attended Chaya-seven
			caucuses on the following
			stardates...
			Never mind the dates...
			Computer, if you add all data
			from these sources, could you
			synthesize a true representation
			of Doctor Brahms?
			There would be a nine-point-three
			percent margin of error in the
			interactive responses from the
			facsimile.
			I can live with that. Make it
			happen.
			Doctor Brahms?
			Geordi, it's me, Leah. Don't
			start calling me "Doctor Brahms"
			or I'll call you "Commander" La
			Forge.
			Right.
			Now, we've managed to maintain
			energy but we can't leave it in
			this realignment forever without
			burning out components so we need
			to move quickly...
			Are you with me?
			Right.
			... have been stripped of all
			propulsion, and our weapons are
			useless. We can't move -- and
			we can't fight. The ship is being
			lashed with lethal radiation from
			the Aceton assimilators concealed
			in the rubble surrounding....
			Aceton assimilators -- ?
			An Aceton assimilator is a
			primitive generator which can
			drain power from distant sources.
			Generator...
			It would not be difficult to
			modify them to convert energy into
			radiation.
			The Menthars hide them in the
			floating debris... and an
			unsuspecting enemy ship flies
			in... instant booby trap.
			And now we're supplying the
			devices with the energy to kill
			us.
			No... no... no...
			Will you listen to me...
			You can't boost the warp power
			that way...
			If you can just increase the speed
			of the parallel subspace field
			processor to gain a quicker
			response time...
			I want to give us enough power
			to strengthen the shields and
			barrel out of here... not blow
			us up...
			This is my design we're talking
			about. I did all the calculations
			myself.
			I don't care if you built it with
			your bare hands out of an old
			Ferengi cargo ship, it's going
			to go --
			-- and we're going with it.
			I'm not used to having people
			question my judgment.
			And I'm not used to dying.
			You worked in a lab on a static
			model. This is a working machine,
			it has tens of thousands of
			light years on it.
			True.
			Damn right.
			We'd never be certain the circuit
			paths are sealed.
			You're good. Very good.
			I know my ship. Inside and out.
			Then I guess you know me. Inside
			and out. Cause a lot of me is
			in here.
			I always wished the chief engineer
			could be present when a ship is
			being built.
			And that's what's wrong with
			designers -- we never get out in
			space.
			You're there now.
			Commander La Forge to the bridge.
			On my way, Commander.
			Don't go anywhere.
			I mean, computer -- save program.
			How many of these devices do we
			think we're dealing with?
			To create the radiation field we
			are experiencing, it would take
			several hundred thousand, Captain...
			They've been out there a long
			time, Data... there must be some
			deterioration....
			There is no way to calculate that
			precisely, Commander... but it
			is likely...
			Is there any indication of a
			weakness in a specific part of
			the field...
			Nothing substantial, Captain.
			Of any kind.
			A point-one percent dip in the
			strength of the radiation field
			at two-one mark eight by
			four-two mark zero...
			I'll take that point-one percent.
			Recommend we fire a directional
			phaser pattern at those
			coordinates...
			We won't be able to maintain
			energy reserves... we might even
			lose some circuits in the new
			configuration...
			How critical would the losses be?
			Not enough to shut down our
			engines... but if we don't make
			it... I don't know if we could
			hold shields.
			There is also the possibility the
			phasers will supply the
			assimilators with what they need
			most -- energy.
			Mister La Forge, alternative
			suggestions?
			Maybe down the road, Captain...
			But we can't overload the
			dilithium crystals much longer.
			I imagine a discussion very much
			like this took place on our
			neighbor's ship a thousand years
			ago. May our decisions meet with
			more success than theirs.
			Mister La Forge, you will return
			to Engineering and continue your
			efforts without delay. Mister
			Worf, prepare the phasers.
			Phasers locked on coordinates.
			Fire.
			Nothing.
			Radiation levels increasing,
			Captain. Eight percent. Ten
			percent.
			Energy reserves on board dropping
			rapidly...
			Damn you.
			Wouldn't that increase the output
			of the parallel subspace
			processors to gain a quicker
			response time... ?
			The processors can handle the
			extra input.
			Yeah, but how do we
			reconfigure... ?
			Energy reserves reaching critical
			stage. Standard procedure
			requires termination of all
			simulations.
			Computer, override standard
			procedure...
			Override authority restricted.
			What? -- computer --
			The crystal lattice is breaking
			down...
			We'll have to pick up repairs when
			we can reach a starbase....
			The optimist in the group.
			How long do we have shields based
			on current calculations... ?
			Under two hours, Captain. And
			the radiation field has
			increased by seventeen percent.
			Impact on fatal exposure?
			Down to twenty-six minutes.
			If we resist, we die. If we don't
			resist, we die.
			Mister La Forge, have we shut down
			all non-essential energy usage?
			Yes, Captain. In fact, I need
			to get some back... I'm running
			a program on Holodeck Three...
			For what purpose?
			I've gone back to the beginning...
			to the earliest construction
			entries of the Enterprise. I've
			created... a... propulsion design
			model to assist me. I believe
			we're... making progress...
			Computer, reinstate Holodeck Three
			program.
			Holodeck Three program is
			reinstated.
			Your best suggestion in an hour,
			Mister La Forge. Picard out.
			Computer, resume Holodeck Three
			program.
			Enter when ready.
			There isn't much time left.
			Somehow, we have to generate
			enough energy to get out of
			here... but we've got a
			booby-trap that eats energy for
			breakfast... how do we fool it,
			block it, shut it down,
			anything...
			Okay, we know for every movement
			the Enterprise makes, there's a
			counter-movement from the energy
			field... could we use that to our
			advantage somehow...
			Maybe. There must be a time
			differential between the force
			and counter-force response...
			If we could make quick, continuing
			adjustments in the linkups before
			the counterforce reacts, we might
			just be able to move this
			bucket...
			Yes...
			Leah, you like Italian food?
			Like it? Wait til I make you my
			fungilli.
			Okay, fusion reactor uplink to
			navigation processor...
			But then we have to adjust the
			drive coils... and the vector
			processor... it's impossible..
			Don't do that...
			Sorry... I thought it might feel
			good.
			I don't want to feel that good
			right now. What time is it?
			Coming up on sixteen hundred
			hours.
			God, what am I supposed to tell
			the Captain?
			It's possible and yet it's
			impossible... everything we've
			done says we can't adjust fast
			enough... but if we could, it
			might work...
			I could do it.
			Data couldn't even do it. It'll
			take a hundred... maybe even a
			thousand adjustments every
			second... how are you gonna do
			it? It's humanly impossible.
			I'm not human.
			You mean the computer could do
			it.
			Captain, this is... a holographic
			simulation of one of the
			propulsion experts who designed
			the Enterprise engines... Leah
			Brahms. Doctor Leah Brahms.
			We... I've been examining the
			force and counter-force response
			time... and trying to see if we
			could create linkage at maximum
			power...
			The bottom line, Commander.
			There's a chance we could manuever
			out of the trap... if we turn the
			ship over to the computer.
			What kind of chance?
			I don't know yet. But we can
			program it and try it out on a
			few simulated runs.
			Proceed.
			This is the only way...
			I think so, Captain.
			Come.
			Any word from La Forge?
			He's come up with something that
			might give us a chance. If we
			agree to stay out of it.
			Sir?
			He proposes to turn control of
			the ship over to the computer
			because it is capable of making
			quicker adjustments than any human
			being.
			Computers have always impressed
			me by their ability to take
			orders; I'm not at all as certain
			about their ability to give them.
			Especially with a thousand lives
			at stake.
			What choice do I have?
			You missed something by not
			playing with model ships. They
			were the source of one boy's
			imaginary voyages, each holding
			a treasure of adventures. Manning
			the earliest space craft. Or
			flying a plane with only one
			propeller to keep you in the sky.
			Imagine that.
			Now, the machines are flying us.
			Fatal radiation exposure.
			Computer, reduce thrust levels
			another four percent... adjust
			trajectory angle to compensate...
			begin simulation again...
			There you go. We got out.
			Repeat simulation, same levels.
			Fatal radiation exposure.
			Swell. Same variables. Only
			this time the computer didn't
			quite make it...
			Deflector shield failure. Lethal
			radiation levels. Fatal exposure
			in twenty-six minutes.
			Deflector shield failure. Lethal
			radiation levels. Fatal exposure
			in twenty-three minutes.
			I can't do it.
			It might work, Geordi.
			And it might not. I can't
			ask the captain to turn the ship
			over to a computer.
			It's all we've got.
			Picard to La Forge.
			Captain... two minutes... give
			me just two minutes....
			There is another way, Captain...
			two minutes...
			Two minutes. Picard out.
			Geordi, there's no other way...
			No..no... wait, listen... turn
			it upside down, literally... come
			at it from the opposite
			direction... God, it's so
			simple... it might even work...
			Lethal levels of radiation...
			Computer, shut up... at least in

			Computer, new simulation...
			Everything we've been trying to
			do is based on overpowering the
			trap... more energy, faster
			adjustments... but that's exactly
			what we can't do, because that's
			what we're supposed to do. That's
			the booby trap.
			The answer is in our own
			computer... the mind -- the best
			piece of engineering we'll ever
			need.
			Didn't your research suggest
			thousands of adjustments would
			be required per second?
			Not if we turn everything off.
			One blast of everything we've got
			left for a microsecond to beat
			the inertia and then we shut it
			all down except minimal life
			support and two thrusters. No
			impulse engines. No computer.
			One propeller, Captain...
			Deflector shield failure. Lethal
			radiation levels. Fatal exposure
			in twelve minutes.
			Have you analyzed the risk factor?
			The numbers say it's even money.
			No better than handing it over to
			the computer. No worse either.
			But I say forget the numbers.
			There's no way for a computer to
			compensate for the human factor...
			the intuition, the experience...
			Make it ready.
			I've run the simulations... If
			you want me to take Conn...
			No, Mister La Forge. You've done
			your job. Now I must do mine.
			I relieve you, Mister Crusher.
			Yes, sir.
			All hands, this is Commander
			Riker. We are about to engage
			impulse engines for a short burst.
			Inertial dampers are on manual.
			They may not fully compensate for
			acceleration. Brace yourselves.
			Deflector shield failure. Lethal
			radiation levels. Fatal --
			Computer, discontinue radiation

			Firing impulse engines.
			Impulse engines are now down.
			Shutting down all systems.
			Velocity is one hundred thirty

			We will enter the debris field

			Coming to heading three-four-zero

			Captain, that large mass to port

			Port thruster firing...
			No reaction from the assimilator.
			We're past the first hurdle.
			Sir! Object to port --
			Starboard thruster.
			Sir, the gravitational attraction
			of the various masses has reduced
			our velocity by eight percent.
			By my calculations, we no longer
			possess sufficient momentum to
			clear the debris field --
			Thank you, Mister Data.
			Port thruster...
			The asteroid's gravity is drawing
			us closer. Velocity increasing.
			Velocity still increasing... now
			two hundred and nineteen meters
			per second.
			Starboard thruster.
			You have used the asteroid's
			gravitational pull as a
			slingshot. Excellent.
			We're out. We beat it.
			Mister Crusher, the conn is yours.
			Yes, sir!
			Initiate full restart. Bring all
			systems back on-line.
			With pleasure, sir.
			Number One... make sure the booby
			trap won't bother anyone again.
			Mister Worf, ready photon
			torpedoes, all bays... set to
			detonate upon impact with the
			Promellian vessel.
			Aye, sir.
			I've always thought that
			technology could solve any
			problem. It enhances our quality
			of life... It lets us travel
			across the galaxy... It even gave
			me my vision.
			But sometimes you just need to
			trust yourself and turn it all
			off. Even the gypsy violins.
			Violins?
			Different program. Sorry.
			We made a good team.
			Maybe we could do it again some
			time.
			I'm with you every day, Geordi.
			Every time you look at this
			engine, you're looking at me.
			Every time you touch it, it's me.
			Computer, exit Holodeck. Save
