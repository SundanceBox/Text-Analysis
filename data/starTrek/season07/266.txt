			Most people on this colony will
			remember my grandmother as a
			"healer"... but her abilities
			went beyond that. She didn't just
			relieve pain, or fight illness...
			because she knew that well-being
			is more than a healthy body. Her
			remedies included words of advice
			as often as they did medicinal
			teas...
			And sometimes they were just as
			bitter-tasting.
			But Nana's favorite thing was
			cooking. My most vivid memories
			growing up were of Nana in the
			kitchen... the sounds of bubbling
			pots and wooden spoons... the
			exotic tastes and smells...
			In fact, she was in the middle of
			writing a cook book when she died.
			I'd like to share with you one of
			her recipes... it was my favorite.
			"Nana's Gingerbread. Mix one gram
			currants... six hundred
			milliliters of flour... two
			hundred milliliters buttermilk...
			and a dollop of molasses... "
			"Two pinches of ginger and
			cinnamon... and two hundred
			milliliters of sugar."
			"Heat the oven until it's happy...
			then pour the batter into the arms
			of a welcoming pan... "
			I never knew when an oven was
			happy, and I never saw arms on a
			pan... but it sure tasted great.
			I'll miss Felisa Howard very
			much... her healing... her
			advice... and most of all, her
			gingerbread.
			"And so now we commit her body to
			the ground; earth to earth, ashes
			to ashes, dust to dust... in sure
			and certain hope that her memory
			will be kept alive within us all."
			How long are you planning to stay?
			Just a few more hours. Why?
			Well, as I'm sure you know, Caldos
			was one of the first terraforming
			projects of the Federation. Some
			of our weather controls and fusion
			systems are nearly a century old.
			I wouldn't mind having a starship
			Engineer take a look at them...
			perhaps give us a few upgrades.
			Maybe in exchange for a tour of
			the colony... and a home-cooked
			meal?
			We're due at Starbase six-two-one
			tomorrow morning... but we can
			delay that for a few days. Yes...
			I'm sure we can find some time.
			Excellent.
			I look forward to that tour. The
			Caldos Colony is really an
			impressive accomplishment. I
			actually feel like I'm in the
			Scottish Highlands.
			That was the intent. The
			cornerstone of every building in
			town was brought from Edinburgh..
			Glasgow... Aberdeen... The
			founders wanted everyone to have
			a piece of the real thing here.
			They didn't just want to imitate
			Scotland -- they wanted to
			recreate it.
			I'm curious, Governor... you're
			obviously not from Scotland. What
			drew you here?
			There's something about the
			culture... the heritage. When I
			was a boy, my family visited
			Glamis Castle in Scotland. As I
			looked out across the highlands,
			I felt as if I'd come home.
			I thought it was a beautiful
			eulogy, Beverly.
			Thank you.
			You know, I never realized how
			many friends Nana had...
			Did you come home often?
			Not really. After I married Jack
			and moved to Earth... I never
			seemed to get back here...
			Deanna... did you notice a
			peculiar man at the service? He
			looked like he was in his midthirties...
			dark hair?
			No...
			He threw a flower on Nana's
			grave... a camellia... it was her
			favorite flower. She used to keep
			them all over the house.
			Maybe he was a friend... or one of
			her patients.
			Maybe. It was just such a
			personal gesture... and he gave me
			the oddest look...
			Well... I suppose I should go back
			to the house. There are some
			things there I'd like to take care
			of.
			It's only a few minutes away.
			Would you mind coming along?
			I'd love to.
			Your grandmother had remarkable
			green eyes...
			Every woman in the Howard family
			has had green eyes... except for
			my mother and me.
			How well do you remember your
			mother?
			Not very well... I was so young
			when she died. I just have the
			image of her face... and I can
			hear the sound of her voice, but
			I can't tell you anything specific
			she ever said...
			Mostly, I remember Nana.
			That's beautiful... what is it?
			A family heirloom... it's been in
			the Howard clan for at least
			twenty generations. It's supposed
			to symbolize the "enduring spirit
			of the Howards, wherever they may
			go -- a shining light to guide
			their fortune."
			Nana always kept it lit. I can
			remember sitting in here listening
			to ghost stories with only this
			candle burning...
			You should take it with you...
			I think I will.
			Well... I'm going to head back to
			the ship.
			You don't have to go.
			Something tells me you'd like some
			time alone.
			I'll see you later.
			Thanks.
			Who's there?
			What the hell are you doing?
			Get out of my house.
			I wouldn't get so high and mighty
			with me, Beverly Howard Crusher.
			I've spent more time here in the
			past five years than you have in
			the past twenty.
			How do you know who I am?
			I'm Ned Quint. I took care of
			your grandmother's house and her
			affairs.
			Nana never mentioned you...
			There's a lot of things she didn't
			tell you.
			Now -- let me get rid of that
			candle.
			What do you mean?
			That candle has brought nothing
			but misery and bad luck to your
			grandmother.
			Now listen, Mister Quint -- I
			don't know what your relationship
			was with my grandmother. But this
			is my house now and these are my
			things --
			I'm telling ya -- that candle has
			been a curse on your family for
			generations. And if you had a
			lick of sense, you'd listen to me
			right now and do away with it.
			Now give it to me.
			This is a family heirloom and I
			intend to keep it. I would like
			you to leave my house. Now.
			Howard women... always the same
			stubborn fools...
			I wash my hands of it now. You
			stay in this house and keep that
			damned candle and I won't be
			responsible for what happens.
			The colony's (TECH) systems are
			functioning normally... as are the
			(TECH) systems.
			Can you check the seismic
			stabilizers? We've been having a
			few tremors over the past couple
			of months.
			Certainly.
			You can't imagine what it's like
			trying to enjoy afternoon tea
			while the earth is shaking.
			Governor... did you know you had
			a power fluctuation in your
			weather control system?
			No... our weather control's been
			working perfectly for over twenty-two
			years.
			I can't isolate the exact source,
			but the fluctuation seems to be
			originating from one of the
			substations that regulates
			atmospheric humidity for the
			colony.
			Is this going to be a problem?
			Not yet... but power distribution
			patterns are already off by five
			percent.
			I suggest we analyze the planet's
			weather patterns to see if they
			have been affected.
			I am reading unusually high
			humidity across the entire
			Southern desert region... and
			there is increasing cloud activity
			over the Northern coastal area...
			possibly the formation of a storm
			system.
			Storm? It's the middle of Summer --
			we don't have rain at this time of
			year...
			Data, let's see if we can correct
			this. I'll check out the colony's
			climatic flow array.
			And I will run a diagnostic on the
			thermal regulators.
			Don't worry, Governor. We'll keep
			you dry.
			I certainly hope so. There's a
			caber toss scheduled for tomorrow
			afternoon... and I'd hate to see
			it spoiled by an unexpected
			downpour.
			You wouldn't believe what I've
			been reading about in my
			grandmother's journals...
			You know she had a lover? Can you
			believe it? Nana was a hundred
			years old.
			It would seem the Howard women
			have exceptionally... vigorous
			libidos.
			I certainly hope so. I'd like to
			think that I could find a young,
			handsome man in his thirties when
			I pass the century mark.
			Thirties?
			Yes. According to her journal,
			his name is Ronin... and he's
			thirty-four years-old. She met
			him just after my great-grandmother
			died. And I think I
			saw him at the funeral. He threw
			a camellia onto her grave.
			The strange thing is, Nana never
			mentioned him to me in her
			letters... never once. And they
			apparently spent almost all of
			their time together...
			It's like she led a whole life I
			never knew about.
			Well... it looks like we're going
			to be at Caldos for a few more
			days. This might give you a
			chance to get your grandmother's
			affairs in order.
			Thank you. I will.
			Beverly...
			You dreamt you were in bed with
			someone?
			Not exactly. I was in bed... but
			there wasn't another person in the
			dream... it was more like a
			presence...
			You said you felt a touch...
			A pair of hands. They were moving
			across my skin...
			Like a caress?
			Yes. And I heard a voice... a
			man... he whispered my name...
			It was almost like I knew him...
			or more like he knew me. He knew
			exactly how I liked to be
			touched...
			It was the most... physical dream
			I've ever had. The sensations
			were so real...
			And extremely... arousing.
			Frankly, I'm envious.
			I did fall asleep reading a
			particularly erotic chapter in my
			grandmother's journal. She wrote
			very detailed descriptions about
			her experiences with Ronin.
			That's bound to cause a dream or
			two.
			So... should we start going over
			the personnel reports?
			You know, I think I even felt a
			ring on one of the hands... when
			it touched my shoulder... and my
			neck.
			I wonder if I'll have another
			dream tonight...
			I'd read two chapters.
			You probably want to be alone.
			I'll leave.
			No... it's okay.
			Look, I'm sorry we got off to such
			a bad start yesterday. I've been
			reading my grandmother's
			journals... and I know how much
			you meant to her.
			She was a grand lady. You won't
			see many more like her...
			You have your grandmother's fire,
			that's for sure.
			Ned... you're welcome to stay on
			at the house after I'm gone. I'll
			need someone to take care of it.
			That's kind of you, Lass. But
			I'll never set foot in that house
			again. And I recommend that you
			don't either.
			Why?
			Like I tried to tell your
			grandmother... that house is
			haunted.
			Haunted?
			And don't you smile at me. She
			smiled at me, too. I know you fly
			around the galaxy in a starship
			and all... think you're so much
			smarter than the rest of us...
			Ned, I never said that...
			Oh, but you were thinking it.
			Just an old man with tales of
			ghosts and goblins... But I was
			born in Kilmarnock -- the real
			Kilmarnock on Earth. I've seen
			things there on the moors at night
			that canna be explained by a
			tricorder, or a fancy ship.
			I grew up in that house. I loved
			that house.
			Sure... Felisa did too. And now
			she's dead.
			Are you suggesting my grandmother
			didn't die of natural causes?
			Believe what ya want... just
			don't light that candle.
			Why not?
			It'll bring the ghost... it's his
			home.
			Right now he's out... wanderin'
			across the land... angry 'cause
			he's been driven out...
			That's why he's bringing the
			storms.
			Ned -- the weather control system
			is malfunctioning. The Enterprise
			is trying to fix it...
			Oh, sure... and who do you think
			is causing the malfunction?
			I think your imagination is --
			Think what ya want, see what ya
			want. But just do what I say.
			Don't light the candle. Don't go
			in that house. Or before you know
			it... I'll be burying another
			Howard in this cemetery.
			Captain -- I am detecting
			atmospheric turbulence over the
			colony... and large pockets of
			electrical activity.
			On screen.
			That's one hell of a thunderstorm.
			Bridge to Engineering. Mister
			Data, we're reading an extremely
			large storm system over the Caldos
			Colony. It was my understanding
			that the weather control
			malfunction was not severe.
			It began as a minor power
			fluctuation, sir -- but the effect
			has spread throughout the control
			grid.
			It has caused unusual
			concentrations of cumulonimbus
			activity above the colony.
			Captain, I suggest we set up a
			power transfer between the
			Enterprise and the weather
			substations -- try to give them
			enough power to stabilize the
			storm.
			Make it so.
			In the meantime, Number One --
			contact Governor Maturin. Tell
			him to expect some... rough
			weather.
			Who's there?
			Ned, is that you? Hello... ?
			I know somebody's here... now I
			suggest you --
			Alright... that's it. Whoever you
			are, show yourself right now or
			I'm going to call the Enterprise
			and have ten security guards down
			here in the next thirty seconds.
			Beverly...
			Beverly... I've come back for
			you...
			Who are you?
			Don't you remember? I came to you
			last night... while you were
			asleep...
			No... that was a dream...
			I'm calling the Enterprise.
			Now do you remember me?
			Yes, but... what's happening to
			me... I feel... strange...
			I love you, Beverly... just as I
			loved Felisa before you.
			Are you... Ronin?
			That's right... you saw me at the
			funeral.
			Who... are you?
			I'm a spirit...
			But I don't believe in...
			Ghosts? I don't blame you... I
			didn't either at first. But I was
			born in sixteen-forty-seven... in
			Glasgow on Earth.
			So you're telling me that you're
			an eight hundred year-old ghost...
			That's right. I found a home with
			Jessel Howard... she was a pretty
			lass with a mane of red hair, and
			eyes like diamonds... and I loved
			her very much. And when she died,
			I stayed with her daughter... and
			her daughter... and on down
			through the years, generation
			after generation...
			And now you're here... on
			Caldos... two hundred light years
			away?
			Yes... When your family moved out
			into the galaxy, I moved with
			them.
			I don't believe you...
			I believe you are the most
			beautiful women I have ever
			known...
			Wait -- what's happening...
			We're becoming one, Beverly...
			we're going to be together...
			I don't understand... stop...
			Come in.
			Hi, Bev. I just wanted to see if
			you were going to mok'bara class
			this morning.
			No... I think I'm going to skip it
			today. I'm exhausted.
			Did you have another dream last
			night?
			Not exactly...
			Is anything wrong?
			Not at all. I'm just a little
			tired.
			Beverly... if I didn't know any
			better, I'd say you're seeing
			someone.
			Deanna...
			Oh, now I know you're seeing
			someone.
			I'm not... "seeing" anybody. I
			met someone, that's all...
			Well, you obviously have romantic
			feelings for him...
			Beverly, you should realize by now
			you can't fool me. Who is it?
			Alright... the truth is, I met
			Ronin.
			Ronin? Your grandmother's lover?
			I know, I know... it sounds crazy.
			But he's unlike anyone I've ever
			met before.
			I've never known anyone who's
			so... passionate. It's like he
			brings every part of me alive.
			He's very...
			Sensual?
			Yes. Exactly. I can see why Nana
			fell in love with him...
			You must think this is pretty
			strange...
			I will admit, it's unusual... but
			I'm very happy for you.
			But I do want you to consider
			something. You and Ronin have
			both experienced a tremendous
			loss. Very often a shared
			traumatic experience can create
			the illusion of closeness... and
			romance.
			I appreciate the concern, but I
			think I know what I'm doing.
			Besides, I didn't say I was in
			love with him. I'm just...
			intrigued.
			You know, Captain... I moved to
			this colony because it was a
			recreation of Scotland. But I
			must admit, it's becoming a little
			too realistic.
			What the hell is going on?
			It appears to be a concentrated
			suspension of water vapor,
			approximately one degree Celsius.
			Fog?
			It just sort of... rolled in on
			us, sir.
			There has been a malfunction in
			the ship's environmental controls.
			We've traced the problem to the
			power transfer beam -- we're
			getting some sort of feedback from
			one of the colony's weather
			substations.
			Another power fluctuation?
			Captain -- the temperature in Ten
			Forward has dropped below
			freezing... and Deck Nineteen has
			just lost gravity.
			Mister Data -- disengage the power
			transfer.
			I am unable to terminate the
			connection, sir. A feedback loop
			has formed in the transfer beam.
			I will have to go to the
			substation and attempt to correct
			the problem from there.
			Make it so.
			In the meantime, I think I'll get
			my jacket.
			It appears that the station is
			experiencing a system-wide power
			failure.
			How's that possible? The back-up
			systems should have --
			Data -- I think I just found the
			problem...
			You are dismantling the primary
			power conduit. I must ask you to
			stop.
			No...
			Get away from me!
			He'll kill us all! You don't
			understand --
			He is dead.
			From what I can tell, he was
			trying to shut down the entire
			weather control system...
			He was pulling out the primary
			plasma conduit... that's probably
			what caused the plasma discharge
			that killed him.
			I knew Ned Quint. He was an
			honest man... he mostly kept to
			himself. I can't imagine why he
			would do something like this...
			It'll take some time to get the
			system back on-line... I'd say we
			need another day, at least.
			In the meantime, Governor, you
			should expect the weather problems
			to continue.
			Commander Data -- you'd better
			take a look at this.
			Data, you said you saw a plasma
			discharge coming from the console
			when Quint was killed...
			That is correct.
			Well, that's not what killed him.
			I'm detecting an anomalous energy
			residual throughout his body...
			all the way down to the cellular
			level.
			Whatever it is, it's definitely
			not the result of a plasma
			discharge.
			Anything?
			I cannot identify the energy
			residual. However, it appears to
			have the same anaphasic signature
			as the power fluctuations we
			observed in the weather control
			system.
			Then it's possible that whatever
			caused the weather malfunctions
			also killed Quint...
			It is possible.
			We should scan the colony for any
			energy readings that match this
			anaphasic signature.
			Governor, with your permission,
			I'd like to take the body back to
			the ship to run a few more tests.
			Of course, Doctor.
			Ensign, have Doctor Selar run a
			bio-spectral analysis.
			You're not going to run the tests
			yourself?
			No. There are some things I have
			to attend to...
			Ronin... I have to talk to you...
			are you here?
			I'm here, Beverly... did you miss
			me?
			Yes....
			But... I must talk to you.
			There's been an accident...
			I know. Quint is dead.
			Do you know what happened? What
			was he trying to do?
			Beverly... there's something more
			important we have to talk about...
			Ronin... I've got to know.
			Quint's dead...
			Ronin?
			Yes...
			I need you to help me...
			Help you?
			It's not easy for me to take
			corporeal form... I can't do it
			for long. I want you to light the
			candle...
			Quint said it was your home... is
			that true?
			Yes... if I'm away from it for too
			long, I begin to weaken. That's
			why the women in your family have
			always kept the candle lit.
			The candle is on my ship... I'll
			go get it...
			No... there's no time... I'll go
			with you...
			How... ?
			The power transfer beam... I can
			travel along it.
			After I light the candle, then
			what?
			Then we'll be together... always.
			Computer, secure door.
			I lit the candle... where are you?
			It's all right... we're
			together... we're going to be
			one... I'll become part of you,
			Beverly. Would you like that?
			Yes... more than anything.
			As it was with your grandmother...
			and your great-grandmother... and
			all of the Howard women before
			them... I'll take care of you.
			And you'll feel love as you've
			never felt it before...
			Beverly... what the hell is this?
			I thought it was pretty self-explanatory.
			I'm leaving
			Starfleet.
			Energize.
			Belay that order.
			Beverly, you can't just... resign.
			I can -- and I have. I've decided
			to stay on Caldos and become a
			healer, like my grandmother. It's
			a proud Howard tradition, and I've
			decided to uphold it.
			Energize.
			I've resigned my commission. Now
			unless you plan on kidnapping
			me...
			Beverly was attracted to Ronin in
			a very... intense and intimate
			way. I warned her that they had
			both experienced a recent loss...
			but she seemed very defensive
			about it... so I left her alone.
			I could sense she was holding
			something back... she wasn't
			telling me the whole truth...
			Do you think this Ronin may be
			exerting some sort of influence on
			her... that she may be staying
			because of him?
			It's possible. She may really
			believe she's in love...
			It's a rash decision... ill-considered...
			not like Beverly at
			all.
			I agree. But she does have the
			right to make that choice, even if
			we feel it's a bad one.
			Come.
			Captain, Geordi and I have
			detected an energy residual with
			the same anaphasic signature as
			the one we found in Ned Quint's
			body.
			Where?
			Approximately seventeen kilometers
			from the center of the colony.
			It is coming from the cemetery,
			sir.
			I want you to go down to the
			cemetery... see if you can
			pinpoint the source.
			Aye sir.
			In the meantime, I would very much
			like to meet this... Ronin.
			The energy readings are coming
			from this area, but I can't get an
			exact location. I'll try to
			narrow the scan field...
			The energy readings appear to be
			originating approximately eight
			meters below the surface.
			I believe they are concentrated
			within this burial site.
			I'm so glad you're here... right
			now I can't imagine what life was
			like before I met you.
			And it will only get better.
			Ronin... I had no idea I could
			feel this way...
			We're nearly merged now... as two
			candles join to form a single
			light... so we will flourish as
			one...
			I love you, Beverly.
			I love you...
			Beverly...
			Jean-Luc...
			I'm sorry for startling you. I
			knocked, but there was no answer.
			What do you want?
			I hoped to meet your new friend...
			Ronin.
			He's... not here.
			Oh. Well, if you don't mind I'll
			wait. I'm anxious to meet this
			remarkable young man who swept
			away not only one, but two of the
			Howard women.
			Jealousy doesn't become you, Jean-Luc.
			Beverly... did you change the
			color of your eyes?
			Yes... I just got tired of the old
			color. Don't you think this suits
			me?
			I think I liked your eyes the way
			they were before...
			I think I liked you the way you
			were before, Beverly.
			Well, this is the way I am now.
			This is my life. I've made my
			decision and I'm not going to
			change my mind, so please leave me
			alone.
			No... there's something's wrong
			here. This is about more than
			just an obsessive love affair
			that's gotten out of hand...
			Why is it that no one has seen
			this Ronin except you?
			Alright, Captain. Here I am.
			And I believe Beverly asked you to
			leave.
			So, you're Ronin... it's a
			pleasure to meet you. Where are
			you from?
			Earth. Scotland.
			How long have you been here on
			Caldos?
			All that matters is that I'm here
			now. And that Beverly and I plan
			to be together for the rest our
			lives.
			That's a very... romantic notion.
			Especially for two people who have
			just met. Don't you think perhaps
			you're rushing into things a bit?
			I think you're a jealous man who
			can't bear the thought of losing
			a beautiful woman like Beverly.
			Data to Picard.
			Go ahead.
			Captain, we have located the
			source of the energy residual. It
			appears to be concentrated within
			Felisa Howard's coffin.
			Captain, we'd like permission to
			exhume the body.
			You can't do that. Leave her
			alone...
			Why? What are you afraid of?
			I'm not afraid of anything. But
			I won't let you desecrate her
			grave.
			Mister Data, contact Governor
			Maturin and ask for permission to
			exhume the body. Picard out.
			I won't stand for this... I'll go
			to the governor myself.
			Go ahead. But I'll be surprised
			if the governor knows who you are.
			He'll probably have the same
			questions I do. How did you come
			to Caldos? What ship did you
			arrive on?
			Jean-Luc, leave him alone --
			Answer the question, Ronin. What
			ship? I'd like to look at the
			passenger list.
			Where have you been living here on
			Caldos? What's your position
			here? Who are your neighbors?
			Come on, Beverly -- we have to get
			out of here.
			Jean-Luc...
			Beverly, we must stop the others.
			They cannot exhume the body.
			We can't leave him... he'll die.
			You must come. I am your love.
			I'm the one who will take care of
			you.
			No... no, I can't just let him
			die...
			Beverly... come with me.
			No... no!
			I'm going to stop them.
			I'm alright...
			Beverly... you must go after
			him... go to the cemetery...
			La Forge to Enterprise -- we're
			ready down here.
			I am reading definite signs of
			anaphasic energy in her body -- it
			appears to extend to the cellular
			level.
			How's that possible? She wasn't
			anywhere near the weather station
			when Quint was killed... she died
			of natural causes...
			I suggest we run a deep tissue
			scan to look for --
			Stop -- NO!
			Ronin -- stop this... please...
			Beverly, it's all right... have
			trust in me..
			You're not Nana... Nana's dead.
			Leave her alone.
			Beverly, these men were trying to
			stop us from being together. Once
			they're gone, everything will be
			all right.
			No... I won't let you hurt my
			friends.
			No, it won't. I scanned myself
			with the tricorder. You've been
			infusing me with the same
			anaphasic energy that killed
			Quint...
			He was trying to destroy me... I
			had to defend myself...
			But I would never hurt you,
			Beverly. I'm here to protect
			you...
			No, you're not. There's no such
			thing as a ghost... you're some
			sort of... anaphasic lifeform...
			Anaphasic energy is extremely
			unstable... without an organic
			host to maintain your molecular
			cohesion, you'd die... isn't that
			right?
			Beverly...
			I scanned the candle, too... the
			flame is plasma-based... you were
			using it as a temporary receptacle
			for yourself... until you could
			get to me... so you could "merge"
			with me...
			You've been using me... Nana... my
			whole family... for centuries...
			And I loved all of them... and
			they loved me.
			Give me the candle, Beverly.
			No...
			Put it down -- or I'll kill him.
			Very good... now set it down...
			then walk way.
			NO!
			Crusher to Riker. Wil -- I want
			you to shut down all plasma
			conduits in the weather control
			system. I'll explain later.
			Understood.
			You've got nowhere left to go...
			Yes, I do...
			Keep away from me...
			Somehow he realized that one of my
			ancestors had a biochemistry that
			was compatible with his energy
			matrix...
			I imagine he took human form and
			seduced her the same way he did
			me. He had some sort of
			hypnotic... almost telepathic
			control.
			It's strange... I was about to be
			initiated into a very unusual
			relationship... I guess you could
			call it a family tradition. And
			there's a part of me that's a
			little sad...
			How so?
			I re-read the entries in my
			grandmother's journals. Whatever
			else he might have done... he made
			her very happy.
