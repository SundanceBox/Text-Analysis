			Come in!
			Geordi... ?
			I'm in here...
			I've got her now, Data... she's
			trapped.
			Who?
			Your demented cat.
			I do not understand. Why is Spot
			under the bed?
			Probably because she knows I'll
			kill her if I get my hands on her.
			Has Spot been misbehaving?
			That's putting it mildly. So far
			she's broken a vase and a teapot,
			destroyed my couch by using it as
			a scratching post, and coughed up
			hairballs on my carpet.
			These incidents are common to cat
			owners. When you borrowed Spot,
			you said you wanted to experience
			the full range of feline behavior
			before getting a cat yourself.
			Yeah, well, I don't think I'm
			ready for one. You can take her
			back, with my blessings.
			Well? Go ahead -- call her.
			Spot does not respond to verbal
			commands.
			She won't come when you call her?
			No.
			Data, have you ever considered
			training her?
			I have never found it to be
			necessary.
			Necessary? That cat is out of
			control.
			Half the time I wasn't sure if she
			was going to lick me or scratch my
			face off.
			I have never experienced that kind
			of behavior from Spot.
			Although she does have the
			unfortunate habit of jumping onto
			my computer console when I am
			working.
			There, see? She needs training.
			Riker to senior staff. Please
			report to the observation lounge.
			Mission briefing in ten minutes.
			Okay, we have to get her out from
			under there. I'll scare her --
			you grab her when she comes out.
			I do not think it would be wise to
			startle her --
			Now!
			Uh-oh...
			Training.
			Definitely.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47310.2.
			We are investigating the
			disappearance of the Medical
			Transport Fleming somewhere in the
			Hekaras Corridor. Our search is
			complicated by the unique
			properties of this particular
			region of space.
			The Fleming's last contact with
			Starfleet was four days ago. They
			didn't report anything out of the
			ordinary when they entered the
			Corridor...
			The unusually intense tetryon
			fields in this sector pose a
			severe navigational hazard to warpdriven
			vessels...
			The Hekaras Corridor is the only
			route through the area which is
			free of tetryon fields. Ships
			travelling at warp must use the
			Corridor to ensure safe passage
			through the region.
			How long will it take to complete
			a level-one search?
			At least two days, sir. The
			Corridor is over twelve lightyears
			long, and the surrounding
			tetryon interference will limit
			our sensor range.
			Could we send out reconnaissance
			probes to supplement the sensors?
			They won't be very effective. The
			interference will make it
			difficult to maintain contact with
			the probes; the best we can do is
			to try increasing the sensor
			efficiency.
			We're installing multi-phase
			buffers on all the sensor modules.
			It should help a little.
			Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't
			it? Maybe they've had contact
			with the Fleming.
			They haven't. I've already spoken
			with the Hekaran government.
			According to them, only one ship
			has passed through their system in
			the last week... and that was a
			Ferengi trader.
			The Fleming was carrying a supply
			of bio-mimetic gel... it's rare
			and quite valuable. Do you think
			it's possible the Ferengi could
			have hijacked it?
			I wouldn't put it past them.
			We should be prepared for that
			contingency.
			Agreed.
			All right then. Mister Worf,
			initiate your search pattern.
			Let's head in.
			Geordi, we have experienced a
			slight drop in sensor efficiency.
			Commander Riker would like us to
			examine the phase buffers.
			No problem, Data... I'll be with
			you in a minute...
			All right, Hansen, transfer EPS
			conduit thirteen through the
			stabilizer matrix.
			Aye, sir.
			Geordi, is there a problem with
			the engines?
			No, not really...
			Then why are you stabilizing the
			EPS conduit?
			I'm just trying to get a slightly
			higher power conversion level...
			That would not affect the engines
			in any way.
			I know. That's not the point.
			Then... what is "the point?"
			I just... want the best conversion
			level I can get.
			Why?
			It's the Intrepid.
			Their Chief Engineer is Commander
			Donald Kaplan. We went through
			the Academy together. And... I
			kind of like to make sure our
			power conversion level is... a
			little higher than theirs.
			I understand. You are in
			competition with Mister Kaplan.
			No, it's not really a
			competition...
			This is the flagship. It just
			seems to me -- we should be better
			than the rest.
			That does sound like a competitive
			position.
			It's more a matter of personal
			pride. I mean... these are my
			engines.
			But you are trying to outperform
			the Intrepid.
			Well... yeah.
			Computer. How much have the
			conversion levels increased?
			Levels are unchanged.
			All right, we'll deal with of this
			later...
			Let's take a look at those
			sensors.
			Okay -- how's that?
			The phase buffer is functioning
			within normal parameters. Sensor
			efficiency has increased six-point-seven
			percent.
			Only six-point-seven? One of the
			stages must still be out of
			alignment...
			Let's check out junction A-nine.
			Geordi, I have taken your
			suggestion regarding Spot.
			What suggestion?
			I have begun to train her. I am
			currently testing several
			techniques.
			Really...
			I began with simple conditioned
			response exercises and followed
			with various environmental
			enhancements. Next I intend to
			explore bio-conditioning devices.
			Devices?
			Such as sensor nets for behavior
			modification... or bio-feedback
			motivators...
			Unfortunately, I have been largely
			unsuccessful...
			How about a phaser? A low stun
			setting at the right moment might
			do the trick...
			Geordi. I will not stun my cat.
			I was just kidding...
			This isn't it, either.
			There is clearly a misalignment
			somewhere in this system.
			That's for sure...
			There's one more possibility...
			let's take a look at junction C-twelve...
			I am somewhat concerned that my
			training efforts will ultimately
			fail...
			Well, maybe you're just going
			about it the wrong way.
			I have consulted numerous animal
			behavior manuals; several of them
			claim that cats are inherently
			untrainable.
			I don't believe that. My sister
			didn't know a thing about animals
			and she was able to train her cat.
			How complicated could it be?
			What did she train her cat to do?
			Well... her cat would jump into
			her arms on command.
			That is interesting. Perhaps I
			could modify your sister's
			technique to keep Spot off my
			console. Do you know how she was
			able to train her cat?
			Well, as I recall, she had to walk
			around for about two months with
			a piece of tuna in her blouse...
			I was right... this buffer is out
			of alignment...
			All right... how's that?
			The phase alignment is
			stabilizing...
			However, sensor efficiency has
			only increased an additional one-point-three
			percent.
			Well, that's not much, but every
			little bit helps.
			Riker to Data.
			Data here.
			We're picking up a ship ahead on
			long range sensors. If you and
			Geordi are through down there,
			we'd like to have you on the
			Bridge.
			We've squeezed as much out of
			these systems as we're going to
			get.
			Acknowledged, sir. We are on our
			way.
			We are within visual range, sir.
			On screen.
			This is the same Ferengi ship that
			entered the Corridor a week ago.
			Captain, there are no emissions
			from their plasma vents. Their
			warp drive must be completely
			inactive.
			That is correct, sir. Their
			impulse systems appear to be down
			as well... power generation is at
			extremely low levels.
			What about life signs?
			Life support is also functioning,
			at low levels. There are
			approximately four-hundred fifty
			Ferengi on board. That is a
			standard complement for a vessel
			of this class.
			Mister Worf, open a hailing
			frequency.
			No response on any channel, sir.
			I'm not reading any subspace
			emissions from their ship at all,
			sir. It looks like every one of
			their field coils has been
			overloaded.
			That would explain why they didn't
			respond to our hails...
			It would also explain the failure
			of their warp drive.
			Sir, the Feregni sensors are still
			functioning. I could modify one
			of our deflector emitters to
			transmit old-style delta waves...
			if I modulate that with a com
			signal, the Ferengi should be able
			to pick it up.
			Make it so.
			Well, if they did hijack the
			Fleming, they certainly didn't get
			very far with the cargo.
			Mister Worf, have tractor beams
			standing by... we may have to take
			them under tow...
			Helm, bring us within tractor
			range...
			Captain, I am picking up power
			emissions from the Ferengi ship...
			They are locking weapons!
			Raise shields --
			Ready phasers. Prepare to return
			fire.
			Target their weapons array only.
			Phasers locked.
			Fire.
			Direct hit.
			Their weapon systems are down.
			Damage report.
			We sustained minimal damage on
			decks five and seven, sir.
			Sir, the Ferengi ship's power has
			stabilized... they appear to have
			impulse capability.
			They were just playing dead...
			conserving power until we got in
			close enough.
			But why attack us in the first
			place?
			Somehow I don't think they're
			going to let us beam over and ask
			them...
			Mister La Forge, how are you
			coming with that com link?
			Almost ready, sir...
			We can give it a try.
			Open a channel.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the Enterprise. Please explain
			your attack on my ship.
			Our attack? We were defending
			ourselves. Do you deny that you
			are responsible for disabling my
			vessel?
			Your ship was adrift and your
			communications inoperative. We
			were attempting to ascertain your
			status.
			You were attempting to move in for
			the kill.
			Do not toy with me, Picard... we
			are obviously at your mercy. But
			know this: when the Ferengi
			Council learns of your actions,
			they will consider this an act of
			war.
			Daimon, there has clearly been a
			misunderstanding here. I believe
			it would be in everyone's best
			interests if you came aboard and
			we discussed the situation.
			I see no reason to trust you,
			hewman.
			Then I suppose we'll be on our
			way...
			If you wish, I'll relay your
			position to your government... in
			case you're unable to complete
			repairs... and remain stranded
			here.
			Perhaps it would be better to
			discuss the situation...
			We detected what appeared to be a
			Federation signal buoy. When we
			approached it, it emitted a
			massive verteron pulse... our warp
			drive, our sensors, our
			communications systems were all
			disabled.
			We assumed we were the victims of
			a new Federation weapon.
			Daimon Prak. The Federation
			established this Corridor to
			ensure a safe route through the
			sector. We have nothing to gain
			from mining it.
			Whatever happened to your ship may
			not be an isolated incident. A
			Federation Medical transport was
			recently lost in the Corridor.
			We passed a Federation ship
			several days ago. It did not
			appear to be in any distress.
			Can you give us an idea of their
			heading?
			It's possible that information was
			recorded in our sensor logs,
			Commander.
			Unfortunately, my entire crew is
			occupied with our repairs. I
			don't know if there will be time
			to search our records.
			Perhaps if we assigned an
			engineering team to assist with
			the repair efforts... would that
			give you time to retrieve your
			logs?
			I believe it would, Captain.
			Spot -- down.
			Spot -- down.
			Spot -- down.
			This is up. Up is no.
			This is down.
			Down is good.
			Come in.
			Data. I had another idea that
			might help boost our power
			conversion levels. Could you give
			me a hand?
			I would be happy to.
			Don't tell me you're training her
			to use the console.
			As part of her training program,
			I am teaching Spot to jump down
			from the desk on my command.
			How's it going?
			I have not been entirely
			successful...
			Feline supplement two-hundred
			twenty-one.
			That cat has definitely got a mind
			of her own, Data. Maybe she's
			just not trainable.
			I suppose I must accept that
			possibility. It may be that Spot
			lacks the intelligence necessary
			to learn the appropriate responses
			to my commands.
			Maybe.
			But I think your training is
			coming along quite nicely.
			Come on, Data, let's go.
			Okay, Data, keep the EPS flow
			constant while I re-modulate the
			power taps.
			This procedure could only boost
			the conversion level by -- point-eight
			percent.
			That's all right... it might be
			enough.
			Enough?
			Commander Kaplan just sent me this
			on subspace.
			"La Forge. I've got Intrepid's
			power conversion level up to
			ninety-seven-point-one percent.
			Maybe you should try cleaning your
			plasma grid once in a while."
			Can you believe the nerve of this
			guy... ?
			We perform maintenance on the
			plasma grid at regular intervals.
			Of course we do -- he's just
			trying to get me angry.
			That should do it...
			Computer, what is the current
			power conversion level?
			Power conversion level is ninety-seven-point-two
			percent.
			Too bad, Mister Kaplan...
			Captain's Log, Stardate, 47311.4.
			Based on the Ferengi sensor logs,
			we have traced the Fleming's most
			likely course. It now appears
			that the vessel may have come to
			an unfortunate end.
			What's the origin of this debris
			field?
			Unknown, sir. It does not appear
			on any Federation charts of the
			Corridor.
			Could it be what's left of the
			Fleming?
			It is a possibility. The debris
			consists primarily of duranium and
			poly-composite fragments which
			suggests it could be from a ship.
			Furthermore, the field contains
			sufficient mass to account for the
			Fleming.
			All right... let's take a closer
			look. Perhaps we can find
			something to give us a positive
			identification.
			Helm, plot a course through the
			debris field. Ahead slow.
			Captain, I am picking up a small,
			metallic object, approximately
			three-point-five meters in
			diameter...
			It could be a ship's log
			recorder... or a probe casing.
			I do not believe so... it is
			emitting an unusual signal ...
			Sir, it is beginning to generate
			a verteron field.
			Shields up! Full reverse, now!
			Damage report.
			Warp engines are off-line...
			shields are down... all subspace
			systems are inoperative...
			Just like the Ferengi ship.
			Captain, there is an unidentified
			vessel heading toward us... two
			life forms aboard...
			On screen.
			They are initiating their
			Transporter systems...
			Can you get any power to the
			shields?
			No sir.
			All decks... security alert!
			We are being boarded...
			La Forge to Bridge... we've got
			intruders in Main Engineering...
			We need a security team down
			here...
			It's on the way...
			What do you want?
			We're trying to make you listen...
			You are killing us.
			You've made a very serious
			accusation. I want you to explain
			it.
			Captain, according to our
			research, warp fields are causing
			a dangerous reaction in this
			region of space.
			Our planet is already being
			affected. We have measured large
			gravitational shifts throughout
			our system.
			If something isn't done, our
			planet will become uninhabitable.
			Captain, I've heard this theory
			before. Their research was
			evaluated by the Federation
			Science Council a few years ago.
			Their claims just didn't hold up.
			That research was only
			preliminary. Our original
			analysis was incomplete...
			Doctor, if you wanted us to review
			your research, you could have
			placed a request through the
			Science Council.
			Their resources are limited. It
			would have taken over a year
			before they dispatched a science
			ship to come and evaluate our
			work.
			We were not willing to wait any
			longer.
			We knew that if we disabled enough
			ships, Starfleet would come. Then
			at least we would be able to
			present our case...
			That's how you rationalize these
			attacks?
			Neither you nor the Ferengi
			suffered any casualties,
			Commander. The actual damage to
			your vessels was negligible.
			We dispersed verteron probes in
			the Corridor only to disable warpdriven
			ships... nothing more.
			You can call it whatever you like.
			The fact remains that you
			deliberately disguised your
			probes. You made them look like
			signal markers... You hid them in
			debris fields... You mined the
			Corridor.
			Mister La Forge, how long do you
			estimate it will take to restore
			the engines?
			Their verteron pulse overloaded
			our field coils, sir... it'll take
			at least thirty-six hours to get
			underway.
			I know precisely how our pulse
			affected your field coils. With
			my help, your ship could be
			operational in ten hours...
			Provided you agree to review our
			research.
			Because of the seriousness of your
			claims, I'm willing to listen to
			your case. But make no mistake.
			Our priority here is the recovery
			of the Fleming.
			I expect you to help us restore
			our systems and deactivate all
			your remaining probes in the
			Corridor...
			If you do not, I will put you both
			in the brig and take you to the
			nearest Starbase where you'll face
			charges for what you've done.
			My sister and I have no wish to
			impede your rescue efforts --
			Rabal, don't. The probes are the
			only leverage we have. If we --
			Serova.
			We will do as you ask, Captain,
			but please... re-examine our data.
			We will, Doctor. Part of our job
			is to maintain an open mind...
			even under these circumstances.
			Mister La Forge, take them to
			Engineering and get the core back
			on-line.
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Data, begin a review of
			their research. I'd like your
			report as soon as possible.
			There... shields have been
			restored. You'll be able to reengage
			your engines in...
			approximately eight hours.
			You know, even after we get the
			engines on-line, it's going to
			take a week to recalibrate them
			properly...
			I'm sorry you've been
			inconvenienced.
			But that's all it is -- an
			inconvenience. Our concerns are
			far more important than the
			condition of your engines.
			What if the Fleming had been
			transporting perishable
			supplies... or was on an emergency
			mission? Your little plan might
			have cost a lot of lives.
			That didn't happen, Commander.
			And saving lives is precisely what
			we're trying to do.
			Well, you have an interesting way
			of going about it.
			There's no point talking to you.
			You've already decided not to
			listen.
			Commander... I know my sister can
			be somewhat -- aggravating...
			I'd have to agree with that...
			But please try to understand...
			she believes profoundly in this
			cause. She has sworn to dedicate
			her life to exposing the dangers
			of warp drive.
			Warp drive has been around for
			three centuries. It's a proven
			technology...
			You sound like I did... about four
			years ago...
			You mean you didn't believe her,
			either?
			No. What I didn't realize... was
			how brilliant my sister is. It
			took two years of study for me
			even to grasp the principles
			behind her theoretical models...
			they're that sophisticated.
			Well, our Commander Data is no
			slouch. If there's anything
			there, he'll find it.
			I hope so.
			Because once we persuade Starfleet
			to stop warp travel through the
			Corridor... we will have to
			convince our own people to give up
			warp drive completely.
			Hekaras Two is the only inhabited
			world in this region. Without
			warp drive, you'd be completely
			isolated from the rest of the
			Federation. Are you really
			willing to take that step?
			Yes. And if you were in my
			position, I hope you'd be willing
			to do the same.
			According to Serova and Rabal's
			theory, there are regions of
			potential subspace instability
			within the Corridor...
			They believe that if these regions
			continue to be exposed to warp
			field energy, they will rupture --
			subspace will extrude into normal
			space, forming a rift.
			I see. It's like pacing up and
			down on a carpet... eventually,
			you wear a hole in it.
			The analogy is essentially
			correct.
			Can their theory be proven?
			At this time, there is
			insufficient evidence to do so...
			In order to determine whether or
			not a rift would form, we would
			have to expose a region of the
			Corridor to warp field energy
			approximately one-million times
			greater than that normally
			generated by a starship.
			Commander, we believe the warp
			field effect is cumulative. Each
			starship that passes through the
			Corridor at warp brings us one
			step closer to forming a rift.
			I agree that is a possibility.
			Captain, I suggest we ask the
			Federation Science Council to send
			a research vessel to this area.
			A more detailed investigation
			would resolve many of our
			questions.
			That's your response? More
			research? More delays? I suppose
			I shouldn't have expected anything
			different.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			Sir, we've located the Fleming on
			long-range sensors, approximately
			zero-point-three light years away.
			What's their condition?
			The vessel appears to be intact.
			They have shields, but it looks
			like their subspace systems are
			out.
			All right. We'll get underway as
			soon as the engines are back on-line.
			Aye, sir.
			I'd like you all to put together
			a research proposal for the
			Science Council. I'll give it my
			full recommendation.
			Yes, sir.
			Captain, I appreciate the
			opportunity you're giving us.
			It's a beginning that we --
			Not "we". You can do whatever you
			want, Rabal. I'll have no part of
			this. It's just another delay.
			The engines are back on-line, sir.
			All systems are ready.
			Very good.
			Helm, lay in a course for the
			Fleming.
			Aye, sir.
			It looks like they're in pretty
			good condition. According to our
			sensors, they've got their shields
			back up to full strength.
			Captain, the Hekaran ship is
			moving off....
			There is one life form on board.
			It is Serova.
			What's going on, Doctor?
			I don't know...
			May I speak to her, Captain?
			Mister Worf, open a channel.
			Serova, what are you trying to do?
			They wanted proof. I'm going to
			give it to them.
			I'm sorry...
			Captain, the Hekaran ship's
			engines are beginning to
			overload...
			I believe Serova is attempting to
			create a warp core breach...
			No...
			Shields at maximum... Full
			reverse...
			Report!
			We have cleared the shock wave,
			sir... but tetryon flux in the
			area is increasing rapidly...
			It's incredible...
			Mister Data, what's your analysis?
			The effect is approximately zero-point-one
			light years in diameter,
			and is emitting extremely high
			levels of tetryon radiation...
			It appears to be what Rabal and
			Serova predicted, sir -- a
			subspace rift.
			She was right...
			Can you get a fix on the Fleming?
			Is it still in one piece?
			Scanning...
			The Fleming is near its previous
			coordinates... it appears to be
			intact.... but it is now within
			the rift.
			Doctor, is it possible for a ship
			to survive in there?
			Doctor...
			I'm sorry about your loss... but
			we need your help now.
			Of course, Captain...
			Does the rift pose any danger to
			the Fleming?
			I... I don't know...
			What was that?
			Some kind of high energy
			distortion wave... it looks like
			they're being generated from
			within the rift.
			As long as we maintain our current
			position, our shields should
			provide sufficient protection.
			What about the Fleming? How long
			can they survive in there?
			The waves are even more intense
			within the rift. I estimate their
			shields will fail within twelve
			hours.
			Can we risk going in there to get
			them out?
			Not at warp, sir.
			According to these readings, the
			rift is in a state of accelerating
			instability -- which would make it
			extremely sensitive to warp field
			energy. If we go in at warp, we
			might make it expand even further.
			I don't think we have a choice.
			It would take weeks to reach them
			at impulse.
			Then I want some better options.
			Data, Geordi... take Doctor Rabal
			and begin an analysis of the rift.
			We need a way to get the Fleming
			out of there.
			Science Officer's log, Stardate
			47312.1. Our new sensor readings
			have greatly improved our
			understanding of the rift.
			However, we have been unable to
			find any way to counteract it.
			Everything here supports Serova's
			theories... I don't see any way to
			close the rift or even reduce its
			size.
			Doctor, is it possible there are
			areas inside the rift which are
			stable... where we could safely
			use our warp engines?
			Perhaps...
			Computer, scan the rift for
			regions of low instability...
			There's no area stable enough to
			withstand a warp pulse...
			There's something strange here...
			Computer. Display grid delta-seventeen...
			enhance and magnify.
			What do you make of that?
			It's a subspace instability --
			outside the rift.
			That should not be possible.
			Commander, I'm going to begin a
			field-enhanced scan of this
			sector. I'd like to take a closer
			look at this.
			In the meantime, we'll have to
			tell the Captain that we don't
			know how to get to the Fleming.
			I am not certain that is true.
			I may have an idea.
			I suggest we coast into the rift.
			Coast?
			We can initiate a brief, high-intensity
			warp pulse from our
			current position. We should be
			able to attain sufficient velocity
			to enter the rift, beam the crew
			off the Fleming and exit --
			without using our warp engines.
			All right. Let's say we initiate
			a full power warp pulse... how
			much time will we have before we
			drop out of warp?
			If we field-saturate the nacelles,
			we should be able to sustain warp
			speed for approximately two
			minutes.
			That's not much time... and it
			could get pretty rough in there.
			Our timing will be critical.
			Mister Data, begin your
			calculations. We'll go in as soon
			as you're ready.
			Aye, sir.
			I believe the maximum saturation
			level should be eighteen-point-three
			percent.
			All right...
			With these parameters, we should
			be able to maintain warp speed
			for... two minutes and eight
			seconds.
			I don't think we can get any more
			than that.
			I agree. But based on the size of
			the rift, it should give us
			sufficient time to complete our
			rescue.
			Computer. Begin nacelle field
			saturation.
			How did we miss it?
			What do you mean?
			How did we miss the connection --
			between warp drive and the
			formation of the rift?
			Between the two of us we've logged
			thousands of hours on these
			engines. We're supposed to be
			warp field experts. But this time
			we certainly were wrong.
			Technically, Geordi, we were not
			wrong. Serova's theories rested
			on assumptions which were
			unprovable.
			Seems to me she managed to prove
			them pretty conclusively...
			But only by using methods which a
			reputable scientist would never
			employ.
			Yeah... she was willing to die to
			make her point.
			We should have listened to her
			more closely.
			We reviewed Serova's research to
			the best of our ability, and we
			were prepared to continue studying
			the problem. But that was not
			satisfactory.
			I can remember times when I've
			been a little stubborn... trying
			to get people to believe me when
			I didn't have enough proof...
			I do not believe that you would
			have resorted to such extremes.
			But she had to... to make us
			listen. Why? Why was I so
			resistant?
			Perhaps because the aggressive
			methods she chose created an
			adversarial situation.
			Or maybe I was taking the whole
			thing personally.
			I do not understand...
			Maybe it was all a little
			threatening to me... the thought
			that warp engines might be doing
			some kind of damage.
			I've always looked at this warp
			core as something... beautiful...
			It never occurred to me that it
			might be -- destructive.
			It's going to take another half
			hour for the nacelles to saturate.
			Would you call me when they're
			ready?
			There's someone I should talk to.
			Commander.
			May I join you?
			I wanted to say... I'm sorry about
			your sister.
			Thank you.
			I'm trying to tell myself that she
			died for what she believed in...
			but somehow that's not much
			comfort.
			I wish things could've happened
			differently. I should have taken
			a closer look at your research...
			it's possible there was something
			I missed...
			No. You didn't miss anything.
			The problem was time. It would've
			taken time to do the proper
			research... and Serova wasn't
			willing to wait.
			I guess the question now is...
			where do we go from here?
			I don't think we can look at space
			travel the same way anymore...
			we're going to have to change.
			I've been in Starfleet for a long
			time. We depend on warp drive...
			I don't know how easy it'll be to
			change.
			It won't be easy at all.
			Captain, warp pulse calculations
			are complete. We will be firing
			the engines at maximum intensity
			for six-point-three seconds before
			disengaging.
			Damage control parties are
			standing-by on all decks.
			Our course to the Fleming is
			plotted and laid in, sir.
			Mister La Forge... whenever you're
			ready...
			Aye-aye, sir.
			Initiating warp pulse... now.
			Engines disengaged...
			We are entering the rift...
			Hull stress is increasing...
			eighteen percent of maximum
			tolerance and rising...
			How long until we reach the
			Fleming?
			One minute, twenty-two seconds...
			All transporter rooms are standing
			by.
			Captain, I am picking up power
			emissions from the Fleming... they
			may be attempting to initiate
			their warp drive.
			They must have been able to repair
			their engines...
			Captain, if they activate their
			engines --
			I know, Data.
			Can we establish communications?
			No, sir... subspace interference
			is too high...
			How long until we reach
			transporter range?
			Fifty-three seconds...
			I don't think we're going to make
			it...
			Sir, they are activating their
			warp drive...
			Report!
			Damage on decks six and
			fourteen... our structural
			integrity field is holding.
			What about the Fleming?
			They are badly damaged, sir...
			their life support systems are
			failing.
			All transporter rooms, prepare for
			emergency evacuation procedures...
			Captain, when the Fleming
			activated its warp drive, the rift
			expanded by two-point-three
			percent...
			We no longer have sufficient
			momentum to escape.
			Captain, distortion wave intensity
			has increased by a factor of ten.
			We are within transporter range of
			the Fleming, sir. Commencing
			evacuation procedures...
			Distortion waves are now occurring
			every fifty-nine seconds... Hull
			stress is nearing maximum
			tolerance...
			Data, what if we forced an EPS
			discharge through the impulse
			reactor... would that be enough
			to blast us out of here?
			I do not believe so, sir... and
			the resulting explosion would most
			likely destroy the saucer section
			in the process...
			Captain...
			We might be able to get out of
			here without using the warp
			engines.
			How, Geordi?
			When's the last time you went
			surfing, Commander?
			A couple of months ago, on Risa...
			I nearly killed myself on the
			break at Kattala beach.
			Feel like catching another wave?
			A distortion wave...
			Exactly, sir. If can phase-match
			our deflector shield to the EM
			variants of the distortion wave,
			when the next one hits, we'll be
			pulled along with it...
			We could ride it out of the rift
			and break away once we're clear.
			Assuming we survive the ride.
			Is everyone off the Fleming?
			The last of the crew has been
			beamed aboard, sir.
			All right, Mister La Forge. Get
			us out of here.
			Yes, sir... I'm phase matching the
			deflector shield now...
			The next distortion wave will
			impact in fourteen seconds...
			Matching phases...
			Prepare to engage shield emitters
			on my mark...
			Ten seconds...
			Ready...
			Engage shield emitters... full
			power...
			Distortion wave impact... now.
			We were unable to maintain contact
			with the distortion wave, sir...
			we are still within the rift.
			What went wrong, Mister La Forge?
			The speed differential between us
			and the wave was too high, sir...
			the shock of the impact threw us
			off.
			Another distortion wave is
			approaching... impact in twenty-six
			seconds.
			Our hull stress is already
			critical... we can't handle many
			more jolts like that one...
			Captain, I suggest we take the
			ship to full impulse. If we can
			attain sufficient speed, it will
			lessen the shock when the wave
			hits.
			Helm, full impulse. Head us out
			of the rift.
			Shield emitters, stand-by.
			We're ready, sir.
			Distortion wave impact in five
			seconds...
			Engage emitters... now.
			We are in the distortion wave...
			hull stresses exceeding
			tolerance...
			Structural integrity fields
			failing on decks ten through
			sixteen..
			We are within the distortion
			wave... hull stresses exceeding
			tolerance...
			Structural integrity fields
			failing on decks ten through
			sixteen... switching to
			backups...
			Captain, we're separating from the
			distortion wave... I'm attempting
			to compensate...
			How much longer until we clear the
			rift?
			Approximately twelve seconds...
			Hull stress is now one-hundred
			twenty percent above maximum...
			Structural breach is imminent...
			We have cleared the rift. Hull
			stresses have returned to normal.
			Cancel red alert.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47314.5.
			We have been continuing our
			research, while the Federation
			Council studies our reports on the
			subspace rift.
			It now appears certain that what
			we've seen here will have
			repercussions for many years to
			come.
			Our scans have shown a lot of
			subspace instabilities all through
			the sector. If they're exposed to
			enough warp energy, they might
			eventually create other rifts.
			Based on current warp drive
			patterns in the sector, we've
			projected where subspace rifts
			will be most likely to form in the
			next forty years.
			This is the way things are now...
			This is how they'll look in ten
			years...
			Thank you, gentlemen.
			We've received new directives from
			the Federation Council on this
			matter...
			Until we can find a way to
			counteract the warp field effect,
			the Council feels our best course
			is to slow the damage as much as
			possible...
			Therefore, areas of space found
			susceptible to warp fields will be
			restricted to essential travel
			only...
			And effective immediately, all
			Federation vessels will be limited
			to a speed of warp five, except in
			cases of extreme emergency.
			Sir, the Klingons will observe
			these restrictions, but the
			Romulans will not.
			And what about the Ferengi... and
			the Cardassians for that matter?
			The Federation is sharing our data
			with all known warp-capable
			species.
			All we can hope is that they
			realize it's in their best
			interests to take similar action.
			Putting limits on warp speed is
			only going to prevent other rifts
			from forming. What are we going
			to do about this one?
			Unfortunately, right now there's
			not much we can do.
			My planet is not in immediate
			danger, but the gravitational
			shifts are already beginning to
			affect its orbit. Our climate is
			changing.
			Starfleet is setting up a weather
			control network for Hekaras Two.
			It's only a temporary solution,
			but it should suffice for now.
			We were lucky the rift formed as
			far away from the planet as it
			did. At least we have a little
			time to consider our options.
			If there are no further questions,
			you're dismissed.
			We should have the thermal
			stabilizers ready for the Hekarans
			in another day, sir.
			Very well.
			But now I can't help but wonder if
			all the while I was really helping
			to destroy the very thing I hold
			dear.
			It's not going to turn out that
			way, sir. We still have time to
			make it better.
