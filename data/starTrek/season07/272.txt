			Captain's Log: Stardate 47751.2.
			The Enterprise has arrived at
			Starbase Three One Zero for a
			meeting with Fleet Admiral
			Necheyev. This visit will also
			give us the opportunity to pick up
			a... member of the family.
			Here you go... your very own
			quarters.
			And they're as far away from mine
			as possible, so you won't even
			have to see me if you don't want
			to.
			Mom... you know that's not why I
			asked for my own quarters this --
			No, no. You don't have to
			explain. There comes a time in a
			young man's life when he doesn't
			want to stay with his poor old
			mother... I understand.
			I'll come visit you in the old
			Doctor's Home every Sunday.
			Come in.
			Is there a runaway cadet in here?
			If so, we may have to call
			security.
			Welcome back, Wes.
			Thanks.
			I was, of course, not serious
			about calling security. It was a
			joke.
			I got it, Data.
			So... how's life at the Academy?
			Great... just great.
			But it's... good to have a break.
			So do you plan on just lounging
			around while we have work to do?
			I'm... sure I can find some time
			to help, sir.
			Enjoy your time off, you've earned
			it.
			Thanks.
			Well... I think we better let him
			settle in.
			Good idea. Don't sleep your whole
			vacation away, Wes.
			Good-bye.
			See you later.
			It's really good to have you home,
			Wesley. Really.
			Thanks, Mom.
			Admiral Necheyev's just beamed
			aboard. Worf's escorting her up
			here now.
			Good.
			Earl Grey Tea... watercress
			sandwiches... Bularian canapes...
			Are you up for a promotion?
			I'm trying to establish a new
			relationship with the Admiral.
			There's been a certain amount
			of... tension between us in the
			past.
			Tension's not the word I would
			use...
			I'd like to get things started on
			a better note this time. I want
			to make her feel at ease... that
			she's welcome aboard the
			Enterprise...
			I don't know why she wouldn't feel
			welcome here.
			We don't have to like her Wil, we
			simply have to follow her orders.
			However, maintaining an atmosphere
			of confrontation serves no
			purpose.
			Admiral Necheyev, sir.
			Admiral, welcome aboard the
			Enterprise.
			Thank you.
			You two may leave.
			Thank you, Admiral.
			Captain...
			Admiral, may I offer you some --
			I'll come right to the point,
			Captain. A situation has
			developed on the Cardassian border
			that...
			Are those... Bularian canapes?
			Yes, as a matter of fact. I took
			the liberty of speaking to your
			aide, Commander Wrightwell... he
			said you were quite fond of them.
			That was very... thoughtful,
			Captain. Thank you.
			You were saying something about
			the Cardassians I believe...
			Yes. The Federation has just
			completed a very long and
			difficult series of negotiations
			regarding the final status of our
			border with the Cardassians.
			These will be the official
			boundaries... you'll notice that
			a demilitarized zone has also been
			created along the border. Neither
			side will be permitted to place
			military outposts, conduct fleet
			exercises, or station warships
			anywhere in the demilitarized
			area.
			This border will put several
			Federation colonies in Cardassian
			territory... and some Cardassian
			colonies in ours.
			The agreement is by no means
			perfect... neither side got
			everything they wanted... but
			everyone got something. And as
			someone once said, diplomacy is
			the art of the possible.
			Those colonies finding themselves
			on the wrong side of the border
			will have to be moved.
			The colonists are not going to be
			very happy about that... some of
			them have been there for decades.
			It won't be easy... but it is a
			reasonable price to pay for peace.
			Your mission is to evacuate the
			colony on Dorvan Five.
			Dorvan Five... that's where the
			group of North American Indians
			has settled, isn't it?
			Yes. They've been there for about
			twenty years... they've
			established a village in a small
			valley on the southern continent.
			Is there something wrong?
			Admiral... centuries ago, the
			North American Indians were
			forcibly displaced from their
			ancestral lands. This group on
			Dorvan Five originally left Earth
			two hundred years ago because they
			wanted to preserve their cultural
			identities.
			I am aware of that Captain...
			There are certain... disturbing
			historical parallels here. Once
			again, these people are being
			asked to leave their homes because
			of political decisions made by a
			distant government.
			An Indian representative was
			included in the deliberations of
			the Federation Council. His
			objections were noted,
			discussed... but ultimately
			rejected.
			Captain, the Indians colonized
			Dorvan only twenty years ago...
			and at that time they were warned
			the planet was hotly disputed by
			the Cardassians. The bottom line
			is... they never should have
			settled there in the first place.
			Then perhaps we should not have
			allowed them to settle the planet
			originally. But to go to them
			twenty years later and ask them to
			leave what is now their home...
			I made the same argument to the
			Federation Council. But it took
			three years to negotiate this
			treaty... some concessions had to
			be made... and this is one of
			them.
			What if the Indians should...
			refuse to evacuate?
			Then your orders are to remove
			them... by any means necessary.
			I understand your... moral
			objections, Captain. If you
			wish... I can find someone else to
			command the Enterprise for this
			mission.
			No. That won't be necessary.
			I don't envy you this task... but
			I do believe it is for the greater
			good.
			I understand.
			And... thank you for...
			... making me feel welcome.
			You are always welcome on this
			ship, Admiral.
			Come in.
			Oh. I'm sorry to disturb you,
			Mister Crusher. I assumed you
			would be up at this hour. I could
			come back later.
			No... no, sir. I... must have
			overslept. Come in.
			Coffee, black.
			Oh. Uh, can I get something for
			you, sir?
			No, that's quite all right. This
			was my first chance to welcome you
			back.
			Thank you. I appreciate that.
			So... how's Boothby?
			Fine, I guess.
			You guess?
			I haven't seen him in a while.
			To be honest, sir... Boothby was
			starting to get on my nerves a
			little bit.
			He always seemed to have an
			opinion about everything.
			I mean, I know he's a very...
			insightful... intelligent man...
			But you'd had enough of his
			insights.
			That's not quite what I meant,
			sir.
			Well, as I said, welcome back,
			Mister Crusher. I hope you enjoy
			your vacation. That's really all
			I came here to say.
			Wes -- there you are. You've got
			to take a look at this.
			Remember how we always talked
			about improving the quantum
			efficiency by creating a new
			plasma-dyne relay? Well, feast
			your eyes on this.
			You've only got one micro-fusion
			inter-relay in here... the
			converter interface will never
			hold up.
			Hey, I ran the diagnostics myself.
			This little baby will withstand
			over five hundred Cochranes of
			warp field stress.
			I don't think so. You better put
			a secondary phase inverter in
			there.
			In fact, this entire subprocessor
			matrix needs an overhaul.
			Well, I guess we can't have all
			the fancy new equipment they give
			you kids at the Academy. We have
			to make do with what we've got.
			Read the latest paper by Doctor
			Vassbinder... he has some
			brilliant new theories on warp
			propulsion inter-relays.
			A lot of this stuff is almost
			obsolete.
			What's wrong with you?
			Do you want my help or not?
			I was doing this for you... I
			thought you'd be interested in
			this.
			Well, I'm not.
			Captain's Log: Supplemental. The
			Enterprise has arrived at Dorvan
			Five and I have spoken to the
			Leader of the Tribal Council. He
			has agreed to meet with us this
			afternoon to discuss the
			situation.
			Anthwara... I am afraid there is
			very little I can do. The
			decision regarding this planet was
			made at the highest levels of the
			Federation.
			A decision that was made over our
			explicit objections.
			I must point out that when you
			first came to this world, you were
			warned that it was the subject of
			a dispute between the Federation
			and the Cardassians. You were
			asked not to settle here.
			Do you know how long we have
			searched for a home? Almost two
			hundred years. Then we found this
			world... Can you blame us for not
			wanting to give it up?
			I understand and respect the long
			journey of your people. But I
			believe we can help you find a new
			home.
			As you can see, there are three
			other planets in this sector that
			have environmental conditions
			similar to those here on Dorvan
			Five. They are all uninhabited...
			and could be colonized
			immediately.
			And if those worlds don't meet
			with your approval, then we'll
			find you other choices.
			You don't understand... the choice
			of this world was not limited
			to... "environmental conditions."
			There were other... more
			intangible concerns as well.
			My people have always had an...
			intimate bond with nature. We
			think of ourselves as being a part
			of it... and it being a part of
			us. One of the reasons our
			ancestors left Earth two hundred
			years ago was because that bond
			had been severed.
			They began to control the weather.
			We believe -- very strongly --
			that nature should not be "fixed"
			or controlled. Droughts and
			floods... tornadoes and
			hurricanes... these are natural
			events. By putting man above
			nature... an imbalance was
			created. We could no longer live
			in harmony with our environment.
			I can assure you that we will not
			impose a weather control system or
			anything else on your people.
			Whatever world you choose to
			colonize will be completely yours
			to do with as you please.
			Captain, once the bond between us
			and Earth had been broken, we had
			to find a planet where we could
			establish a new bond... a planet
			that would welcome us. When I
			came here twenty years ago, I was
			welcomed by the mountains... the
			rivers... the sky.
			He's laughing at you, Anthwara.
			He thinks you're talking about old
			superstition and nonsense.
			That's not true. I have a great
			deal of respect for your beliefs
			and the meaning they hold for your
			people.
			Then you should respect the fact
			that this planet holds a deeply
			spiritual significance for us. It
			took us two centuries to find a
			place where the mountains gave us
			permission to use their stone for
			our houses... where the rivers let
			us drink from their waters... and
			where the wind sang to us at
			night.
			We don't want to spend another two
			hundred years searching for what
			we already have.
			Captain, may I suggest that we
			adjourn for now... allow us all
			time to think about what's been
			said.
			Agreed. We will reconvene
			tomorrow.
			In the meantime, I would like to
			invite you all to the Enterprise
			this evening as our guests.
			Thank you, Captain. We look
			forward to it.
			Ever since you came aboard you've
			been moody, sullen and rude. I
			want to know what's going on.
			Nothing's going on, Mom. I just
			want to be left alone.
			No, that's not good enough. Your
			behavior in Engineering was
			inexcusable.
			Well, then that's my business
			isn't it? I don't need you
			telling me how to behave.
			I shouldn't have to -- you're a
			fourth year Starfleet cadet.
			You're expected to have a certain
			level of maturity.
			Maybe I'm sick of living up to
			other people's expectations...
			maybe I'm sick of following rules
			and regulations... did you ever
			think about that?
			... so I've been trying to
			familiarize myself with the
			history and traditions of your
			people. I was quite interested to
			learn that it was your grandfather --
			Katowa -- who led the group of
			Indians who initially left Earth
			two centuries ago.
			He was a... great man. When I was
			a little boy, I was so proud to
			know that he was my grandfather.
			In fact, I think I was a little
			too proud of it... I remember the
			other children getting tired of
			hearing me talk about him.
			It must have been a very difficult
			decision for your grandfather to
			make... uprooting your people...
			leading them into the unknown for
			an undetermined amount of time...
			not even knowing if you ever would
			find a new home.
			There was great deal of
			opposition. Even my own father
			was against it... but when Katowa
			made his decision -- that was it.
			My father never said another word.
			It's never easy to leave one's
			home... to give up the safe and
			familiar. But there are times
			when the greater good demands that
			sacrifices be made... I'm sure
			your grandfather knew that.
			His grandson does too. But there
			are also times when a people have
			sacrificed too much... when they
			must hold on to what they have...
			even if it means standing up
			against overwhelming opposition.
			What do you know about your
			family, Captain?
			A great deal actually. My father
			was a strong believer in passing
			along the family history and
			traditions.
			Tell me about your family. We
			have very strong ties to our
			ancestors... we believe their
			actions guide us even now.
			Knowing more about your family
			might help me to better understand
			you.
			Besides, it's always a good idea
			to understand your opponent in any
			negotiation.
			I hope that by the end of this
			matter, you won't look at me as
			your opponent.
			My family. Well... our roots in
			Western Europe go back to the time
			of Charlemagne.
			Sorry I'm late.
			We'll talk about that later.
			Wesley Crusher?
			Yes?
			I am Lakanta.
			I'm... glad to meet you... can I
			get you a drink or --
			I have been waiting for you.
			For... me?
			I have known you would come to us
			for the past two years.
			I'm... not sure what you mean.
			Two years ago, I went into the
			Habak and began a vision quest.
			While I was there, I saw many
			things... talked to many animals
			and spirits... and I saw you.
			There're many things you don't
			understand yet... but you will.
			I don't mean to be rude, but I
			wish you'd stop talking about me
			in the future tense.
			I know your spirit's troubled,
			Wesley. That's why you've come to
			us. We can help you find the
			answers you seek.
			I just don't know what to do, Jean-Luc.
			It's as if someone took my
			son away and left this stranger in
			his place.
			In a sense, that's exactly what's
			happened. Wesley left here three
			years ago as a boy... but now he's
			a young man. That can't be an
			easy transition for a mother... or
			a son.
			Well, it's gone beyond just the
			two of us...
			I heard about the incident with
			Geordi.
			Have you heard about the Academy?
			I called Admiral Brand this
			afternoon. She said his grades
			are falling... he's becoming
			remote, defensive... if he's not
			careful, he'll wash out next term.
			I don't mean to make light of that
			by any means... but I must say
			that I went through the same
			thing.
			Oh, yes. I nearly washed out my
			sophomore year... there were a lot
			of different factors... my
			father's death... a teenage love
			affair with the wrong girl... the
			point is, I realized what was
			happening to me and I pulled
			myself out of it. I'm sure Wesley
			will do the same.
			Jean-Luc... will you have a talk
			with him? Maybe this is the kind
			of thing a boy -- a young man has
			to discuss with another man.
			I don't think he wants either of
			us to talk to him right now.
			But he needs help.
			Perhaps. But he has to want that
			help. If he doesn't, then any
			effort on our part might only push
			him further away.
			Let him work this out on his own,
			Beverly.
			How long have you been watching
			me?
			Since you beamed down.
			Well, I'm here. What am I
			supposed to do now?
			I don't know.
			I thought you were going to...
			help me "find some answers".
			Yes. But the answers will be to
			your questions.
			What questions? I don't even know
			why I came here.
			I told you before your spirit was
			troubled. Was I wrong?
			I don't know about my... spirit,
			but I guess you could say I'm a
			little... troubled.
			Then perhaps you do have questions
			to be answered. Maybe your
			answers are here... maybe they're
			not. Will it hurt to look?
			Tell me about this... Habak. You
			said you had some kind of a vision
			there?
			The Habak is a holy place... we
			hold many of our rituals and
			ceremonies there. It's sacred to
			us.
			What's sacred to you, Wesley?
			To me? Uh... well, I consider a
			lot of things... important... I
			respect a lot of things... but I
			don't know if I consider anything
			sacred.
			Stop.
			Look around us. What do you think
			would be sacred to us here?
			Well... maybe some of the designs
			on the walls... the necklace
			you're wearing... ?
			Everything is sacred to us. The
			buildings... the food... the
			sky... the dirt under your
			feet... and you. Whether you
			believe in your own spirit or
			not... we believe in it. So you
			are a sacred person here, Wesley.
			I think that's the first time
			anyone's used that particular word
			to describe me.
			So if you're sacred... then you
			have to treat yourself with
			respect... to do otherwise is to
			desecrate something holy.
			Is that... what you think I'm
			doing?
			Only you can decide that.
			Maybe I don't have... a lot of
			respect for myself right now.
			Then perhaps it's time for your
			own vision quest to begin.
			Anthwara... I deeply regret that
			we have not been able to reach an
			agreement.
			But, to put it bluntly, I cannot
			take no for an answer.
			This planet will be handed over to
			the Cardassian government as per
			the terms of the border agreement.
			I am very sorry... but you will
			have to leave.
			And if we do not?
			Then I will be forced... to remove
			you... by any means necessary.
			A familiar threat... from a white
			man.
			This is not a racial issue... it
			has nothing to do with ancient
			hatreds... or with the fact that
			we have different colored skin.
			I might just as easily have been
			a Vulcan or Andorian captain. The
			orders from Starfleet would have
			been the same.
			We know you won't take us from our
			land, Captain.
			Anthwara... I may regret doing it,
			but --
			When you first came to us, we
			didn't know why you were the one
			sent here by the Federation... but
			we knew there had to be a reason.
			To us, nothing is truly random.
			So we searched for the true reason
			you were sent. We didn't find it
			until last night.
			Are you familiar with the Pueblo
			Revolt of sixteen eighty?
			I am. Several Indian tribes rose
			up against their Spanish overlords
			and drove them out of what is now
			called New Mexico.
			Ten years later, the Spanish
			returned to reconquer the area.
			They were... brutal... I would
			use the word savage. They killed
			our people by the hundreds...
			maimed thousands more.
			One of these killers was named
			Javier Maribona-Picard. Your
			ancestor.
			I was... unaware of that
			incident... or of the man you
			named.
			But that was seven hundred years
			ago and I don't see how it has any
			bearing on --
			That is why you have come to us:
			to erase a stain of blood that
			your family has worn for twenty-three
			generations.
			Captain... are you all right?
			We should return to the
			Enterprise.
			Mister Worf... what's going on?
			We have... unwelcome visitors.
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise.
			I am Gul Evek.
			What are these people still doing
			here? The evacuation should be
			well underway by now.
			May I have a word with you...
			alone?
			As you wish.
			Wait here.
			It was my understanding that there
			would be no Cardassian presence on
			this world for another six weeks.
			Your arrival here may upset some
			very... delicate negotiations.
			Negotiations? The status of this
			planet has been settled... what
			are you negotiating?
			I would be happy to explain it to
			you... but for now, I must ask
			that you and your men leave...
			immediately.
			We were sent here to make a
			preliminary survey of the
			buildings and equipment being left
			behind. I have no intention of
			leaving until our mission is
			complete.
			Very well... complete your
			mission...
			But, this is still Federation
			territory, Gul Evek... until that
			changes, this world is under my
			jurisdiction... and I will
			protect it.
			Is that a threat?
			It is a fact... and I suggest you
			keep it in mind as you conduct
			your... survey.
			This is the Habak... the focal
			point of our lives.
			Strangers are not welcome here...
			Wait a minute. When I asked to
			come here, you said it would be --
			You are not a stranger. I told
			you, I've seen you here before.
			What are those?
			They are Mansara... dolls
			representing different spirits who
			come to this place.
			This one looks like... a Klingon.
			Yes. Our culture is rooted in the
			past, but it is not limited to the
			past. The spirits of Klingons,
			Vulcans, Ferengi come to us just
			as the bear, the coyote, the
			parrot. There is no difference.
			What... should I do?
			Start the fire... then sit... and
			wait.
			What am I waiting for?
			This is your journey, Wesley. I
			can open the door for you, but
			only you can go through it.
			Is there any indication that the
			Tribal Council will change their
			position in the near future?
			No, sir.
			Then I see no other choice...
			Admiral, I have every reason to
			believe that these people will
			resist any attempt to remove them.
			I strongly urge you to request an
			emergency session of the
			Federation Council. The issue of
			Dorvan Five must be reopened.
			Captain... I made that request two
			days ago. The answer was no.
			I'm sorry... but you have your
			orders. Starfleet out.
			So much for a reprieve from
			Starfleet.
			Anthwara believes that I am
			responsible for the crimes of one
			of my ancestors against his
			people...
			Do you believe that?
			No, of course not. I respect
			their beliefs... but that can't
			have any bearing on our mission.
			But at the same time... I wonder
			if a dark chapter in my family
			history is about to repeat itself.
			If these people take up arms
			against us... there's no way to
			foresee the consequences.
			Picard to Worf. Will you come in
			here for a moment?
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf... begin preparations
			to remove the inhabitants from
			Dorvan Five.
			Aye, sir.
			Wesley... Wesley...
			Wesley...
			Dad...
			You've reached the end, Wesley.
			The end... the end of what?
			This journey. The one you started
			a long time ago... when I left you
			and your mother.
			You mean... when you died.
			You set out on a journey that
			wasn't your own. Now it's time to
			find the path that is truly yours.
			Don't follow me any further.
			I... don't understand.
			I... don't understand.
			Yes, you do. It's just hard for
			you to accept.
			Good-bye, Wesley. Good luck.
			Dad -- wait!
			Mister Crusher... Are you all
			right?
			Yeah... I'm fine, Worf...
			Lay out a confinement beam trace
			along the Southwestern edge of the
			village. Be discreet -- we do not
			wish to alarm the population.
			What are you doing?
			We are laying out Transporter
			coordinates for a security
			perimeter. It may become
			necessary to remove these people
			by force.
			Worf... we can't do this. These
			people deserve better than to be
			taken from their homes...
			I understand. But this is not the
			time or the place to --
			Do you know what they're doing?
			They're preparing to beam you away --
			to take you to their ship! You're
			not going to just let them do
			that, are you?
			No, we won't.
			Leave. Now.
			Inexcusable. You defied the
			orders of the ranking officer on
			the scene... put the entire Away
			Team in jeopardy... and made an
			already tense situation worse.
			Your actions reflect poorly on
			this ship and on that uniform. I
			want an explanation Mister
			Crusher, and I want it now.
			What you're doing down there is
			wrong.
			Captain, these people aren't just
			some random group of colonists...
			they're a unique culture... one
			that predates the Federation and
			Starfleet...
			That does not change the fact that
			my orders are to --
			I know Admiral Necheyev gave you
			an order and that she was given an
			order from the Federation
			Council... but it's still wrong.
			That is not your decision to make,
			Cadet.
			Now, I don't know what's gotten
			into you lately, and right now I
			don't care.
			But I will tell you this -- while
			you wear that uniform, you will
			obey every order you're given and
			you will conform to Starfleet
			regulations and rules of conduct.
			Is that clear?
			Yes, it is.
			But I'm not going to wear this
			uniform anymore. I'm resigning
			from the Academy.
			Riker to Captain.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			Gul Evek wants to meet with you to
			discuss the... situation on the
			surface.
			Let him come aboard. I'll meet
			with him in here.
			Aye, sir.
			Why are you doing this?
			I told you, Starfleet's not for
			me.
			Dammit, Wesley.
			I may not be able to stop you from
			throwing your entire life away,
			but you are going to stand here
			and explain it to me first. You
			owe me that much.
			I saw Dad today. He told me not
			to follow him.
			You... what?
			I... was participating in an
			Indian ritual... I had a vision.
			And in it... Dad came to me. He
			told me not to follow him... that
			I had to find my own path.
			Is that what this is all about?
			Some mystical vision told you to
			leave the Academy and now you're
			packing your bags?
			It's more than that... I think
			I've known this was the right
			thing to do for a long time... I
			just couldn't admit it to myself.
			But you always said being at the
			Academy was... the best thing that
			ever happened to you.
			I know. And for a while it was.
			But as time went on... and
			graduation got closer... I started
			feeling... depressed. I thought
			it would go away... but it only
			got worse.
			Why didn't you ever say anything?
			I guess I didn't want to
			disappoint you... or Captain
			Picard... or my friends. You were
			all so... proud of me.
			I'd be proud of you regardless of
			what you were doing, Wes. I love
			you no matter what.
			I know that, Mom. Maybe the truth
			is that I was afraid of
			disappointing myself.
			I just never questioned the fact
			that someday I'd be in Starfleet.
			But when Dad said not to follow
			him, I just knew he was right. It
			seems... so clear now.
			Maybe it's partly my fault... I
			never realized the kind of
			pressure we all must've put on
			you... to be exactly what we
			expected you to be...
			I don't blame you, Mom. It was my
			decision -- it always has been.
			You remember the alien from Tau
			Ceti who could control warp fields
			with his mind... ?
			The Traveller.
			He told Captain Picard a long time
			ago that you were... special --
			like Mozart. That you were
			destined for something...
			different from the rest of us...
			Maybe... this is the first step...
			What are you planning to do now?
			Well, for the time being... I'm
			going to stay with these Indians.
			Wes... you realize they won't be
			down there much longer. The
			Captain's orders are pretty
			explicit on that point.
			I know. But I have to go back...
			even if it's just for a while.
			I love you, Wes.
			I love you, too.
			You shouldn't be here, Wesley.
			Why?
			Bring them over here.
			Why have you taken these men
			prisoner?
			They were invading our homes...
			violating our privacy... this is
			not their world. They have no
			right to be here.
			The terms of the treaty do give
			them the right to... survey this
			planet.
			We don't recognize that treaty.
			We're not going to let the
			Cardassians have Dorvan Five. No
			matter what the cost.
			That's right. We're not leaving.
			Get out of here! Go back to the
			Federation and leave us alone.
			This is our home. You're not
			wanted here. etc.
			Worf to Picard. An armed group of
			Indians has taken two Cardassian
			prisoners. The situation is
			extremely volatile. Request
			instructions.
			Stand-by, Mister Worf.
			Have your ship lock-on to your
			people and beam them out of there
			now, before something happens.
			My people? What about these
			Indians of yours -- they've taken
			hostages. This planet is ours,
			Captain, and we will not be chased
			away by some unruly crowd.
			Gul Evek to the Vetar.
			This is Glin Telak aboard the
			Vetar. Go Ahead.
			Two of our men on the surface have
			been taken prisoner. Prepare to
			send an armed squad to rescue them
			and to occupy the village.
			Gul Evek, those people down there
			are Federation citizens and I am
			sworn to protect them. If your
			troops attack the village, my
			security forces will respond...
			I hope you realize the
			consequences of Federation
			officers firing on Cardassian
			troops...
			I do. That's why we need to stop
			this now, before it's too late.
			I cannot allow you to hold these
			men as prisoners.
			You have no authority here.
			I don't understand...
			You've found a new beginning for
			yourself... the first steps on a
			journey that few humans will ever
			take.
			Who are you?
			The Traveller...
			I've been waiting a long time for
			this moment, Wesley.
			So my experience in the Habak...
			my vision of my father... the
			things he said to me... those were
			all your doing?
			I merely opened the door for
			you... what you experienced came
			from your own mind... your own
			spirit if you wish.
			I hoped that you would open your
			mind to new possibilities...
			And you did. You pulled yourself
			out of time... don't you see?
			You've evolved to a new level...
			you're ready to explore places
			where thought and energy combine
			in ways you cannot even imagine.
			I will be your guide... if you'd
			like.
			What about them? I can't just
			leave them like this.
			They must find their own
			destinies, Wesley. It is not our
			place to interfere.
			But...
			Have faith in their abilities to
			solve their problems on their own.
			The Cardassian ship is powering
			its weapons and Transporters.
			This is the Vetar to Gul Evek.
			Our troops are under attack. They
			are requesting immediate
			assistance. What are your orders?
			Evek, the last war caused massive
			destruction... took millions of
			lives. Don't send our two peoples
			back down that path... not like
			this. History is in your hands --
			right now. Give us one last
			chance for peace.
			Gul Evek! What are your orders?
			Can we open fire?
			Evek to the Vetar... lock on to
			our troops on the surface... and
			beam them aboard.
			But sir, they have been fired upon
			and --
			Those are my orders. Carry them
			out.
			Yes, sir.
			I had three sons, Captain. I lost
			two of them in the war. I don't
			want to lose the last one.
			Beam up our Away Team immediately,
			Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			Anthwara... I want to make
			absolutely sure you understand the
			implications of this agreement.
			By giving up your status as
			Federation citizens... any future
			request you or your people make
			for assistance from Starfleet will
			go unanswered. You will be on
			your own... and under Cardassian
			jurisdiction.
			I understand, Captain. And we are
			prepared to take that risk.
			Will the Cardassian government
			honor the agreement you've made
			here?
			I believe that I can convince them
			this is an... equitable solution.
			I cannot speak for every
			Cardassian you will encounter...
			but if you leave us alone... I
			suspect that we will do the same.
			Will this be acceptable to
			Starfleet Command?
			It will take some doing... but
			with Admiral Necheyev's support,
			I think they'll go along with it
			in the end.
			Then if there is nothing else, I
			will return to my ship. I have a
			rather... long report to write.
			Captain... Anthwara...
			I was right, Captain... you didn't
			take us from our land... and you
			have wiped clean a very old stain
			of blood.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 47755.3.
			The Enterprise is preparing to
			leave Dorvan Five. But former
			cadet Wesley Crusher will be
			staying behind. It seems that
			during the crisis, he met... an
			old friend.
			Where will you go?
			The Traveller said that my...
			studies will begin with these
			people. He said they're... aware
			of many things... and that I
			could learn a lot from them.
			Just what I needed... more
			studying.
			Somehow I think you'll manage.
			Me too.
			Well... good luck, Mister...
			... good luck Wesley.
			Thank you, sir. For a lot of
			things.
			Remember to... dress warmly in
			those... other planes of
			existence.
			I will.
			Good-bye, Mom.
			Energize.
