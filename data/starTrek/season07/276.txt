			Captain's Log, Stardate 47941.7.
			The Enterprise is en route to a
			briefing on the situation in the
			Demilitarized Zone along the
			Cardassian border. Meanwhile, we
			are celebrating the return of an
			old friend.
			Welcome home.
			Thanks. It's good to be back.
			Congratulations on your promotion --
			Lieutenant.
			Same to you -- Commander.
			Thank you.
			I hear Advanced Tactical Training
			is a real picnic...
			Right...
			Did you see the buffet?
			Yes, that's real Bajoran foraiga.
			It wasn't easy to find.
			You shouldn't have gone to all
			this trouble...
			Where are your new quarters?
			Deck eight, section four.
			What do you plan to --
			Picard to Lieutenant Ro.
			Go ahead, sir.
			Please report to the Bridge.
			Yes, sir.
			Excuse me.
			Captain...
			You seemed a bit overwhelmed by
			all the attention... I thought you
			could use a break.
			To tell you the truth, I could...
			I want to see everyone, but I
			think I'd rather do it one at a
			time.
			You're looking fit, Lieutenant.
			Tactical Training must have agreed
			with you.
			You know me -- I enjoy a
			challenge.
			That school is more than a
			challenge. Half the class washes
			out every year.
			Somehow I knew you wouldn't be one
			of those.
			I want you to know I appreciate
			your recommending me.
			If it weren't for you, sir -- my
			life would be a much different one
			right now.
			Bridge to Captain --
			Go ahead.
			We're receiving a distress signal
			from a Cardassian ship near the
			Demilitarized Zone.
			Change course to intercept -- I'm
			on my way.
			I'd like you at the Conn,
			Lieutenant.
			Report.
			The Cardassian ship relayed a
			distress signal but it was cut off
			before they could tell us what was
			wrong.
			I've got the ship on long-range
			sensors.
			It appears to be under attack --
			by several small ships.
			Can you identify them?
			No, sir. They aren't transmitting
			identification codes.
			I will scan their warp signatures.
			Sir, sensors indicate that the
			attacking vessels are Federation
			ships.
			We're coming into visual range.
			On screen.
			Those are Federation ships.
			Isolate one and magnify.
			The Maquis...
			Open a channel.
			To all Maquis ships -- call off
			your attack or we will be forced
			to engage you.
			No response.
			You are Federation citizens. Your
			actions are in violation of our
			treaty with the Cardassians. Call
			off your attack.
			Are we in firing range?
			Not yet, sir.
			Arm phasers and photon torpedoes
			and stand by.
			I never thought we'd be firing on
			our own people to protect a
			Cardassian ship...
			The Maquis ships are regrouping...
			they are closing in on the
			Cardassian vessel.
			The Cardassian's shields are down
			to thirty percent.
			They may not be able to withstand
			another hit.
			Sir, we are within weapons range.
			Mister Worf, can you detonate a
			torpedo spread between the Maquis
			ships and the Cardassians?
			Yes, sir.
			Do it.
			The Maquis are breaking formation --
			they are withdrawing.
			Signal the Cardassians that we're
			standing by to assist them if they
			have any wounded.
			Do your people have experience
			treating Cardassians?
			Yes. Now please, sit still.
			Gul Evek. I'm sorry we weren't
			able to come to your aid sooner.
			I suppose we're lucky you came at
			all... lately Starfleet seems to
			look the other way when the Maquis
			attack.
			I assure you that's not the case.
			We're doing everything we can to
			control them.
			The fact that they attacked my
			ship suggests your efforts have
			met with limited success.
			The Maquis came at us with photon
			torpedoes and type eight phasers --
			tell me, Captain, how do you
			suppose a group of civilians
			acquired that kind of weaponry?
			It was certainly not through
			official channels.
			You don't think the fact that some
			of the Maquis are former Starfleet
			officers has anything to do with
			it?
			Starfleet does not condone the
			Maquis' actions in the
			Demilitarized Zone.
			Any more than your government
			condones paramilitary actions by
			Cardassian civilians.
			We have taken measures to deal
			with our colonists who have armed
			themselves.
			Considering that they destroyed a
			Juhryan freighter less than a week
			ago, I'd say your efforts have met
			with limited success.
			Give our military the right to
			operate in the Zone for one week,
			and we'll put a stop to
			paramilitary activity once and for
			all.
			What you're proposing would only
			perpetuate the cycle of violence.
			Captain, if the Maquis aren't
			stopped, this situation is going
			to escalate to the point where the
			Cardassian military will have no
			choice but to take matters into
			its own hands.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. Gul
			Evek and his crew have left the
			Enterprise, and we have proceeded
			to our rendezvous with Admiral
			Nechayev.
			No Bularian canapes this time,
			Captain?
			Twice seemed to be pushing it a
			little...
			It's just as well.
			They're extremely fattening.
			You missed Gul Evek by a matter of
			hours. I asked him to stay -- I
			thought perhaps an admiral's
			assurances would convince him that
			we are trying to deal with the
			Maquis situation.
			Evek manages to make the
			Cardassians sound like helpless
			sheep being preyed on by
			Federation wolves. The truth is,
			we caught the Cardassian
			government supplying its colonies
			in the Demilitarized Zone with
			weapons.
			Gul Evek assures me that practice
			has stopped.
			Ah. How comforting.
			Admiral... this Maquis situation
			has you worried...
			It's a mess... and it just keeps
			getting worse. I never imagined
			I'd have to worry about Federation
			citizens doing violence to others.
			Frankly, I can understand why our
			colonists have taken up arms --
			Starfleet isn't there to protect
			them anymore.
			Believe me, Captain, if I were
			living that close to the
			Cardassians I'd keep a phaser
			under my pillow, too.
			But in the last few weeks we've
			seen signs that the Maquis are
			moving beyond self-defense. Their
			ranks are growing... they've
			acquired ships, weapons... they
			seem to be preparing for a more
			aggressive military posture.
			We have to put a stop to them...
			before the entire Demilitarized
			Zone ignites.
			But before we can stop them -- we
			have to find them. They seem to
			be scattered in small cells around
			the Zone. And we don't have
			reliable intelligence about any of
			them.
			Perhaps you need an undercover
			operative.
			Our thinking exactly. We intend
			to infiltrate their organization.
			And the person we want to do it is
			aboard your ship right now.
			Starfleet wants me to infiltrate
			the Maquis?
			Because of your recent training...
			because you're Bajoran... and
			because of your past troubles with
			Starfleet -- you'll have a certain
			credibility.
			Well, that's certainly true.
			And just when would this mission
			begin?
			Immediately.
			I see.
			I've spent the better part of my
			life fighting the Cardassians...
			I never thought I'd be helping
			them out.
			This is a rare case where our
			interests coincide with theirs --
			we both want peace in the
			Demilitarized Zone.
			I've heard a lot about the Maquis.
			One of my instructors in Tactical
			Training... a Lieutenant Commander
			in Starfleet -- a man I admired
			and respectded... was sympathetic
			to them. He resigned and left to
			join them.
			We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant.
			Our civilian population in the
			Demilitarized Zone is in a
			difficult situation.
			But sympathy ends at a certain
			point. The peace treaty isn't
			just a piece of paper. If the
			Maquis force us into a war with
			Cardassia, it could mean hundreds
			of thousands of lives.
			Laren, two years ago, Starfleet
			would never have tapped you for
			this mission. They must have a
			lot of confidence in you now.
			The way I see it... there's at
			least one good reason to take this
			mission, sir.
			That's to validate your faith in
			me.
			We are looking for a Bajoran
			woman, dark hair.
			She is responsible for the death
			of a Cardassian soldier.
			If we learn that she has been
			here, this establishment will be
			closed down.
			You say she had dark hair?
			Yes.
			She was here... you just missed
			her.
			Do you know where she went?
			No.
			Nice meeting you --
			Thanks.
			Did you kill that Cardassian?
			Starfleet thinks I did. That's
			reason enough to hide.
			Why did you tell them I'd left?
			There are worse things a person
			could do than kill a Cardassian
			soldier.
			You don't often meet someone
			willing to say that out loud.
			In the Zone, there are a lot of us
			who feel that way.
			I'd like to meet people like that.
			Don't be afraid. You're not in
			danger here.
			What's your name?
			Did you kill that Cardassian
			soldier?
			Who are you?
			The people who saved you from
			Starfleet.
			Thanks.
			But I'll be leaving now.
			Do you even know what planet
			you're on?
			Ronara Prime.
			Not anymore.
			Where am I then?
			We're not going to tell you that
			until we know more about you.
			Like what?
			Did you kill that Cardassian?
			Yes.
			That's a risky thing to do in the
			Demilitarized Zone. You can end
			up being hunted by Starfleet and
			the Cardassians.
			Then... why did he risk bringing
			me here?
			We're asking the questions. Who
			are you?
			My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in
			the Bajoran camps...
			That would explain why you have no
			love for Cardassians.
			I know what they're capable of.
			They tortured my father to
			death... and forced me to watch.
			Where do you live now?
			Nowhere...
			I was a Starfleet officer. But I
			was court martialed and spent time
			in the stockade on Jaros Two. I'm
			not exactly what you'd call
			Starfleet material.
			When were you on Jaros?
			What difference does it make?
			We want to check your story. When
			were you there?
			Starfleet let me out about three
			years ago because I agreed to do
			some work for them... mostly
			having to do with Bajor. But I
			got tired of watching them placate
			the Cardassians and left.
			You resigned?
			Not officially.
			That's part of the reason they're
			looking for me.
			What were you doing on Ronara?
			Look, I've answered enough of your
			questions -- I'd like to know who
			you people are.
			Let's just say... we sympathize
			with those who oppose Cardassia.
			Are you Maquis?
			What if we were... ?
			If you were... then I would ask if
			I could join you and help you
			fight.
			We will check your story.
			Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on
			her.
			My circulation isn't what it used
			to be...
			Come... let's stretch our legs.
			Aren't you taking a chance by
			letting me see all this? What if
			my story doesn't check out -- what
			if I'm not who I say I am?
			Then we'll have a problem, won't
			we?
			You are Maquis, aren't you?
			Many people here are.
			Starfleet considers you outlaws.
			They're afraid you'll destroy the
			peace treaty.
			They don't understand the
			situation here in the Zone.
			I lived on Juhraya... the colony
			suddenly found itself in
			Cardassian territory when the
			treaty was signed. Some of us
			chose to stay and take our
			chances.
			One night I was dragged from my
			bed and beaten. The authorities
			clucked their tongues and agreed
			it was an unfortunate incident...
			and did nothing.
			I'm not surprised. The
			Cardassians intend to make life so
			unpleasant for Federation citizens
			that they'll leave.
			Exactly. And no one seems to see
			that except the Maquis.
			How old were you when your father
			was killed?
			I'd rather not talk about it.
			Are you hungry? Would you like
			something?
			No. Thank you.
			Hasperat.
			You like hasperat?
			An old Bajoran friend of mine used
			to make it. Although his was much
			stronger.
			He died years ago... fighting the
			Cardassian occupation of Bajor...
			I miss his company... and his
			hasperat...
			My father made the strongest
			hasperat you've ever tasted.
			Everything else seems mild by
			comparison.
			Did he teach you how to make it?
			Yes. But I haven't tried it in
			years.
			If you would make the brine for
			truly strong hasperat -- and I
			mean eye-watering, tongue-searing
			strong -- you would make an old
			man very happy.
			I'd enjoy making it again.
			Macias...
			I checked with my sources at
			Starfleet...
			Her story's true.
			I was sure it was.
			Kalita -- she'll stay with you
			until we can find her a room.
			Why aren't you with the others?
			Kalita told me to stay here -- she
			had things to do.
			You've been here a week and she
			still doesn't trust you.
			We're meeting to discuss
			strategy...
			So that's what she meant by
			"things to do." Kalita reminds
			me of someone I knew during the
			occupation... being a part of the
			resistance was the only thing he
			cared about. It was his identity.
			That does sound like Kalita...
			Don't get me wrong, I was glad to
			have him on my side... but he was
			hard to be around.
			Sometimes people would stay up
			late... telling stories -- you
			know, trying to forget about our
			troubles for a while. Kanore
			would come out of his tent in a
			huff and tell everyone to be quiet --
			that we should get some rest so
			we'd have "strength for our
			struggle."
			What would people do?
			We'd ignore him.
			That sounds like the only way to
			handle a person like that...
			I have to go... the meeting's
			about to start.
			Ah... there you are.
			We've just heard a disturbing
			rumor.
			Another rumor?
			One that I think we should take
			seriously. A trader coming from
			Pendi Two said he could verify
			that the Cardassians are going to
			start supplying their colonists
			with bio-genic weapons.
			I thought every shipment coming
			into the Zone was searched...
			The Cardassians always seem to
			find a way to get around problems
			like that.
			We have to make a preemptive
			strike. Send a message to
			Cardassia that we won't sit still
			and let them kill us with toxins.
			Agreed. But we can't mount a
			strike without medical supplies --
			and our stockpile is dangerously
			low.
			If we put in a request for more,
			it'll draw suspicion.
			I can get medical supplies.
			I served on the Enterprise. They
			keep extra med-kits on hand for
			relief missions.
			You're wanted by Starfleet.
			They're not going to give you medkits
			just because you ask.
			I have no intention of asking. I
			intend to take them.
			How? The Enterprise is a
			fortress.
			I know how its security systems
			work. Give me a ship... I can do
			it.
			It's madness...
			We can't trust her with something
			like this. We don't know anything
			about her.
			I know... that she can make very
			strong hasperat.
			What?
			We need medical supplies. I think
			we should let her try.
			All right. But I'm going with
			her.
			I could use an extra hand at the
			controls. And a witness.
			I set the transporter confinement
			parameters to maximum -- we should
			be able to fill our hold with
			medical supplies in just a single
			beam out.
			I had no idea it was going to be
			so easy...
			We're approaching the Federation
			border...
			How do you plan to get out of the
			Demilitarized Zone without being
			searched at one of the checkpoints?
			We're going to cross the border
			here.
			There are sensor buoys all along
			the border. If we cross anywhere
			other than a checkpoint, Starfleet
			will send a ship to investigate.
			With the right security codes, we
			can disable the proximity
			detectors on the buoys.
			Starfleet changes those codes all
			the time.
			I know the encryption algorithims.
			If I can access the bouy's
			protocol subsystem I should be
			able to figure out the codes.
			Should be able to?
			Do you want this mission to
			succeed?
			Of course I do -- we need those
			medical supplies.
			In that case, let me do my job.
			I'm in...
			What's wrong?
			If I don't input the right code in
			the next twenty seconds, we'll
			trigger the proximity alarm.
			I'm getting us out of sensor
			range.
			Don't. If we break the com-link,
			we won't be able to try again.
			It worked... until they change the
			access codes again, we can cross
			the border here.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47943.2.
			It has been over a week since
			Lieutenant Ro left the
			Enterprise... we have yet to
			receive any communication from
			her.
			We picked up a request for
			emergency assistance from a
			Federation science ship in the
			Topin system.
			Are there any other ships in the
			vicinity?
			We're the closest.
			Helm, set course for the Topin
			system.
			Signal the science ship that we're
			on our way.
			It is unlikely that they would
			receive our communication. The
			Topin system contains an unstable
			binary-star. It generates
			significant subspace interference.
			Will we be able to use our sensors
			to find them?
			Most of our sensor systems will be
			ineffective, although our
			directional array may be able to
			cut through the interference.
			But that array has such a narrow
			scan field...
			-- we might as well break out the
			palm-beacons and try to find them
			that way...
			This is insane... we're sitting
			here with no sensors, blind to the
			outside -- waiting for a galaxy
			class Starship to come swooping
			down on us...
			Don't worry... it'll be hard for
			them to locate us with just their
			directional sensors. Besides,
			they're looking for a damaged
			science ship that wants to be
			found...
			They're here... Standby to engage
			thrusters.
			Anything?
			No, sir. It will take
			approximately six hours to scan
			this system.
			Sir -- the distress call is being
			repeated.
			Can you locate the signal?
			I am attempting to do so.
			All stop.
			They're scanning our last
			position.
			All right, I've locked onto their
			sensor beam. I'm going to use it
			to maneuver into transporter
			range.
			How are we going to beam through
			their shields?
			We can't -- if we're going to get
			those medical supplies, we're
			going to have to take this ship
			through their shields.
			Sir, I am scanning the area from
			which the distress signal was
			sent... but I am unable to detect
			a vessel.
			Captain -- the computer has
			detected a piggyback communication
			on the last distress signal...
			Can you decode it?
			It will take a few moments.
			Do it.
			The Enterprise shields have a weak
			point... When the ship is at
			impulse, the thrust destabilizes
			the shield configuration right at
			this point.
			I'm going to try to punch through
			there.
			Won't they detect us?
			They'll know something's
			penetrated the shields, but with
			all the interference it'll take
			them a few seconds to find us.
			We'll have to beam the medical
			supplies aboard and get out fast.
			The message is difficult to
			decode... the interference has
			garbled much of the transmission.
			But it seems to be from Lieutenant
			Ro.
			Ro... is on that ship... ?
			Sir, a vessel of some kind is
			attempting to penetrate our aft
			shields.
			Let it through.
			We're going to make it...
			All right, we're in...
			Energizing.
			Let's get out of here...
			Captain, a quantity of medical
			supplies was beamed out of Cargo
			Bay Seven.
			The vessel that penetrated our
			shields is of the same design as
			the ships used by the Maquis.
			It is moving off...
			Let it go.
			There must be someone with her...
			We should make it look like we're
			trying to stop them.
			Lock phasers on their previous
			position and fire.
			Now we know what they mean by
			Advanced Tactical Training...
			You took your ship through their
			shields?
			Ro parked us between their warp
			nacelles. I thought she was
			crazy, but it worked. She knew
			exactly what she was doing.
			Well, done.
			We should inventory the
			supplies... find out what we
			have.
			I'll see you later...
			Well... it seems that Kalita's
			decided you're not a Federation
			spy after all...
			She's suspicious of everyone at
			first. And rightly so -- we've
			learned to be cautious with
			strangers.
			I understand...
			But I've known since I first met
			you -- in your heart, you're one
			of us...
			Captain's Log, supplemental.
			Having earned the Maquis' trust
			with her raid on the Enterprise,
			Lieutenant Ro has been given
			access to a ship and allowed to
			leave the settlement by herself.
			There are rumors that the
			Cardassians are supplying their
			colonists with bio-genic weapons.
			Frankly, I find it hard to
			believe. Every ship going into
			the Demilitarized Zone is being
			searched.
			The Maquis are convinced that the
			Cardassians have found a way
			around the searches.
			We might be able to use that...
			Sir... ?
			We've come up with a plan that has
			the potential to seriously curtail
			the Maquis.
			We want to give them a target so
			threatening -- that they'd be
			willing to commit as many people
			and ships as possible to destroy
			it.
			What do you mean, give them a
			target?
			Bio-genic weapons, for example.
			You could provide the Maquis with
			intelligence that the Cardassians
			are in fact supplying their
			colonists with them.
			That'll get their attention, all
			right...
			You could tell them that in order
			to get past the check-points, the
			Cardassians are shipping the
			components for these weapons
			through third parties. We'll put
			together a convoy and send it
			toward the Demilitarized Zone.
			And when the Maquis attack it,
			Starfleet will be waiting for
			them.
			We'll station our ships in the
			Hugora Nebula to avoid detection.
			Basically, I'd be leading them
			into a trap...
			That's correct.
			If your plan works, what will
			Starfleet do when the Maquis
			attack the convoy?
			Our intention is to outnumber them
			so heavily that they'll have no
			choice but to surrender.
			These people are used to fighting
			impossible odds -- I don't think
			they're going to surrender.
			I hope you're wrong. Because if
			they don't, we'll have to try to
			disable their vessels...
			-- you know as well as I do that's
			not always possible.
			If you have a problem with any of
			this, I need to know now.
			If I did, it wouldn't stop me from
			carrying out my duty, sir.
			I knew I could count on you...
			-- it took a while, but I managed
			to patch into Starfleet's comsystem.
			I intercepted a
			communication from one of the
			check-points on the border.
			They're concerned because a Pakled
			transport came through carrying
			retro-viral vaccines.
			Why is that a concern?
			Last week, a Ferengi transport
			came through carrying bio-mimetic
			gels. By themselves, neither of
			these is dangerous. But Starfleet
			is concerned because with a few
			more components the Cardassians
			could put together a bio-genic
			device.
			What is Starfleet going to do
			about it?
			They can't do anything. These
			items are all perfectly legal.
			How close are the Cardassians to
			having the components they need?
			Very close. Two days ago, a
			Yridian convoy left Deep Space
			Nine for the Demilitarized Zone.
			It's carrying isomiotic hypos,
			plasma flares and quarantine pods.
			We can't let that convoy reach its
			destination.
			But it's too big for us to go
			after alone.
			I'll discuss the situation with
			the other cell leaders --
			considering what's at stake,
			they'll want to help.
			I've sent a communication to the
			others...
			When this is over, we'll
			celebrate.
			When it's over?
			When Cardassia realizes they can't
			intimidate us into leaving our
			colonies.
			Something tells me it might be a
			long time before we'll be
			celebrating.
			Don't be discouraged, Ro. It will
			take time... but the important
			thing is that we not give up.
			I spent ten years in the camps.
			I don't give up.
			I've been thinking about what our
			celebration will be like for a
			long time. We'll have a huge
			dinner... you'll make hasperat
			and I'll make blueberry pie...
			we'll drink wine and we'll dance.
			I'll even play the belaklavion.
			That will give everyone a laugh.
			You... play the klavion?
			Yes, badly. It's a difficult
			instrument... but I enjoy the
			challenge.
			My father... played the klavion.
			When I was very young... and
			afraid of monsters under my bed...
			my father would play for me. He
			said the sound of the klavion had
			special powers. Monsters were
			afraid of it... and they'd
			disappear whenever they heard it.
			When I listened to the music he
			played for me... I was never
			afraid to go to sleep.
			When he died... I realized... even
			he couldn't make all the monsters
			go away.
			Why wait... ? Let's go to the
			market. Let's get the food for a
			feast. For a celebration...
			A celebration of what?
			Of absolutely nothing. Just to
			celebrate.
			I'd like that.
			Macias...
			They must have found out... there
			was a Maquis cell here...
			Kalita -- get one of the med kits.
			Hurry.
			You have to hang on...
			When an old fighter like me
			dies... someone always steps
			forward to take his place...
			What is it?
			We just got a communication from
			Lieutenant Ro. Data's decoding it
			now.
			She is requesting that you meet
			with her.
			Was that part of your plan?
			No. Something must have gone
			wrong.
			Ale.
			Not tonight.
			Hello... are you alone?
			I hope not.
			Why don't we get acquainted... ?
			There's a table in the back that's
			more... private.
			I'd like that.
			We have to cancel the mission.
			Why?
			The Maquis didn't go for the bait.
			They think a convoy is too big a
			target.
			But there are only six ships. We
			could even cut down the number.
			It's... it's the commitment of
			resources... of grouping so many
			of the Maquis together at once...
			They feel it would make them too
			vulnerable.
			Every intelligence report I get
			from Starfleet suggests that the
			Maquis are eager to expand their
			strikes... are looking to escalate
			their activity... but you're
			telling me that's not true... ?
			It's... probably different in
			every cell. The people I've met
			tend to be more -- conservative.
			I'm sure others have a more
			militant attitude...
			Laren... what's going on?
			Do you have the money I asked you
			to bring?
			Yes.
			Put some on the table.
			What?
			By this time, we should be
			negotiating my price.
			When you sent me on this mission,
			I thought I could do it. Even
			though it meant helping
			Cardassians. Even though it meant
			betraying people who were fighting
			them.
			But now... I'm not sure about
			where I stand.
			Laren, are you telling me you want
			to back out of this mission?
			Sir, I don't want to let you down,
			I swear I don't --
			This has nothing to do with me --
			it's about you. If you back out
			now, you'll be throwing away
			everything you've worked for.
			Wouldn't it be better to postpone
			this operation... let me stay with
			them longer, meet other Maquis
			leaders... learn where their cells
			are... it seems to me I could be
			more valuable if I had more
			time...
			And just prolong the inevitable?
			No.
			We're committed to this mission.
			My only question to you is -- can
			you carry out your orders?
			Lieutenant... I could put you
			before a board of inquiry for
			having lied to me about this
			operation. I could certainly have
			you court martialed if you
			sabotage it.
			But I don't want to have to
			threaten you to do this... I want
			you to make the decision.
			I'll carry out my orders, sir.
			I feel it necessary to have
			Commander Riker return with you.
			He can pose as a relative.
			To make sure nothing happens that
			might obstruct this mission.
			Sorry -- I don't have that kind of
			money.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. We
			have received word from Commander
			Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the
			Maquis will be attacking the
			convoy as planned... our ships
			have taken up position in the
			Hugora Nebula to wait for them.
			I have established a relay-link
			with the sensor probe we left on
			the perimeter of the Nebula.
			This is the convoy. We are
			expecting the Maquis attack force
			to cross the border from the
			Demilitarized Zone here.
			As soon as they cross the border,
			we'll intercept them...
			In order to insure that the ship
			Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro
			are piloting does not come under
			fire, I have relayed its warp
			signature to the rest of our
			attack force.
			Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming
			into sensor range.
			Go to red alert.
			Squad leader to all ships.
			Go ahead, squad leader.
			We'll be crossing the border in
			less than one minute. Arm your
			weapons.
			Acknowledged.
			Starfleet can't make its move
			until we're out of the
			Demilitarized Zone. We're to
			break formation and take cover in
			the Nebula as soon as they appear.
			The ships in the convoy are
			raising their shields... they've
			spotted us.
			We cross the border in thirty
			seconds...
			What the --
			I'm sorry... but I can't let this
			happen.
			Sir, the vessel being piloted by
			Lieutenant Ro is firing a low-intensity
			particle beam into the
			Nebula...
			What the hell is she doing?
			The polarizing effect created by
			the beam may make it possible for
			us to be detected.
			Can you counter the effect?
			I will attempt to do so.
			Ro, why are you firing?
			Scan the Nebula -- there's a
			Starfleet attack force hiding
			inside it.
			I see them --
			Squad leader to all ships -- abort
			the mission. Repeat, abort the
			mission.
			Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking
			formation.
			Have they crossed the border?
			No, sir. They are withdrawing...
			Sir, Lieutenant Ro's ship is not
			retreating with the others...
			It is heading toward us...
			When she comes aboard... take her
			into custody...
			Alpha Seven to Alpha Nine.
			Go ahead.
			Stand by to beam me aboard.
			Standing by.
			You can take this ship back to the
			Enterprise.
			You're going with them?
			Yes... it's been a long time since
			I felt like I really belonged
			somewhere.
			Could you tell Captain Picard
			something for me?
			Tell him... that I'm sorry.
			So long, Ro. Take care of
			yourself.
			Good-bye.
			Energize.
			She seemed... very sure that she
			was making the right choice.
			I think her only real regret...
			was that she let you down.
			She let us all down...
			Here's my report...
