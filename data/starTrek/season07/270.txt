			We are losing containment in the
			starboard nacelle tube --
			Try to get more power to the field
			coils.
			Yes, sir.
			Geordi, report.
			I can't shut down the plasma
			injectors -- someone's locked out
			the controls.
			The plasma venting system has
			engaged.
			Two more decks --
			Riker to Bridge -- we've almost
			reached the nacelle tube.
			Acknowledged.
			Release the exterior hull plate.
			We may have to jettison the core.
			What happened?
			He locked out the controls...
			before we knew what was happening,
			he stepped up onto the walkway.
			See if you can shut down the
			plasma flow.
			I'm afraid if we try to get any
			closer, he'll jump through the
			forecefield.
			Dan...
			It's me... Wil Riker.
			I was here yesterday, remember?
			I didn't... want to do it...
			but... I saw them... and... they
			laughed at me... they laughed...
			Whatever happened, we can talk
			about it. I want to help.
			Stay away!
			I want you to be able to see me,
			that's all... so we can talk.
			I... know... what I have to do...
			Dan, wait --
			I have unlocked the controls --
			Shut down procedure initiated.
			There's still plasma in the
			injector -- it'll take time to
			vent off...
			Tell me what happened. Maybe I
			can help.
			I know what I have to do...
			A few more seconds and we could've
			saved his life...
			Commander... you did everything
			you could. It was not your fault.
			I had the strangest feeling
			that... he didn't even recognize
			me -- and I was with him just the
			other day when I supervised the
			tube refit.
			How did he seem then?
			Fine. In fact I complimented him
			for getting the refit done faster
			than expected. He was pleased
			that I noticed.
			I met with him during crew
			evaluations about six weeks ago.
			He was very positive; he was
			looking forward to being posted to
			the nacelle tube.
			He was a fine officer, with a good
			career ahead of him. I just don't
			understand why he would want to...
			In my years as a Starship Captain,
			I've had to notify many families
			that they'd lost a loved one. But
			never to suicide. I'd like to be
			able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's
			family some explanation for what
			happened -- to help them make
			sense of it.
			He may have left a message of some
			kind, explaining why he did it.
			I want the two of you to try and
			piece together a picture of his
			last few days.
			If he made any personal logs, it
			might be helpful to go through
			them.
			You're authorized to do so.
			La Forge to Captain.
			Go ahead.
			I've completed a damage
			assessment. We should be able to
			get underway within the hour.
			Geordi, the medical situation on
			Barson Two has worsened --
			Starfleet has given us permission
			to exceed warp speed limitations
			so we can get back on schedule.
			We'll be able to give you warp
			eight if you need it.
			Acknowledged.
			Geordi, would you agree that the
			instinct for self-preservation is
			shared by most life forms?
			I'd say it's probably the most
			basic instinct.
			That being the case, I am having
			difficulty understanding why
			someone would deliberately
			terminate their own existence.
			I don't know, Data. All I can
			think is that maybe Lieutenant
			Kwan felt like there was
			something... wrong in his life,
			something he felt powerless to
			fix.
			I believe I understand. I have
			been in a similar situation.
			Really?
			The first months following my
			activation were a difficult period
			for me... there were many
			problems associated with my
			becoming sentient.
			Because your neural net was still
			forming.
			As I acquired new skills, neural
			pathways would form and take the
			place of other, less complex
			pathways. It was very...
			disorienting.
			Sure sounds like it.
			As my systems grew in complexity,
			it became increasingly difficult
			to integrate new pathways into my
			existing neural net. The
			probability of cascade failure
			grew with each added pathway. I
			came to the conclusion that it
			would be easier and safer to shut
			myself down and start again.
			But if you did that, you wouldn't
			have remembered any of the things
			that had happened to you.
			In a way, it would have been
			like... committing suicide.
			So what did you do?
			I decided against the procedure.
			I chose instead to treat the
			problems I was having with my
			systems as... challenges to be
			overcome, instead of obstacles to
			be avoided.
			That's a great way of looking at
			it. It's too bad Lieutenant Kwan
			wasn't able to look at his
			problems the same way.
			I've gone over Kwan's personnel
			records -- he had an exceptionally
			stable psychological profile.
			When we were in the control room,
			it seemed as if he were trying
			to... explain something he'd
			done... something terrible.
			He'd been on the Enterprise over
			two years. No one has ever
			reported an altercation with him.
			These were his quarters.
			This is a Napean design...
			His mother is Napean; his father's
			human.
			Everything looks so... normal.
			For some reason I was half
			expecting to find the place a
			mess.
			Yes... it is strange to think that
			someone could be considering
			ending his life and yet not give
			any outward sign of it.
			Right before he jumped, he seemed
			almost... calm.
			He must have been in a lot of pain
			to do what he did. It could be
			that the prospect of ending that
			pain felt like a great relief.
			This is Ensign... Calloway, isn't
			it?
			She is a medical technician in
			Sickbay.
			It's always hard to lose someone
			you care about... but to lose them
			like this...
			We should start going over his
			logs...
			This is his last entry; he made it
			before going on duty this morning.
			Personal log, Stardate 47622.1.
			We finally finished the nacelle
			tube refit last night. After
			pulling two double shifts in a
			row, I'm really looking forward to
			spending some time with Maddy.
			Ensign Calloway...
			That doesn't sound like a man
			planning on ending his life.
			No... it does not...
			I can't believe he's really
			gone... I keep thinking he's
			going to show up and tell me
			there's been some terrible
			misunderstanding...
			I thought you might like to know
			that in his personal logs, Dan
			talked about you a great deal. He
			loved you very much.
			If that's true... then how could
			he... leave me like this?
			That's what I'm trying to find
			out. I know it's hard to talk
			about right now... but it would be
			very helpful if you could tell me
			a few things about him.
			When was the last time you saw
			him?
			Two nights ago... we were planning
			our next shore leave together.
			Did he mention anything that
			happened recently... anything that
			might have upset him?
			No, not really... he did say
			something about work, about
			Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't
			anything serious.
			Nara... she's his superior officer
			in the nacelle tube.
			Yes. Dan sensed that she... well,
			that she felt threatened by him --
			that she thought he was after her
			position.
			Was he prone to mood swings, or
			depression?
			No... but he was very sensitive to
			other people's moods.
			What do you mean?
			Sometimes he would just... look at
			me, and know what I was feeling --
			I always loved that about him.
			Napeans are partially empathic --
			he may have inherited some of his
			mother's abilities.
			He used to tease me that when I
			met her, I wouldn't be able to get
			away with anything.
			Dan and I knew each other for over
			two years, but we didn't really
			get together until a few months
			ago. We took it slow...
			We thought we had all the time in
			the world...
			Something must've happened to him,
			Counselor. Something terrible
			Because it's not like Dan to take
			his own life. Please... find out
			what it was.
			I'm sorry --
			I didn't see you there...
			You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't
			you?
			Can I do something for you,
			Counselor?
			I'm investigating Lieutenant
			Kwan's death. I just wanted to
			take a look around.
			It's such a shame. He was a good
			man.
			Did you notice any change in his
			behavior recently?
			No... I've been going over the
			last few days in my mind, trying
			to see if I missed any... warning
			signs. It's as if something in
			him just... snapped.
			How was his job performance?
			Excellent. He knew this ship
			better than most people --
			probably because he helped build
			it back at Utopia Planitia.
			Did he get along with his coworkers?
			He was... ambitious. He came in
			here with all sorts of new ideas
			about how to do things -- some of
			them very good ideas.
			But not all?
			No. But once he settled in, we
			got along fine.
			Excuse me for a minute. Feel free
			to look around.
			Where was Lieutenant Kwan's
			station?
			Right down there.
			Are you all right?
			I... don't know...
			I don't know how to describe it...
			I was suddenly overwhelmed by a
			flood of emotions -- fear, rage,
			panic.
			Whose emotions? I thought you
			said you were alone.
			I was. The sensations didn't seem
			to be coming from any one person --
			they were just there, in the room.
			I scanned the area -- I picked up
			no anomalous readings.
			How could you be getting an
			empathic impression from an empty
			room?
			I don't know...
			Could the fact that Kwan was
			partially empathic have something
			to do with it?
			What do you mean?
			I'm not sure... but the feelings
			Troi described certainly seem
			consistent with suicide.
			Could his death have left some
			sort of... empathic echo?
			I suppose it's a possibility...
			but I don't see how.
			If I went back to the nacelle
			tube, I might be able to get a
			better sense of what I
			experienced.
			I'm not sure that's a good idea --
			you're showing elevated levels of
			psilosynine.
			Psilosynine?
			A neuro-transmitter involved in
			telepathy.
			The experience overwhelmed you the
			first time. I don't think you
			should go back until the levels
			return to normal.
			How long?
			Three, maybe four hours.
			Next time I want someone with you.
			I will accompany you, Counselor.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47623.2.
			We've arrived at Starbase Three-twenty-eight
			on schedule. After
			taking aboard medical supplies, we
			will depart for Barson Two.
			-- I ran into Maddy yesterday. We
			stood in the corridor and talked
			for almost an hour... The more I
			get to know her, the more I
			realize what a remarkable woman
			she is...
			Come in.
			Hello, Worf.
			Counselor...
			Have you found anything in
			Lieutenant Kwan's logs?
			Everything I've seen indicates he
			was well-adjusted and optimistic.
			Were you able to talk with Ensign
			Trake?
			Yes... I interviewed all of Kwan's
			co-workers.
			From what I've read, Trake was his
			best friend.
			He observed nothing that indicated
			Kwan was contemplating ending his
			life. Nor did any of the others.
			It just doesn't make any sense...
			Can I get you anything?
			No, thank you.
			Yridian tea...
			I've been thinking about what
			happened to me in the nacelle
			tube... whether it was an empathic
			echo left by Kwan's death...
			In the past, have your empathic
			experiences always involved the
			physical presence of another
			person?
			All the ones I'm sure of, yes.
			What do you mean, sure of?
			Well... when I was a young girl,
			my Grandfather used to tell me
			stories by the fire... I would
			close my eyes and listen to his
			mind for hours on end...
			He told you these stories
			telepathically... ?
			My grandfather rarely spoke out
			loud... He said that was for off-worlders
			who didn't know any
			better.
			The only time I can remember his
			stories is when I go home... and
			sit by the fireplace. Sometimes
			when I'm there, alone... it's
			almost as if I can hear his voice
			in my head.
			Yes... I have sought visions in
			fire.
			I can't explain it, but it felt
			very real to me. Just like what
			happened in the nacelle tube.
			There are things we do not
			understand, yet they exist
			nonetheless.
			I keep thinking about Ensign
			Calloway... she needs to know
			what happened to Kwan -- it's the
			only way she'll ever be able to
			put his death behind her.
			This must be a very difficult time
			for her.
			Do you know what she regrets most?
			That she and Kwan didn't take full
			advantage of the time they had
			together... they knew each other
			for a long time, but they didn't
			get together until recently.
			She wishes they had acted on their
			feelings sooner... ?
			Perhaps I should let you rest.
			It's all right --
			If you will excuse me, Counselor.
			Worf...
			Commander...
			Two Til'amin froths, please.
			Lieutenant Corell seems to be
			enjoying your company.
			I'd like to think so.
			Are you... involved with her?
			I'm not sure yet.
			Why do you ask? Are you
			interested in her?
			No...
			But if I were, I would of course
			discuss the situation with you
			before proceeding further.
			I appreciate the thought, but you
			really wouldn't have to do that.
			I would never want to come between
			you and anyone you were involved
			with... or had ever been involved
			with.
			Is there... someone in particular
			you're talking about?
			No. Is there... someone in
			particular you would prefer I not
			become involved with?
			Worf... you sound like a man
			asking a friend if he can start
			dating his sister.
			No, I am merely... never mind.
			Excuse me, sir.
			Could you open this door for me?
			Yes, but only for a short time.
			After ninety seconds the plasma
			venting system will engage to
			prevent degradation of the
			forcefield.
			I just want to take a quick
			look...
			May I ask what you are looking
			for?
			I'm... not sure...
			Warning -- plasma venting system
			will engage in ninety seconds.
			No... please... don't...
			Plasma venting system will engage
			in... eighty seconds.
			Worf... ?
			Worf, where are you?
			Counselor... are you all right --
			Get me out of here...
			Do you remember anything else?
			I saw a tool crate on the floor...
			it was labeled Utopia Planitia.
			The shipyard where the Enterprise
			was built.
			Clearly this was much more than an
			empathic echo. It seems that you
			were actually seeing something
			that happened in the control room
			eight years ago.
			Everyone was looking directly at
			me. It's almost as if... I were
			seeing through someone else's
			eyes.
			Lieutenant Kwan was partially
			empathic...
			Maybe you were seeing through his
			eyes?
			It's a possibility... but I don't
			understand how it could have
			happened.
			Let's put that question aside for
			a moment and assume that by some
			unexplained phenomenon, you
			witnessed an event that may have
			involved Lieutenant Kwan.
			The faces you saw -- did you
			recognize them?
			I don't think I've ever seen the
			woman before, or the man who was
			with her. But there was someone
			else there. A man... he was
			staring at me in the most peculiar
			way. I think he had... reddish
			hair. He seemed familiar to me...
			but it's all so hazy, like trying
			to remember a dream.
			The woman seemed terrified of
			something... then you saw her
			again, laughing -- presumably at
			Lieutenant Kwan.
			What could it all mean?
			I don't know. But something
			terrible happened in that room.
			I felt it.
			Counselor... I want you to look
			over the personnel files from
			Utopia Planitia and see if you can
			identify the faces you saw.
			If only there were some way I
			could go back to the control room
			and not be overwhelmed by the
			experience -- it might help me
			remember some detail that could be
			relevant.
			I could give you an inhibitor that
			would slow your brain's production
			of psilosynine. That would
			probably suppress your empathic
			abilities enough to make the
			experience manageable.
			I'd like to try.
			Very well, Counselor.
			It'll take about sixteen hours to
			synthesize the inhibitor.
			I apologize for being late. The
			viral medicines we are
			transporting to Barson Two require
			special security measures to
			insure they are properly
			contained.
			Have you found anything?
			No... there were literally
			thousands of people involved in
			building the Enterprise.
			Perhaps if you found a way to
			narrow the search parameters.
			I think I have. The man who
			seemed familiar to me may have
			been on board the Enterprise
			during the last seven years. I've
			asked the computer to limit its
			search to personnel who've served
			at Utopia Planitia and on the
			ship.
			Ensign Salvatore... he transferred
			off the Enterprise last year.
			Lieutenant Ziff... she's in
			quantum mechanics.
			That's him.
			Lieutenant Walter Pierce...
			I remember now... he came aboard
			about six months ago. I think
			he's in Engineering.
			You were Lieutenant Kwan's
			supervisor at Utopia Planitia.
			That's right. I was sorry to hear
			what happened...
			Did you spend time in the nacelle
			control room while it was under
			construction?
			I worked all over the ship. In
			fact, I remember running a power
			conduit right behind that wall
			there.
			Were you ever in the nacelle room
			at the same time as Lieutenant
			Kwan?
			It was a long time ago... people
			were working all over the place.
			So you do not remember?
			I'm sorry, I don't.
			Do you recall if anything...
			unusual happened there?
			How do you mean?
			An altercation, perhaps. Possibly
			involving Lieutenant Kwan.
			No... nothing like that. The way
			I remember it, things went pretty
			smoothly.
			What's this all about? If you
			don't mind my asking.
			Not at all. You see, when I went
			into the nacelle room, I had an...
			empathic experience.
			We believe she may have been
			seeing some event that occurred
			there eight years ago.
			And -- I saw you there.
			Do you have any idea why that
			might be?
			I'm afraid I don't.
			Lieutenant... you're probably
			aware that I can sense whether
			someone's telling the truth.
			I've heard that.
			I'm sure, then, that if you were
			to... remember anything that might
			be relevant to our investigation,
			you'd contact me.
			Of course.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Counselor...
			The strange thing is I couldn't
			read him at all.
			But you implied that you could...
			We have played poker together many
			times. I have never known you to
			bluff.
			Well... it wouldn't be much of a
			bluff if you knew, would it?
			The fact that I couldn't read him
			suggests that he has at least some
			telepathic ability...
			But Pierce is human.
			That's what I don't understand...
			Even though I couldn't read his
			emotions, it did seem to me that
			he was... holding something back.
			Yes. I thought so as well.
			Maybe we should try to access the
			Engineering Logs from Utopia
			Planitia. We might find out more
			about him.
			There might be something in them
			about Lieutenant Kwan, as well.
			It looks like it'll take about
			half an hour for the transmission
			to be completed.
			Perhaps we should continue in the
			morning... ?
			It is late.
			Yes, you must be tired.
			A little...
			Well. I will say good night.
			Good night.
			We should get an early start
			tomorrow.
			Yes. We should.
			See you in the morning...
			Yes...
			Deanna...
			Hello...
			Breakfast is ready...
			Mmm... that sounds good...
			But it can wait...
			Why didn't we do this a long time
			ago... ?
			Crusher to Counselor Troi.
			Yes, Doctor.
			I've synthesized the inhibitor;
			you can come to Sickbay whenever
			you're ready.
			Acknowledged.
			Crusher to Lieutenant Worf.
			Worf, here.
			The medical supplies are ready to
			be taken to the cargo bay for
			transport.
			I will be there shortly.
			There... you should start feeling
			the effect immediately.
			How completely will it suppress my
			empathic abilities?
			It's hard to say for sure... I can
			raise the dosage if you find it's
			not enough.
			-- the cargo bay will be off-limits
			to all but medical
			personnel.
			Thanks for your help, sir.
			Good morning.
			Counselor...
			Data and Geordi are already in the
			nacelle room. Are you ready?
			Excuse me, sir. About the
			quarantine field in the cargo
			bay...
			Yes.
			It looks like we're going to need
			a second field generator.
			I am needed here. I will join you
			as soon as I can.
			All right...
			Counselor, you okay?
			I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to
			be working.
			Have you found anything?
			Nothing unusual.
			I don't remember seeing this
			console during my empathic
			experience. Has it been here
			since the ship was built?
			No, we installed it about two
			years ago.
			I remember seeing some sort of
			power conduit...
			Right there.
			The main ODN line runs right
			behind that panel... it lifts out
			so you can get to it.
			Kwan was working on that conduit
			the day before he died.
			Can you open it?
			Sure... it'll just take a minute.
			Lieutenant... the work Lieutenant
			Kwan was doing, was it unusual in
			any way?
			He was refitting a field coil.
			But it was probably the first time
			that particular panel's been
			opened since the ship was built.
			Let's set it down right here...
			Counselor?
			Are you all right?
			Something happened... when you
			took off the panel...
			There must be something there...
			I am picking up readings that
			indicate there is organic material
			imbedded in the wall...
			Organic material?
			You're right... let me reconfigure
			the emitter beam. We might be
			able to see what it is...
			There...
			This dosage should prevent any
			further empathic flashes.
			The bone fragments are definitely
			human... I sequenced a DNA sample;
			I'll see if I can match it to
			Starfleet records.
			I'd say these fragments had been
			in the wall about seven or eight
			years.
			You said something happened when
			the panel was opened...
			Yes...
			I wonder if the fragments
			themselves could've somehow
			triggered your experience. I'll
			run a resonance scan, see if
			anything turns up.
			Sir, I think we've found a
			match...
			Apparently the remains are those
			of an Ensign Marla Finn --
			I'm trying to find a picture of
			her in the records...
			That's her. That's the woman I
			saw.
			She was reported missing from
			Utopia Planitia on Stardate
			40987.2. Eight years ago...
			How could her body have ended up
			embedded inside a bulkhead... ?
			Maybe there was some kind of...
			accident.
			Or she was killed. And the
			murderer hid her remains.
			Something's not right... pull up
			Lieutenant Kwan's service record.
			I thought so... he didn't arrive
			at the shipyard until six months
			after Finn's death.
			I couldn't have been seeing
			through his eyes...
			Then whose... ?
			It had to have been someone who
			was at least partially telepathic.
			Pierce... ?
			But you saw him there.
			Yes, but not as clearly as I saw
			everything else... his face
			looked...
			Like that.
			A reflection...
			I was seeing through his eyes.
			And Finn was trying to get away
			from him; she was afraid of him...
			I think it is time we had
			another... conversation with
			Lieutenant Pierce.
			Ensign Calloway...
			Thank you for your help.
			Deck ten.
			Worf... I want to ask you
			something...
			Do you regret what happened last
			night?
			No... of course not.
			Are you sure? Because I don't
			want anything to jeopardize our
			friendship.
			Deanna... I do not regret being
			with you.
			Is something wrong?
			I just... don't feel myself.
			Maybe it's the inhibitor -- I'm so
			used to sensing what people are
			feeling... now I can't.
			Perhaps I should talk to
			Lieutenant Pierce alone.
			That might be a good idea...
			I will meet you in your quarters.
			I'll be waiting for you...
			Deck eight.
			Come in.
			Security to Counselor Troi's
			quarters.
			Acknowledged.
			I don't understand... Lieutenant
			Worf said you wanted to talk to me
			about something.
			Where is he?
			He said he had to go somewhere.
			Troi to Worf.
			Computer...
			Where is Lieutenant Worf?
			Lieutenant Worf is in Ensign
			Calloway's quarters.
			Take Lieutenant Pierce to his
			quarters and hold him there.
			Security override, authorization
			Troi Delta-two-nine.
			Worf...
			Stop it --
			Stop it --
			He's dead... you killed him...
			No... no...
			You know what you have to do...
			I know... what I have to do...
			Plasma venting system will engage
			in... seventy seconds.
			What were you doing?
			You're alive... you're all
			right...
			-- I opened the maintenance door
			at Counselor Troi's request, then
			turned and saw that she had moved
			too close to the force-field.
			It all seemed so real to me. It's
			hard to imagine that everything I
			experienced happened in just those
			few seconds...
			It appears that you were correct,
			Counselor. Lieutenant Pierce was
			partially telepathic -- his
			maternal grandmother was from
			Betazed.
			What else have you found?
			According to Starfleet records,
			Pierce and the other two persons
			Counselor Troi identified were
			killed in an accidental plasma
			discharge eight years ago. Their
			bodies were never found.
			I don't believe it was an
			accident. I think that Pierce
			found out that the other two were
			having an affair. He lost
			control... and killed them both.
			Afterwards, he probably activated
			the plasma stream, then threw
			himself into it.
			The plasma discharge would have
			obliterated any evidence that it
			was murder.
			I scanned behind the panel
			Counselor Troi asked me to look
			at. I didn't find any bone
			fragments... but I did find traces
			of cellular residue. It's showing
			some kind of... empathic
			signature.
			It may be that when Lieutenant
			Pierce was struck by the plasma
			stream, the subspace energy
			present there imprinted his
			empathic pattern into the residue.
			Kind of like a... psychic
			photograph.
			That's what triggered my
			hallucination... My mind must
			have taken elements from my own
