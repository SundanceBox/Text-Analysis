			Captain's Log, Stardate 47410.2.
			The Atrean government has
			requested assistance in averting
			a natural disaster that is
			threatening their world. Two of
			their geologists have come aboard
			to discuss the problem, one of
			whom is a human who has been
			living on Atrea Four.
			Captain, our situation has
			worsened since my husband and I
			first contacted you. The molten
			core of our planet is not just
			cooling -- it's begun to solidify.
			Our gravitational field has been
			affected -- seismic activity has
			increased by a factor of three.
			If the cooling continues at this
			rate -- Atrea will become
			uninhabitable within thirteen
			months.
			We could minimize seismic activity
			by creating isobaric fissures and
			releasing some of the tectonic
			stress -- but that would just be
			a temporary fix.
			The only permanent solution would
			be to re-liquefy the core.
			These pockets in the magma layer --
			how close are they to the molten
			region of the core?
			A few kilometers, why?
			You think that's close enough to
			try ferro-plasmic infusion?
			The procedure would involve using
			our ship's phasers to drill down
			through the planet's surface and
			into the pockets -- where we would
			set up a series of plasma infusion
			units.
			We'd trigger the units by firing
			a modulated energy burst down
			through the shafts.
			I see... injecting sufficient
			plasma directly into the core
			should trigger a chain reaction...
			and that will reliquify the
			magma...
			It should be possible to stabilize
			the core temperature at ninety-three
			percent of normal.
			If it works, the core would remain
			molten for centuries.
			If you give your permission, we'll
			begin immediately.
			Very well. But before we proceed,
			I'd like to update our geological
			surveys.
			I'll be glad to help you, Doctor.
			I've assigned you quarters during
			the time we're here. Please make
			yourselves comfortable.
			Thank you, Captain.
			Data --
			Yes, Doctor?
			Do you have any idea who I am?
			You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.
			You lost all your early memories.
			We thought you would -- but we
			couldn't know for certain.
			Have we met before?
			Oh, Data, I was there -- right
			from the beginning, on Omicron
			Theta. I helped create you.
			And now... look at you.
			You were a colleague of Doctor
			Soong?
			Yes, I certainly was -- and I was
			also his wife. In a way, I
			suppose you could say -- I'm your
			mother.
			I still can't believe it... seeing
			you again after all these years...
			Doctor, I have no memory of you.
			There's a reason for that... we
			wiped your processors after we'd
			finished refining your
			programming.
			Why don't you tell me what you do
			remember... and then I'll fill in
			the gaps.
			My memory record begins when I was
			activated by the Starfleet
			officers who found me on the
			Omicron Theta outpost.
			After the attack by the
			Crystalline Entity --
			Yes. All of the inhabitants of
			the colony had been killed.
			But -- I discovered that my memory
			banks contained the contents of
			their journals and logs.
			We thought you might find their
			experiences useful... after your
			childhood, we figured you needed
			all the help you could get.
			My -- childhood?
			That's what I called it. You were
			like a baby at first -- a hundred
			kilogram baby, but still...
			It took you a while to develop
			motor skills... learn how to
			process sensory information. And
			of course Noonian was never
			satisfied... he kept tinkering,
			trying to make you as human as
			possible. And then there was the
			business about hiccuping...
			Hiccuping?
			He was determined that you'd have
			periodic bouts of hiccups, but he
			couldn't get it right -- they were
			either too violent, or too
			prolonged, or not noticeable at
			all... I finally said, good
			heavens, Noonian -- nobody likes
			having hiccups. Why don't you
			just forget it? So he did.
			So you wiped my memory processors
			after this -- childhood.
			Then we deactivated you -- and
			programmed you with the colonists'
			logs. We were planning to reactivate
			you.
			But we never had the chance. The
			Crystalline Entity attacked... we
			had to leave quickly. We wanted
			to bring you with us -- but there
			was only room for two in the
			escape pod.
			Doctor, I have scanned the
			colonists' journals... there is
			only one Juliana mentioned in
			them, and her last name is
			O'Donnell.
			That's me...
			But there is no mention that my
			father was married to you.
			Because of my mother.
			She thought Noonian was an
			eccentric scientist who was too
			old for me... we decided to get
			married secretly and give her some
			time to get used to the idea of
			our being together.
			We slipped away to Mavala Four and
			got married there... a Klingon and
			a Corvallan trader were our
			witnesses...
			It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd
			hoped for, but Noonian had a way
			of making the oddest things seem
			romantic...
			My father did have an unusual way
			of looking at things...
			How would you know that?
			I encountered him once -- in the
			Terlina system.
			That's where we went -- after we
			left the outpost... I had no idea
			you'd ever met him.
			It was shortly before his death.
			He's... dead?
			Yes.
			I didn't think it would hit me
			this hard...
			We didn't exactly part on the best
			of terms...
			What do you mean?
			I realized that he loved his work
			as much as he loved me. Maybe
			more. There we were, stuck on
			that planet in the middle of a
			jungle... no one else to talk to,
			no -- no life. It just wasn't
			enough...
			That's why I left.
			Anyway, it was a long time ago.
			What's important is that we're
			together now.
			And I want to get to know you.
			This has been an interesting
			encounter, and one altogether
			unexpected. I would like to
			corroborate what you have told me
			before we proceed further.
			Excuse me, Doctor.
			I'm just about finished
			reconfiguring the phaser banks.
			We should be ready to start
			drilling in about an hour.
			Inform me when you are ready.
			What are you doing there, anyway?
			I am attempting to ascertain
			whether Doctor Tainer's story is
			true.
			Don't you believe her?
			I neither doubt nor believe her.
			I am simply attempting to verify
			her assertions.
			Well, what have you turned up so
			far?
			The Registrar's Office on Mavala
			Four cannot confirm that Doctor
			Soong was married there.
			Apparently many documents were
			lost when the government was
			overthrown.
			Then what are you looking at?
			I am checking passenger manifests
			to see if they went to Mavala
			during the period in question.
			O'Donnell, Juliana...
			Soong, Noonian -- they were both
			passengers on a transport that
			travelled from Omicron Theta to
			Mavala... and returned four days
			later.
			That sure seems to fit her story.
			Still, the fact that they went to
			Mavala does not prove they were
			married there.
			You know, Data... I almost get the
			feeling you're trying to prove
			that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling
			the truth.
			Not at all. I am merely unable to
			reconcile her story with the fact
			that my father never mentioned her
			to me.
			Well, she did leave him. Maybe
			she broke his heart. Maybe he
			just didn't want to talk about
			her...
			And let me ask you this... Doctor
			Soong created an emotion chip for
			you... didn't Lore tell you it
			also contained memories --
			memories Soong wanted you to have?
			Yes.
			It is possible that those are the
			memories of my childhood. And of
			my mother.
			And if you think about it -- why
			would she lie? Why would someone
			pretend to be your mother?
			I can think of no motive for such
			a pretense.
			I can understand why you might be
			a little disconcerted by all
			this... it came out of the
			blue... and the story doesn't fit
			neatly into your logical
			processors.
			That is true...
			But that's life, Data. Part of
			being human is learning to handle
			the unexpected... to risk new
			experiences even when they don't
			fit your preconceptions.
			I will admit that it is difficult
			for me to accept the possibility
			of a past about which I know
			nothing...
			But it is also true that I am very
			curious to learn more about it.
			Data...
			I would like to get to know you.
			Mother.
			-- I wanted to make you female,
			but your father insisted on a son.
			We argued about it endlessly,
			right up until we were ready to
			assemble you.
			How did you decide?
			Well, Noonian walked in holding
			your head in his hand and --
			innocent as you please -- said it
			was up to me. Of course he knew
			perfectly well what he was
			doing... once again, he'd made it
			in his own image -- what was I to
			say?
			Deanna Troi... is this who you're
			going to visit?
			Yes.
			Your father would be so pleased.
			Pleased?
			He was worried the sexuality
			programming he designed for you
			wouldn't work...
			You misunderstand; Counselor Troi
			is a therapist --
			Good night...
			Doctor Tainer has provided me with
			many details about my development
			that I was not aware of.
			Conversing with her was a
			fascinating experience --
			But... ?
			Her interest in me seems to be...
			limitless.
			She's your mother, Data. That's
			how parents are.
			I was a parent. I do not recall
			exhibiting excessive interest in
			Lal's behavior.
			Data, you and Lal were practically
			inseparable the entire time she
			was alive.
			Yes, but... she needed my help.
			That's how every parent feels.
			It's very hard to let your
			children go out into the world and
			fend for themselves. You can't
			help but be protective of them.
			I'm sure your mother feels the
			same way.
			If that is true... then why did
			she never attempt to contact me?
			I don't know, Data. It could have
			something to do with your parents'
			separating... you were part of a
			life she might have wanted to put
			behind her.
			But if you really want to know,
			why don't you ask her?
			We will be in position over the
			drilling site in three minutes,
			twenty-nine seconds.
			These scans indicate that the
			magma pockets where we plan to set
			up the infusion units are somewhat
			unstable.
			I'm going to monitor the density
			of the rock layers and adjust the
			strength of the particle beam as
			we go. That should minimize the
			seismic stress we generate while
			we're drilling.
			I've configured the phasers to
			create the most highly focused
			particle beam possible.
			Thank you, Geordi.
			I'm just glad to see that you have
			good manners. It wasn't easy to
			strike the right balance in your
			programming.
			At first you couldn't have cared
			less about social niceties like
			"please" and "thank you"; you
			were... downright rude, in fact.
			Data? That's hard to picture --
			But the first time we modified
			your program we overcompensated;
			it made you so obsequious your
			Father couldn't stand to be in the
			same room with you.
			That was nothing compared to the
			problems we had --
			Never mind. I don't want to
			embarrass you.
			I am incapable of embarrassment.
			Please, continue.
			One thing we didn't anticipate was
			that you thought nothing of being
			naked.
			-- some of the colonists objected
			to having an anatomically-correct
			android running around without any
			clothes on.
			We asked you to dress, but you
			felt it was unnecessary since you
			didn't need protection from the
			elements. We actually had to
			write a modesty sub-routine to get
			you to keep your clothes on.
			Bridge to Engineering.
			La Forge, here. Go ahead,
			Commander.
			We've established synchronous
			orbit over the drilling site.
			Phaser modifications are on-line,
			sir.
			My calculations indicate that the
			first phaser blast will be
			approximately nineteen seconds in
			duration.
			Acknowledged.
			Someone's checked his
			calculations, of course.
			No, but I'm sure Data knows what
			he's doing.
			Even so... he's a machine --
			shouldn't someone... check up on
			him?
			I have complete confidence in his
			ability to "check up" on himself.
			Mister Worf... ?
			Phasers are locked on target.
			Fire when ready.
			The beam has penetrated eight
			kilometers beneath the surface...
			Once it's through the crust, we'll
			boost phaser intensity by twelve
			percent.
			Standing by.
			Now...
			The mantle is less resistant than
			I thought it would be --
			We are within two kilometers of
			the magma pocket.
			Another five seconds should do it.
			We've broken through --
			Terminating beam.
			The pocket seems stable...
			I detect no increase in stress
			levels in the surrounding magma.
			Good work. I don't think we could
			have gotten in any cleaner.
			The drilling process has raised
			the temperature inside the magma
			pocket by almost three hundred
			degrees C. It will be several
			hours before it cools enough for
			us to enter.
			Data, do you have any plans right
			now?
			I do not.
			Maybe we could spend some time
			together? I'd love to see your
			quarters...
			Thank you. I have been practicing
			for a recital tomorrow evening.
			That was beautiful.
			I have been told that my playing
			is technically flawless, but it
			has never been described as
			beautiful.
			Well it was... really.
			Are you certain that you are not
			saying that because you are my
			Mother?
			I have observed that parents tend
			to exaggerate when it comes to
			their children's accomplishments.
			I suppose there is a certain
			amount of vanity involved...
			considering that giving you a
			creative capacity was my idea.
			Your Father didn't really see the
			point... he thought that since you
			didn't have emotions, you would
			have no need to express yourself.
			Somehow... I had the feeling the
			opposite would be true.
			I do not know for certain... but
			I believe that it is during my
			creative endeavors that I come
			closest to experiencing what it
			might be like to be human.
			Well... I'm glad I insisted.
			As am I.
			You know, Data... I'm very
			familiar with that Handel piece.
			How would you feel about my
			playing the viola part tomorrow?
			I would like that very much.
			We should practice -- do you
			happen to have a viola?
			I can replicate one for you.
			Did you paint these?
			Yes.
			I am attempting to master all
			known styles of painting.
			This one is in the style of the
			early French impressionists...
			It's very good.
			Who's this?
			That is Lal, my daughter.
			Your daughter... ?
			Yes. I created her... using
			myself as a model.
			Where is she now?
			The positronic matrix I designed
			for her was unstable. She only
			lived a short time.
			I see...
			In a sense, you were her
			grandmother...
			Would you like to practice now?
			The acoustics in Ten Forward are
			quite favorable.
			Yes... very nice...
			Data... can I ask you something?
			Of course.
			Do you think you'll ever try to
			create an android again?
			Perhaps. I created Lal because I
			wished to procreate. Despite what
			happened to her, I still have that
			wish.
			But... how do you know the same
			thing won't happen? Creating a
			stable positronic matrix is very
			tricky -- your Father lost several
			prototypes before Lore.
			I was not aware that he created
			any androids before my brother.
			There were three of them... they
			were like children to us... losing
			them was very painful. When
			Noonian decided to try again, I
			was very much against it. I
			didn't think we had the right to
			bring a life into the world that
			had so little chance of surviving.
			But your Father was sure he'd
			figured out what went wrong,
			insisted he could make a stable
			matrix. And he did.
			But Lore was cruel... evil.
			Eventually, we had no choice... we
			had to dismantle him.
			Your father decided to build yet
			another android, one who didn't
			have emotions -- I couldn't
			believe he was going to try again.
			After everything that'd
			happened...
			Mother... I am that android. Are
			you saying that you were against
			my creation?
			Initially I was. But I was wrong;
			I know that now.
			I've followed your progress for
			years -- I'm very proud of what
			you've accomplished.
			Then... why did you never attempt
			to contact me?
			Because... I was ashamed... of
			something I'd done...
			What?
			I never wanted you to know this...
			I've felt guilty about it for
			years...
			That's something you don't have to
			worry about, do you? Guilt --
			eating away at you...
			Perhaps if you told me what has
			made you feel that way, your guilt
			might be alleviated.
			I lied when I said there wasn't
			room for you in the escape pod
			that we took from Omicron... there
			was...
			I didn't want to bring you with
			us... I was afraid that if we reactivated
			you, you'd turn out like
			Lore.
			I made Noonian leave you behind...
			We are within four kilometers of
			the magma pocket...
			Doctor, should we lower the beam
			intensity?
			Yes -- yes, by sixteen percent...
			Acknowledged.
			Another twelve seconds should do
			it...
			We're getting feedback pulses
			along the particle beam --
			We must have hit a pocket of
			magnesite ore -- I'll try to
			adjust the phaser harmonics to
			compensate.
			We're going to have to terminate
			the beam if this keeps up --
			If we do, we will have to begin a
			new shaft at another suitable
			location --
			There is no other suitable
			location -- give me a few more
			seconds --
			Doctor, it's going to take longer
			than that to match the resonant --
			You did it --
			It was just luck... I hit the
			right frequency...
			All right, we're less than two
			kilometers from the target site --
			Stand by to terminate the beam...
			We've broken through --
			Now --
			I am detecting no signs of
			instability...
			Excellent.
			Commander, may I suggest we set up
			the infusion unit in the first
			magma pocket while we give this
			one a chance to cool.
			Data, Doctor Tainer -- we'll meet
			you in Transporter Room Two.
			Acknowledged.
			I have initialized the plasma
			induction coils.
			I'll need another minute to align
			the diverter...
			There are signs of stress in the
			surrounding magma, but the site
			should remain stable until we
			finish the plasma infusion.
			Good, we're almost done here.
			Data, Juliana told me what she
			said to you last night. She's
			been very upset...
			I don't blame you for being angry
			with her, but --
			I am incapable of anger.
			There seems to be some... tension
			between you...
			It's all right, Pran.
			I know what I told you must have
			been hard for you to hear, but I
			hope you can understand my
			reasons.
			I am not certain that I do.
			Perhaps you could clarify them for
			me?
			I'll try. What do you want to
			know?
			If I had been your biological
			offspring, would you have left me
			behind on Omicron Theta?
			Oh, Data... how can I answer that?
			Doctor Tainer, I have the
			impression that you are trying to
			spare my feelings. I assure you,
			that is not necessary.
			I just don't want you to
			misunderstand my answer.
			No, I wouldn't have left you
			behind if you'd been my biological
			child.
			Is that because you place more
			value on biological life than on
			artificial life?
			Absolutely not. I cherished every
			android your father and I created
			as if it were my own child. Even
			Lore.
			Despite the fact that he'd turned
			on us, despite everything he'd
			done... dismantling him was the
			most difficult thing I've ever had
			to do in my life. I was afraid
			that if you turned out like him...
			I'd have to dismantle you, too...
			and I couldn't bear that.
			I'm not trying to justify leaving
			you behind... but I am sorry I
			did. I hope you can believe that.
			I do. Thank you for making it
			clear to me.
			Data, I don't think I've ever
			heard you play more...
			... expressively.
			That was wonderful, Doctor.
			I enjoyed playing -- it's been a
			while.
			I see where Data gets his musical
			talents.
			I realize you're speaking
			metaphorically, of course, but
			thank you just the same.
			Well... that was quite a
			performance.
			Thank you.
			You know, Data... when I found out
			you were coming, I didn't know
			what to expect. I've never met an
			artificial life form before.
			But after meeting you, I feel a
			lot better. You... you're much
			different from how I imagined you.
			And I welcome you to our family.
			Would you excuse me? There is
			something I must do.
			Data... why do you need Doctor
			Tainer's medical records? Is
			something wrong with her?
			I am not certain. Perhaps you
			could determine that from her
			Transporter trace pattern.
			I probably could... but I don't
			ordinarily look into someone's
			medical status unless I have a
			good reason.
			Doctor... I would ask that you not
			require me to be more specific.
			But I assure you that I have a
			good reason for asking.
			All right, Data...
			Well... at first glance I don't
			see anything wrong -- except for
			some mild hypertension, which is
			perfectly normal for a woman her
			age.
			I see.
			Maybe you should tell me what her
			symptoms are.
			She has not complained of any
			discomfort.
			Then... why did you want to look
			at her medical records?
			Because... I have reason to
			believe she is not who she claims
			to be...
			Bridge to Data...
			Go ahead, Commander...
			There's been a cave-in in one of
			the magma pockets. You're needed
			in Transporter room two.
			On my way.
			Excuse me, Doctor.
			What happened?
			We were running a final check on
			the infusion unit when part of the
			wall gave way...
			It looks like the area has
			stabilized, but seismic stress is
			building up -- eventually, the
			pocket will collapse.
			How long, Geordi?
			It's hard to say... twelve hours
			at most.
			Then we have to finish configuring
			the unit and inject the plasma
			immediately.
			I'd rather not send anyone back
			down there.
			If we don't do it now, Commander,
			it could take months to find
			another suitable site. The core
			may have solidified by then.
			She's right, we have to act now.
			All right. But I want you in and
			out of there as quickly as
			possible.
			Acknowledged, Commander.
			You're hurt. I'll go.
			One of the transporter's pattern
			enhancers was thrown out of
			alignment by the seismic activity --
			I'm getting a normal power
			signature from it so you should be
			able to re-align it for the beam
			out.
			Energize.
			There will be more seismic
			activity. We must hurry.
			The shaft has not been obstructed
			by the seismic activity -- it
			should be possible to trigger the
			unit from orbit.
			The infuser's been damaged...
			we're going to have to start the
			programming sequence all over
			again...
			Priming the energy transfer
			matrix...
			Re-intializing the particle stream
			buffer...
			Riker to Data.
			Data, here. Go ahead, Commander.
			We're reading an increase in
			seismic stress levels.
			Understood. We will attempt to
			expedite our work.
			There... now we just have to align
			the diverter and --
			Data! Are you all right?
			Yes, Commander. We will be
			returning to the beam-out point
			shortly.
			That's it -- let's go.
			Can we transport without the
			pattern enhancers?
			No, we are too far below the
			surface.
			How are we going to get down
			there?
			There are no hand-holds in the
			rock face.
			We will have to jump.
			It's too far... I won't make it...
			You will --
			Basically, she's a Soong-type
			android -- except everything about
			her is designed to fool you into
			thinking she's human.
			She's got tear ducts, sweat glands --
			even veins and capillaries
			underneath her skin.
			Why does the scanner read her as
			a human?
			There's a feedback processor
			that's designed to send out a
			false bio-signal.
			It's tied in with her aging
			program -- she not only ages in
			appearance, like Data, her vital
			signs change too.
			What I can't figure out is why she
			lost consciousness. As far as I
			can see, everything's fine -- she
			should be awake.
			Check her positronic matrix --
			there may be a cascade anomaly.
			Data -- you said you knew she was
			an android... how?
			The first indication occurred when
			we were drilling. I saw her
			perform several complex
			calculations without the
			assistance of the computer.
			That could just have meant she was
			good at math --
			That is true. But it was enough
			to draw my attention. Later, I
			noticed something odd about the
			way she blinked her eyes.
			The intervals between blinks were
			governed by a Fourier Series --
			the same mathematical formula my
			father used to give my blinking
			pattern the appearance of
			randomness.
			I can't imagine anyone but you
			noticing something like that.
			Then there was our concert in Ten
			Forward.
			What about it?
			We had practiced the piece, and I
			noticed that she played it the
			same way during the performance --
			every pitch, every intonation, was
			exactly the same. Only an
			artificial life-form could have
			done that.
			Does her husband have any idea?
			I do not believe so. He is on the
			surface, to monitor the plasma
			infusion.
			That's probably just as well...
			Data, take a look at this.
			It appears to be an information
			module...
			With a holographic interface.
			Whoever you are, if you're
			watching this, you must have found
			out about Juliana.
			That is correct.
			I programmed this hologram to
			answer any questions you might
			have -- I'm Noonian Soong; I
			created her.
			I am Data.
			Data -- I hoped somehow it might
			be you... I even created a
			response program to answer your
			questions. How are you, boy?
			I am fine.
			I'm glad you got the chance to
			meet your mother.
			You refer to Doctor Tainer as my
			mother -- yet the complexity of
			her design indicates she was
			created after I was.
			You're right, but there was a real
			Juliana O'Donnell. She was my
			wife; she helped me create you.
			What happened to her?
			She was injured when the
			Crystalline Entity attacked... we
			made it to Terlina Three, but then
			she lapsed into a comatose
			state...
			When I realized nothing could be
			done for her, I built an android
			and started trying to perfect my
			synaptic scanning technique -- so
			I could transfer her memories into
			a positronic matrix. I didn't
			know if it would work, but I had
			to try. I couldn't stand the
			thought of losing the only woman
			I ever loved.
			A few days after Juliana died...
			I activated the android. She
			looked up at me... and she smiled.
			She recognized me. It had worked!
			Here was a life not two minutes
			old, and as far as she knew I was
			her husband and she'd just
			recovered from a terrible injury.
			It was incredible.
			And you never told her the truth?
			Why? There was no reason for her
			to know. I wanted her to be
			happy. I wanted us to be happy.
			And we were... for a while,
			anyway...
			What happened?
			I made a terrible mistake... I
			never really let her know how much
			I loved her...
			She left me... The real Juliana
			probably would've, too, if she'd
			lived.
			If she recovers and learns that
			she is an android --
			She doesn't have to know. I
			designed her to shut down in the
			event the truth was discovered.
			When you re-insert the chip,
			she'll wake up and remember
			nothing. All you have to do is
			make up some excuse about what
			happened to her.
			Then... you do not believe she
			should know the truth.
			The truth is that in every way
			that matters, she is Juliana
			Soong.
			I've programmed her to terminate
			after a long life. Let her live
			out the rest of her days, and die
			believing she was human. Don't
			rob her of that, son. Please.
			It seems that I must make a
			decision: to tell Doctor Tainer
			that she is an android -- or
			withhold that knowledge from her.
			And I do not know what to do.
			Why was Doctor Soong so adamant
			that she not be told?
			He seemed certain that if she
			knew, it would preclude the
			possibility of her being happy.
			And -- what do you think?
			I am not certain.
			I can understand why my father
			felt as he did -- but his wishes
			are not necessarily paramount. I
			am concerned with what would be
			best for -- my mother.
			Wouldn't she be better off knowing
			the truth? Dealing with the
			reality of her existence?
			I don't think so. She's believed
			she's human all her life. The
			truth might be devastating to her.
			I have noticed that her present
			husband seems uncomfortable with
			the fact that I am an artificial
			life-form. If he finds out about
			his wife, it may adversely affect
			their relationship.
			He doesn't have to know -- if you
			tell her, it would be up to her
			whether or not to tell him.
			Data, there might come a time in
			the future when she would find out
			anyway -- another accident, for
			example. Perhaps it would be
			easier for her to learn the truth
			from you.
			I can tell you that if I were in
			her place... I'd rather have my
			son tell me than some stranger...
			I find that I am having difficulty
			separating what would be best for
			her... from what would be best for
			me.
			What do you mean?
			If she knew she were an android,
			she and I would have something to
			share. I would no longer be alone
			in the universe.
			I know how much that would mean to
			you... but at the same time,
			telling her would rob her of the
			one thing you've wanted all your
			life -- to be human.
			It's a difficult choice.
			You must do what you think best,
			Data. We will support any
			decision you make.
			Data... what happened? The last
			thing I remember is jumping off
			that cliff...
			You were knocked unconscious by
			the fall... you broke a bone in
			your arm, but Doctor Crusher
			repaired it.
			Everything is fine, Mother.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. The
			infusion of plasma into the core
			of Atrea Four has been
			accomplished. Pran Tainer's
			projections indicate that the core
			will remain molten for several
			hundred years.
			When will I see you again?
			Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my
			next leave.
			I'd like that very much.
			Well... I'd better be going...
			Mother... I remembered something
			that I thought you should know.
			Before he died, my father told me
			that he had only one great love in
			his life... and that he regretted
			never letting her know how much he
			cared for her.
			I am certain he was referring to
			you.
			That's nice to know...
			On Atrea they have a saying...
			that a child born from parents who
			love each other will have nothing
			but goodness in his heart...
			I guess that explains you...
			Take care of yourself, son.
			Good-bye, Mother.
