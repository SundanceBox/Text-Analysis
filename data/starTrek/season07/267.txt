			Fletcher has more experience with
			propulsion systems --
			But Carstairs is better with
			people. Considering this is a
			supervisory position, I'd go with
			her.
			You're probably right...
			Didn't we just finish a Crew
			Evaluation Report?
			That was three months ago.
			Feels like three weeks. Maybe we
			should just give everyone a
			promotion and call it a night.
			What do you say... Commander?
			Fine with me... Captain.
			Why do they keep laughing? What's
			so funny about Crew Evaluations?
			Don't worry about it, Sam.
			Let's just try and have a good
			time.
			How can I have a good time when my
			career's being decided across the
			room?
			Think promotion... promotion...
			promotion...
			You can't really believe this will
			influence the outcome of your
			evaluation?
			It's a time-honored strategy,
			Taurik.
			The Vedeks of the Janalan order
			maintain a round-the-clock chant
			for the well-being of the Bajoran
			people.
			Considering the history of your
			planet, that doesn't exactly
			validate what he's doing.
			Promote me, please -- so I can
			make Lieutenant and have my own
			room.
			If you aren't happy sharing
			quarters with me, then you should
			put in for a new room assignment.
			Just in case you're not promoted.
			I've been thinking about who to
			promote to Ops --
			The new night duty officer?
			Lavelle's an obvious candidate,
			but I'm considering Ensign Sito as
			well.
			You sure about dessert?
			Yes. Don't tempt me.
			Are they working on the crew
			evaluations?
			Yep.
			Who were they talking about?
			It's not my place to say...
			Come on, Ben.
			Please.
			All right, but I'm not sure you're
			going to like it...
			Apparently... you're both up for
			the same job...
			Lock phasers on target --
			Phasers locked --
			The enemy vessel is firing.
			Helm, hard to starboard!
			Hard starboard --
			Fire phasers!
			Firing --
			Target is destroyed.
			End simulation sequence and secure
			from drill.
			Alpha shift, your response time
			was seven percent slower than
			gamma shift --
			I'd like all departments to submit
			drill evaluation reports by oh
			nine hundred hours --
			Ensign, you'll write that report.
			Yes, sir.
			Let's see if we can find a way to
			close that gap.
			What happened back there, Ensign?
			I'm sorry, sir. When we changed
			course I had to re-lock the
			phasers before I could fire.
			Next time try letting the locking
			relay float until the actual order
			to fire is given.
			They may not teach that trick at
			the Academy, but it works.
			Thank you, sir.
			Lavelle...
			Sir?
			Resume previous course and speed.
			Aye, aye sir.
			One "aye" is sufficient
			acknowledgment, Ensign.
			Helm, change course for the Argaya
			system -- maximum warp.
			Aye, sir.
			What about our rendezvous with the
			Clement?
			I've just received new orders from
			Starfleet. We'll discuss it in
			the Observation Lounge.
			Ensign Sito, you'll fill in at
			Ops.
			Yes, sir.
			The Argaya system is close to the
			Cardassian border; I wonder why
			we're going there.
			How would you like to be a spider
			under that table?
			What?
			A spider under the table --
			Is that like a fly on the wall?
			I guess so.
			You did really well during the
			drill.
			Apparently Commander Riker didn't
			think so. I swear he's got it in
			for me.
			You're imagining things.
			Oh, yeah? Then how come you're
			sitting in that chair instead of
			me?
			Maybe he figured I need more
			practice than you do.
			Excuse me, sir... do you have a
			minute?
			Sure. What is it?
			I'd like you to take a look at
			something.
			Have you been improvising again,
			Ensign?
			In a manner of speaking. I'm
			running a computer simulation to
			test a new warp-field
			configuration.
			You've got a problem right here...
			the plasma flow in the nacelles is
			out of sync.
			Actually, sir, that was done
			deliberately.
			As you can see, this configuration
			has increased overall warp-field
			integrity by seven percent.
			You're right...
			Doctor Nils Diaz has been
			experimenting with this technique
			at the Tanaline Propulsion
			Laboratory.
			I know his work, but I never heard
			anything about this...
			His findings have not been
			released yet. I was able to
			review a preliminary report when
			I was at the Academy.
			I'll look forward to reading about
			it...
			I predict that when these findings
			are made public, they will become
			a new model for warp field
			operation.
			Sounds interesting.
			With your permission, I would like
			to begin tests to see if the
			technique can be adapted to our
			warp drive.
			I don't know... There could be
			variables you didn't account for.
			I was quite thorough.
			I'm sure you were... but I'd like
			to look over your simulation
			before I authorize any tests.
			As you wish.
			If you have any other ideas for
			improving efficiency, feel free to
			run them by me.
			As a matter of fact, sir, I do --
			when would be a good time to
			discuss them?
			I'll get back to you on that...
			If you're wondering about your
			evaluation, it couldn't be better.
			Actually, I just wanted to tell
			you that Ensign Reilly's condition
			is showing improvement... but
			thank you.
			In fact, I'm recommending you for
			a promotion. How does Lieutenant
			Alyssa Ogawa sound to you?
			It sounds wonderful.
			I'll talk to Commander Riker... I
			expect it'll be official as soon
			as the current crew evaluation is
			over.
			Alyssa... I've been meaning to ask
			you -- how are things going with
			you and Lieutenant Powell?
			Fine... I think.
			You think?
			I'm sure it's nothing... but he
			seems... preoccupied lately. Last
			night he had to cancel our date.
			I see...
			I know he's been putting together
			a research proposal... he's been
			really busy with it...
			I can understand that. Sometimes
			I get so absorbed in my research
			I forget to eat.
			I just wonder...
			What?
			I've never met anyone like Andrew.
			It's as though we've known each
			other forever...
			You do seem well-suited.
			But... I know that in the
			beginning of a romance... it's
			possible to be... a little blind.
			I'm not sure exactly what you
			mean...
			Well... cancelling a date like
			that... the way he's been so
			distant lately...
			Doctor... do you think those could
			be warning signs? That he's
			losing interest?
			Alyssa... I think you may be
			overreacting.
			Maybe so...
			If I felt as strongly about
			someone as you do about Andrew --
			he'd have to do a lot more than
			cancel one date before I became
			suspicious.
			You're right...
			As soon as this research project
			is over... I'm sure things will be
			just like they were.
			Except, of course, that he'll have
			to deal with Lieutenant Ogawa.
			I only filled in at Ops for half
			an hour, but I had to degauss the
			main deflector dish, recalibrate
			the navigation grid, and use the
			internal sensors to find a lost
			puppy.
			Ops is a very different challenge
			from Tactical.
			I can't figure out why I'm even
			being considered for the
			assignment... I'm a security
			officer.
			I recommended you.
			I'll try not to let you down, sir.
			What could they be talking about?
			Have you ever considered learning
			to lip read?
			Do you think Worf's chewing her
			out?
			No, he always looks like that.
			Maybe he's giving her pointers on
			how to land the Ops position.
			Hi, Wil.
			Ben...
			You call him Wil?
			Why not?
			He's second in command of this
			ship, that's why not.
			I'm not Starfleet; I'm a civilian.
			And when he's in here, he wants to
			be treated like a civilian.
			Riker? I bet he sleeps in his
			uniform.
			You only think that because he's
			your C.O. If you got to know him --
			Right.
			He's convinced that Commander
			Riker doesn't "like" him.
			Why? Did you crash the ship into
			something?
			No. He just doesn't like me.
			He doesn't even know you.
			That's right. You should go talk
			to him.
			About what?
			Perhaps something you have in
			common?
			He likes Jazz... poker... he's
			Canadian --
			Yeah? My grandfather was from
			Canada.
			There you go.
			Hi --
			Here...
			I've got to go talk to somebody.
			Good evening, sir...
			Lavelle...
			Can I do something for you?
			No, sir. I... just came to get
			myself another drink.
			Something wrong with that one?
			Actually, I...
			What are you having?
			Trakian Ale.
			Good choice.
			I'll have one, too.
			My Grandfather was Canadian, you
			know.
			Really...
			Aren't you one, too?
			A grandfather?
			Canadian, sir. Canadian.
			No. I grew up in Alaska.
			Oh. Well... they both... get a
			lot of snow.
			Good talking to you, sir.
			We're holding position in the
			Argaya System.
			Anything?
			No, sir. I detect no vessels in
			the vicinity.
			How close are we to the Cardassian
			border?
			Less than five thousand
			kilometers.
			Sir... I am detecting an object...
			five meters in length.
			It appears to be an escape pod.
			They must have been forced to
			abandon ship.
			How far inside Cardassian space is
			it?
			Over fifty thousand kilometers.
			How the hell are we going to get
			it out of there... ?
			Sir, the pod's life-support system
			is failing.
			Notify Doctor Crusher --
			Can we get within Transporter
			range without crossing into
			Cardassian territory?
			We would need to boost the gain on
			the confinement beam by at least
			seven percent.
			Mister La Forge?
			I'm on it, sir.
			Try it now...
			The pod is still too far away...
			I'm going to try augmenting the
			frequency spread...
			Bio-readings indicate that the
			passenger is humanoid...
			Attempting life-form
			identification --
			No one asked you to do that,
			Ensign. Let's just get him aboard
			safely.
			There, that should do it...
			Confinement beam is at one hundred
			nine percent of normal.
			Transporter room -- you should be
			able to get a lock now.
			Aye, sir --
			Doctor, are you ready?
			Stand by.
			Alyssa, I'm afraid I'm going to
			have to ask you to leave.
			All right, Doctor.
			Transporter room. go ahead.
			What are you doing here?
			I'm not supposed to let anyone but
			the senior officers inside
			Sickbay.
			Do you have any idea what's going
			on?
			No. Do you?
			I better go.
			Ensign...
			Twelve hundred hours -- alpha
			shift is relieved...
			Excuse me, sir.
			If it's all right with you, I'd
			like to stay on for another shift.
			I could use the training.
			Now's not the best time.
			Yes, sir.
			Ensign, you're with me.
			Bridge.
			You're a certified pilot, aren't
			you?
			Yes, sir.
			How long have you served on the
			Enterprise?
			Seven months, sir.
			I see... I understand you've been
			recommended for the Ops position.
			Do you think you're up to it?
			I do, sir.
			I'm not so sure. Your record
			concerns me.
			Sir?
			The incident you were involved in
			at the Academy.
			With all due respect... that was
			three years ago. My record since
			then --
			I'm not certain it matters how
			long it's been. What I need to
			know is whether you would ever do
			something like that again.
			I can assure you, sir, I would
			never, never jeopardize lives by
			participating in --
			A dare-devil stunt? I should hope
			not. What concerns me more is
			that you participated in a coverup
			that impeded an official
			investigation into the death of a
			cadet.
			Sir, I know I should have told the
			truth right from the start --
			But you didn't. You went along
			with the others and pretended that
			what happened was nothing more
			than an accident. What do you
			suppose that tells me about your
			character?
			Sir, if you had any idea what it
			was like after that incident -- I
			didn't have any friends, anyone to
			talk to. I had to take my flighttest
			with the instructor because
			no one else would be my partner.
			In a lot of ways it would have
			been easier to just walk away.
			But I didn't. I stuck with it.
			Doesn't that say something about
			my character, too... ?
			I'm very sorry you didn't enjoy
			your time at the Academy, Ensign.
			But as far as I'm concerned, you
			should have been expelled for what
			you did. Quite frankly, I don't
			know how you made it onto my ship.
			You're dismissed...
			Two more seconds...
			That's enough.
			Sir, I'm a little puzzled. Why
			are we intentionally damaging this
			shuttlecraft?
			We're evaluating hull resiliency.
			Starfleet requires periodic
			testing.
			I see.
			I don't believe I'm familiar with
			that requirement.
			Probably because you're not a
			senior officer.
			If you wish, I can reconfigure the
			phaser to fire a low-intensity
			burst that would not harm the
			shuttle's hull. The test
			procedure would not be affected.
			It's fine the way it is. Just
			give me a four second burst right
			about here.
			Should I fire from this position?
			Actually...
			Make it over there.
			That would be consistent...
			Consistent with what?
			With making it appear that this
			shuttle fled an attack.
			What makes you think that's what
			we're doing?
			The pattern of fire you have asked
			for is similar to what might
			result if the shuttle were fleeing
			an attacker while engaging in
			evasive maneuvers.
			That's quite a coincidence...
			Yes, sir. It is indeed. Shall we
			proceed with the testing?
			Yes, Ensign. Thank you.
			Alyssa... thanks for coming so
			quickly.
			We need to prepare for surgery.
			We have a comatose patient with a
			subdeural hematoma.
			Yes, sir.
			I want to make it clear that you
			are not to discuss what you see
			here with anyone.
			I understand.
			We'll need to synthesize at least
			a liter of Cardassian blood...
			What I can't figure out is why
			we're just sitting here so close
			to the Cardassian border.
			It must have something to do with
			that escape pod we picked up.
			Don't you think?
			Maybe...
			I wonder who was in it... ?
			You know what I heard... ?
			It was Ambassador Spock.
			That is unlikely.
			That's what I was told...
			By whom?
			I can't say.
			They beamed whoever was in it
			right to Sickbay.
			Did you see anything when you went
			down there?
			No... Doctor Crusher just wanted
			me to help her with the lab
			schedule.
			I thought Lieutenant Powell was
			going to join us tonight?
			He had to do a double shift.
			That's too bad...
			He's the worst poker player I've
			ever met...
			It's your bet, Sam.
			Twenty.
			-- the thing is, I saw Powell in
			Ten Forward with another woman...
			the way they were talking made me
			wonder...
			He should tell Alyssa if he's
			seeing someone else. Even if it
			hurts her, it'll be better in the
			long run.
			I've been meaning to tell you
			something, Worf... I don't think
			Ensign Sito is ready for the Ops
			position.
			I must say that I disagree, sir.
			I'm listening...
			The bet is fifty --
			It would be illogical for the
			Captain to deny you a promotion
			because of something you did as a
			cadet.
			He said it shows I don't have
			character.
			What did you say?
			What could I say?
			Maybe he's right...
			You're a damn fine officer and you
			deserve that post as much as
			anyone.
			One thing's for sure -- I won't be
			getting it. Not if it's up to
			Riker.
			It is your decision, sir -- but if
			you give her a chance to prove
			herself, I feel certain that
			Ensign Sito will not disappoint
			you.
			All right, Worf. I'll keep her
			under consideration.
			Besides, I have my doubts about
			Lavelle.
			Really? Why?
			He's too... eager to please. He
			keeps trying to ingratiate himself
			to me.
			Why assume he's doing it just to
			get the job?
			I'll see your fifty and raise you
			a hundred.
			I don't know... It seems to me
			that you and Lavelle have a lot in
			common.
			What? We're not at all alike.
			You're bluffing.
			Think so?
			Yes, and I'm not gonna let you get
			away with it.
			You know, Sam, maybe you shouldn't
			try so hard with Riker. It
			doesn't matter whether he likes
			you... as long as he respects you.
			And he must... otherwise he
			wouldn't be considering you for
			the Ops position.
			You're probably right... maybe I'm
			just telling myself he hates me so
			if I don't get promoted I'll have
			an excuse.
			Well? You in or not?
			At this juncture, the odds of my
			winning this hand are less than
			thirty-nine to one. I fold.
			Looks like it's just you and me,
			buddy. You in for another fifty?
			Give me a minute. I'm thinking.
			Didn't you tell me you took up
			poker so you could get into the
			officer's game on the Potemkin?
			I happen to like poker.
			But your senior officers might
			have thought you were trying to
			ingratiate yourself -- I guess
			they realized you were just young
			and inexperienced and decided not
			to hold it against you.
			Maybe I am being too hard on
			Lavelle...
			I do not believe he is bluffing.
			I do.
			What've you got?
			I can't believe this.
			I'm your worst nightmare...
			I knew it!
			How could you tell I was bluffing?
			You don't really expect me to
			answer that, do you... ?
			Well... it's getting pretty late.
			Maybe we should all get some
			sleep.
			One more hand --
			Come on, Geordi. You're not going
			to quit just because I'm
			unbeatable?
			There's something I need to do
			down in Engineering.
			I'll get you next time.
			I'll be waiting...
			Good night, everybody.
			Good night.
			What I find curious is that when
			Commander La Forge saw that the
			technique I was proposing was more
			efficient, he seemed... annoyed.
			Of course he was.
			He didn't like the fact that you
			knew something he didn't.
			Do you think I have irreparably
			damaged my relationship with him?
			It depends on what kind of guy he
			is.
			Ante up, gentlemen.
			Come in.
			Commander --
			Don't get up. I just dropped by
			to see Taurik.
			What can I do for you, sir?
			I'm headed for Engineering to run
			those tests on the nacelles.
			Since you've already put in some
			work on the technique... I thought
			you might like to give me a hand.
			I would be pleased to, sir.
			Great. Let's go.
			How about some blackjack?
			I've got to get some sleep so I
			can be sharp tomorrow.
			Why? So you can get promoted,
			have more responsibility, and have
			to get to sleep even earlier?
			Good night...
			Come in.
			Ben --
			I just cleaned out some junior
			officers and I thought I'd do the
			same here.
			You're welcome to give it a try.
			Pull up a chair.
			Thanks --
			Ensign Sito --
			I also teach an advanced class --
			I believe you may be ready to
			participate.
			Before you can join the group,
			however, you must pass the...
			gik'tal.
			Gik'tal?
			It is a very ancient Klingon
			ritual. It tests your knowledge
			of the forms of the mok'bara.
			I should practice first...
			No. No practice. That is part of
			the ritual -- the test must be...
			unannounced.
			Come.
			Can you see?
			No...
			Ow!
			You did not anticipate.
			How am I supposed to defend myself
			when I can't see a thing?
			Stop making excuses! Replace the
			blindfold.
			No, this isn't a fair test.
			Very good, Ensign. You have
			passed the challenge.
			What? By taking off the
			blindfold?
			It takes courage to say the test
			is not fair.
			There's one thing I don't
			understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean
			"to the death"?
			You... speak Klingon?
			Sir... is there really such a
			thing as the gik'tal challenge?
			No... there is not.
			But perhaps the next time you are
			judged unfairly, you will not have
			to suffer so many bruises before
			you protest.
			-- all I've ever wanted is to make
			a career for myself in Starfleet.
			I can't change what happened at
			the Academy. No one can. All I
			can do is work hard and try to
			earn the respect of the people I
			serve with.
			If you're not going to give me
			that chance, then I respectfully
			request that you transfer me to
			another ship.
			If you're looking for a more
			lenient commander, I don't think
			you'll find one.
			Permission to speak freely, sir?
			Please do.
			If you didn't want me on your ship
			you should have said so when I was
			assigned to it.
			It's not your place to punish me
			for what I did at the Academy.
			I've worked hard here. My record
			is exemplary. If you're going to
			judge me, judge me for what I am
			now.
			All right, Ensign. I will...
			It took a lot of courage to come
			here and face me after what I said
			to you the other day.
			You see... I didn't call you in
			here then to assess your
			qualifications for the Ops
			position.
			I... don't understand.
			I was harsh with you because I was
			assessing you for a very important
			mission. A mission that could
			involve a situation far more...
			unnerving than being dressed down
			by your commanding officer.
			May I ask what this mission --
			Join the senior staff in the
			Observation Lounge at oh-nine
			hundred hours. We'll discuss it
			then.
			Yes, sir.
			And Ensign... I do know how you
			ended up on the Enterprise. I
			asked for you.
			I wanted to make sure you got a
			fair chance to redeem yourself.
			You wanted to see me, Doctor?
			Yes...
			Alyssa, I think you know how much
			I've come to depend on you. I've
			recommended your promotion because
			your performance here has been
			exemplary.
			Thank you, Doctor... I appreciate
			that.
			But more than that, I've come to
			think of you as a friend. Someone
			I care about...
			That's nice of you to say. I feel
			the same way.
			So... I was wondering about you
			and Andrew Powell...
			Someone told you!
			Told me... ?
			We were going to keep it a secret
			until the promotions are
			announced.
			Secret... ?
			He asked me to marry him.
			Alyssa -- that's wonderful!
			I'm so relieved...
			I mean -- happy.
			Have a seat, Ensign.
			This is Joret Dal... he was in the
			escape pod we retrieved.
			Joret is a member of the
			Cardassian military... he is also
			a Federation operative.
			He risked his life to come here
			and give us invaluable information
			about Cardassia's strategic
			intentions -- information that
			could very well enhance the
			security of Bajor, as well as
			other planets in this sector. It
			is imperative that we get him
			safely back to Cardassian space.
			It will not be easy. The border
			is heavily guarded.
			Since his ship was destroyed he's
			going to have to take one of our
			shuttlecraft.
			If a patrol stops me, I will claim
			to have stolen it.
			We have distressed the shuttle so
			that it appears to have been fired
			on.
			Joret's going to have to try and
			talk his way past the patrol.
			If I were alone, the chances of my
			succeeding would be slim. But if
			I had a prisoner with me... a
			Bajoran terrorist...
			I would appear to be a bounty
			hunter. Border crossings of that
			nature are not uncommon... for a
			price, the patrol can be convinced
			to look the other way.
			Once the shuttle is safely past
			the patrol, Joret will put you in
			an escape pod and send you back
			across the border.
			Since the pod is so small, it
			shouldn't be detectable.
			We'll be waiting here to pick you
			up.
			I understand, sir.
			This is obviously a very dangerous
			mission. I'm not ordering you to
			take part in it.
			Then I'll volunteer, sir.
			Be certain you understand the risk
			you are taking. If you are
			captured --
			I'm Bajoran. No one knows better
			than I do what the Cardassians do
			to their prisoners.
			I've made my decision.
			Very well, Ensign. Report to
			Sickbay.
			Doctor Crusher will explain.
			I'd also ask you not to discuss
			this mission with anyone...
			Yes, sir.
			I didn't realize she would be
			so... young...
			The Captain asked Doctor Crusher
			to make it look like Joret had
			mistreated me...
			We're all set...
			Sir... I want you to know that I
			really appreciate the fact that
			you've always had confidence in
			me.
			Good luck...
			I'll see you soon...
			We are approaching the border...
			it won't be long before we're
			detected by the patrol ships.
			When they stop us... do you want
			me to say anything?
			No. It should seem that I've
			broken your will. If you're asked
			any questions, look at me... as
			though you're afraid to answer.
			Can I ask you something... ? Why
			are you doing this -- risking your
			life to help Starfleet?
			I don't consider myself a traitor,
			if that's what you're asking.
			I've served in the military all my
			life... once it was an institution
			dedicated to the security of
			Cardassia, now it's little more
			than... a platform for ambitious
			Guls hoping to make their
			reputations in battle.
			If the information I provide helps
			Starfleet deter even one pointless
			border skirmish, I'll have served
			my purpose. I'm sick of war. My
			people need peace.
			I never thought I'd hear a
			Cardassian say something like
			that...
			And I never thought a Bajoran
			would risk her life to help a
			Cardassian get home...
			A patrol ship is closing in on our
			position...
			We don't have much time...
			She must have left on that
			shuttle, there's no other
			explanation.
			Do you have any idea where it
			went?
			Toward Cardassian space -- that's
			what I'm worried about.
			There's another thing, I noticed
			the shuttle was damaged --
			Sam, can we talk about something
			else?
			Don't you care what's happened to
			her?
			Of course --
			But we have to accept the fact
			that we're not always told about
			everything that happens aboard
			ship.
			We can at least tell each other
			what we know.
			Do you two know something?
			Sam, please...
			I can't believe this. We're
			friends.
			We're also Starfleet Officers.
			I'm not allowed to talk about
			it...
			Okay... I understand.
			I better get going... I'm on duty
			in half an hour...
			Report.
			We've completed a long-range scan
			of the area, sir. The escape pod
			doesn't seem to be out there.
			It is possible that at this
			distance we are simply unable to
			distinguish the pod from the
			inorganic matter normally present
			in space.
			Try narrowing the scan field --
			see if you can pick up any biosigns.
			Sir... it would help if I knew
			what kind of life-signs to look
			for.
			You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns,
			Ensign.
			Yes, sir.
			Nothing yet, sir. The pod's
			thirty-two hours overdue.
			Sir, I recommend we launch a probe
			to increase the range of our
			sensor sweeps.
			Sending a probe into Cardassian
			space would be a treaty violation.
			Prepare a probe and launch when
			ready.
			Aye, sir.
			It will be several minutes before
			we begin to receive the probe's
			telemetry.
			Sir... I am detecting signs of
			debris two hundred thousand
			kilometers inside Cardassian
			space...
			Its mass and composition indicate
			that it could be the remains of a
			Federation escape pod...
			Captain's Log, supplemental. We
			have intercepted a Cardassian
			report stating that a Bajoran
			prisoner escaped her captor... and
			was killed in an evacuation pod as
			she tried to leave Cardassian
			space...
			To all personnel with security
			clearance J-one and higher... this
			is the Captain. It is my sad duty
			to inform you --
			-- that a member of the crew...
			Ensign Sito Jaxa...
			Has been lost in the line of
			duty...
			She was the finest example of a
			Starfleet officer... a young woman
			of remarkable courage... and
			strength of character.
			Her absense will be deeply felt by
			all who knew her...
			You okay... ?
			Hi...
			I just got promoted...
			Congratulations...
			Thanks...
			I just don't feel right about
			it... for all I know, she was
			going to get the promotion instead
			of me.
			You shouldn't feel that way, Sam.
			She would have been happy for you.
			The best way to remember her...
			would be to excel in your new
			position.
			We're proud of you, Sam.
			Excuse me, sir... but I need to
			move this table.
			What?
			There's an empty seat over there.
			I appreciate what you are trying
			to do, but it is not...
			appropriate. You were her
			friends. I was only her
			commanding officer...
			Sir... I happen to know that she
			considered you a friend.
