			Personal log, Stardate 47391.2.
			I am returning from the Bat'leth
			competition on Forcas Three. The
			conditions were difficult...
			several contenders were maimed.
			But I was triumphant...
			I won "Champion Standing."
			I look forward to resuming my
			duties aboard the Enterprise.
			However, I am anticipating a...
			troubling situation.
			It looks like we're going to have
			to head out to the Argus Array.
			This is the third time in the last
			year it's stopped relaying data.
			Starfleet's beginning to think it
			may be more than a simple
			malfunction.
			I want you to start a long range
			scan as soon as we enter the --
			Are you listening to me,
			Lieutenant?
			Oh... yes, sir.
			You seem pretty tense for a man
			who just came back from vacation.
			Today... is my birthday.
			What's the matter with you?
			Because it is my birthday... I
			assumed that you or one of the
			others would try to mount an
			unexpected... social gathering.
			You mean a surprise party? Worf,
			I hate surprise parties. I would
			never do that to you.
			I am... sorry, Commander.
			Why don't you settle in and I'll
			meet you on the Bridge.
			Aye sir.
			SURPRISE!!
			Actually, Worf, I love surprise
			parties.
			"Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah lo
			Pre'tOk... Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah
			lo Pre'tOk... Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah
			lo Pre'tO-O-O-O-Ok... Tu Mak
			Dagh Cha doh Borak!"
			That was not a Klingon song.
			It wasn't easy to translate.
			There doesn't seem to be a Klingon
			word for "jolly".
			It's traditional for the birthday
			boy to cut the cake.
			Captain Picard sends his birthday
			wishes. He was needed on the
			Bridge.
			Happy birthday, Worf.
			Thank you....
			Ah... a painting.
			Yes. I have entered my Abstract
			Expressionistic phase. This is my
			interpretation of the Battle of
			HarOS.
			The Battle of HarOS... ?
			I think it's wonderful. And I
			know just where to hang it...
			What are you doing?
			I always thought this room could
			use a little more color.
			Battle of HarOS, right?
			You alright?
			I believe Commander Data's
			painting is making me dizzy...
			I thought this cake was
			chocolate...
			Don't I wish.
			This is from Alexander. He gave
			it to me before he left to visit
			your parents.
			What is it?
			Alexander's forehead.
			The ridges of a warrior.
			He really wished he could've been
			here when you got back from shore
			leave. You should have seen him,
			Worf... he stayed up all night
			talking about how proud he was of
			his father.
			Thank you for watching him while
			I was away.
			It was my pleasure.
			So... how old are you, Mister
			Worf?
			Captain -- I was told you couldn't
			attend.
			I wouldn't miss this for the
			world. How old are you?
			I am... old enough.
			Report.
			The Array appears to be
			functioning normally, sir.
			That can't be right. We were told
			it stopped relaying data six days
			ago.
			The Array is still transmitting
			data. However, it is no longer
			sending that information to the
			Federation.
			It appears that someone has
			redirected its imaging systems.
			Where is the information being
			sent now?
			Sector One-nine-six-five-eight.
			I am unable to access the Array's
			main computer, so it is impossible
			to determine the exact location.
			What's in that sector?
			It is uninhabited. But there
			could easily be a ship, or a
			subspace relay station receiving
			the data.
			Captain. I suggest we beam a
			repair crew aboard the Array. We
			can download the imaging logs --
			find out what the Array's been
			observing for the past six days.
			Make it so.
			Excuse me, Counselor. Do you have
			a moment?
			Of course.
			I have been meaning to speak with
			you... about Alexander.
			Oh?
			It has never been easy for me...
			having Alexander on board. I have
			always tried to be a good
			father... to give him guidance...
			but he seems to have his own mind
			about some things.
			Most children do.
			I could not have gotten this far
			without your help. Alexander
			looks up to you. At times, I have
			felt that you are like a mother to
			him.
			Worf... that's one of the nicest
			things anyone's ever said to me.
			Once, when I thought I was going
			to die... I asked you to watch
			over Alexander. I was
			wondering... if you might consider
			formalizing that arrangement.
			I want you to be Alexander's SohchIm.
			His "Soh-chIm"?
			You would become his surrogate
			mother. In case anything ever
			happened to me, you would be
			responsible for him.
			Worf, I don't know what to say.
			It's a great honor.
			So this would make me your...
			The closest analogy would be...
			step-sister.
			That would make my mother your
			step-mother.
			I had not considered that...
			It is a risk I am willing to take.
			I accept.
			Lieutenant Worf, please report to
			Engineering.
			On my way.
			We have analyzed the imaging logs.
			It appears that the Array was
			reprogrammed to observe several
			Federation sites.
			This is Deep Space Five...
			Starbase Forty-seven... the Iadara
			Colony... and this is the Utopia
			Planitia Shipyard.
			The Utopia Planitia shipyard...
			they're responsible for new
			starship development...
			Someone is using the Array for
			covert surveillance of the
			Federation.
			That is our theory. We believe
			that unauthorized access was made
			six days ago. The imaging logs
			from that day show a ship
			approaching the Array...
			That's a Cardassian ship. Galor
			Class.
			We're only three light years from
			Cardassian space. They would've
			had easy access to the Array.
			Mister Worf, start a long range
			scan of the region... see if there
			are any Cardassian ships nearby.
			Aye sir.
			Here's a propulsion analysis of
			the Cardassian ship. You might
			try scanning for its energy
			configuration.
			Are you alright, Lieutenant?
			I feel... dizzy...
			Worf, you don't look so good.
			Maybe you should go to Sickbay...
			Yes... perhaps I will.
			Any nausea... or blurred vision?
			No. However, I did experience
			dizziness earlier today... at my
			birthday celebration.
			It sounds like you're having a few
			side-effects from the concussion.
			I'll give you vertazine for the
			dizziness... but I want you to get
			some rest.
			Doctor... perhaps you are thinking
			of another patient. I have no
			concussion.
			Worf... you came in here this
			morning complaining about a
			ringing in your ears. I scanned
			you... you had a concussion.
			Are you telling me you don't
			remember any of this?
			No...
			Temporary memory loss is common
			with this kind of injury...
			Do you remember telling me about
			the Bat'leth tournament? You said
			one of the competitors hit you in
			the head... that's why you lost
			the match...
			I won that tournament. I can
			prove it to you.
			What's wrong?
			It says... "Ninth Place."
			This is not the same trophy...
			Someone is playing a trick on me.
			Worf, try to calm down. Memory
			loss can be very disorienting...
			The log... I recorded a personal
			log on my way back to the
			Enterprise.
			Computer -- access personal logs
			on Shuttlecraft Curie. Show my
			log entry for Stardate 47391.2.
			Personal log, Stardate 47391.2.
			I am returning from the Bat'leth
			competition on Forcas Three. The
			conditions were difficult...
			several contenders were maimed.
			One of the contenders used an
			illegal T'gha maneuver against me.
			The judges chose to ignore it...
			and I was robbed of my rightful
			standing.
			I was awarded "Ninth Place".
			I look forward to resuming my
			duties aboard the Enterprise.
			However, I am --
			I do not understand...
			I'm sure this must be very
			disturbing for you... but don't
			worry. Your memories will
			eventually return to normal.
			The best thing you can do right
			now is settle back into your
			normal routine... but slowly.
			Thank you, Doctor.
			If you have any more problems with
			dizziness, let me know.
			Lieutenant, have you completed the
			metallurgical scan of the Array?
			Sir?
			The metallurgical scan. Is it
			complete?
			I do not remember you asking me to --
			Captain. There is a Cardassian
			ship approaching. Galor Class.
			Open a channel.
			On screen.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the Starship Enterprise. You are
			in Federation territory. Please
			explain your presence here.
			We were wondering the same thing
			about you, Captain. Why would
			Starfleet's flagship want to
			venture so close to the Cardassian
			border?
			We are repairing one of our
			subspace telescopes.
			I see. May we offer our
			assistance?
			No, thank you. We have everything
			under control.
			If you don't mind my asking...
			what exactly is this telescope of
			yours designed to do?
			It's a long range subspace
			Array... it gathers data on
			astronomical phenomena.
			I'm certain it would never be used
			to... "observe" a neighboring
			species.
			Certainly not.
			Well, then... best of luck with
			your repairs.
			Just try to make certain that your
			studies are limited to...
			"astronomical phenomena".
			Charming fellow.
			Captain -- that ship was
			responsible for reprogramming the
			Array.
			What do you mean?
			It is the same Class and energy
			configuration as the ship we saw
			in the imaging logs.
			Imaging logs... Are you saying you
			have evidence that the Cardassians
			tampered with the Array?
			They have been using the Array as
			a surveillance device.
			You saw the logs yourself.
			I haven't heard anything about
			this.
			Neither have I.
			Commander Data -- show them the
			imaging logs you downloaded from
			the Array.
			I know of no such logs,
			Lieutenant.
			Worf... are you feeling alright?
			Yes.
			Mister Data, perhaps you should re-examine
			the Array... see if you
			can find anything to support
			Worf's claims.
			In the meantime, Lieutenant... I
			think you should go to your
			quarters.
			Doctor Crusher says I am
			experiencing further memory
			loss... but my instincts tell me
			it is more than that...
			I remember those imaging logs...
			I could tell you every detail...
			every word...
			Worf, let's assume you're right
			for a second -- that things did
			happen as you remember them.
			Are you saying that everyone's
			memory on this ship has been
			altered but yours?
			The only one of us who's had a
			recent head injury or mental
			stress is you. Isn't it more
			logical that your concussion is
			causing some memory problems?
			Enter.
			Hi, Worf. I wanted you to know
			that we re-examined the imaging
			logs. They don't show a
			Cardassian ship... or any
			evidence that the Array was
			reprogrammed.
			From what we can tell, the Array
			suffered a simple mechanical
			failure.
			That is not right. I am certain
			that --
			What's wrong?
			The painting Commander Data gave
			me...
			It has moved.
			Worf, I hung that painting
			there... at your birthday party.
			Remember?
			No...
			The painting has changed... don't
			you see it?
			Your hair... and your clothing...
			they have changed, as well...
			Worf, maybe you should --
			Now, Mister Worf!
			Now!
			Worf, what are you waiting for?
			Raise shields.
			This panel configuration has been
			altered, sir. I do not know how
			to --
			Direct hit -- Engineering Section,
			Deck Forty-two. Shield generators
			are overloading.
			Number One.
			Firing photon torpedoes, full
			spread.
			Direct hit on their main
			reactor... they're returning
			fire!
			Captain, we have sustained heavy
			damage to our deflector systems.
			Hull breaches on Decks Seventeen
			and Thirty-six.
			Ensign, take us out of here,
			maximum warp.
			Are they pursuing?
			No, sir.
			But they're firing on the Argus
			Array...
			They've destroyed it, sir.
			Bridge to Engineering. Status,
			Mister La Forge?
			This is Ensign Hayes, sir.
			Commander La Forge has been taken
			to Sickbay with plasma burns...
			There's serious damage to the
			secondary plasma conduit... but I
			think we've got it under control.
			Acknowledged.
			Ensign, lay in a course for
			Starbase One-two-nine.
			What happened back there,
			Lieutenant?
			I believe I had another... memory
			loss.
			"Memory loss"... What are you
			talking about?
			I do not feel well, Captain.
			Request to be temporarily relieved
			of duty.
			Granted.
			Computer -- access personal logs
			on Shuttlecraft Curie. Play log
			entry for Stardate 47391.2.
			There is no log entry for that
			Stardate.
			Computer, display any log entries
			regarding the Bat'leth Tournament
			on Forcas Three.
			Personal log, Stardate 47391.2.
			There has been a malfunction in
			the ship's main deflector. It
			will require two more days of
			repairs.
			As a result, I will not be able to
			compete in the Bat'leth tournament
			on Forcas Three. I have asked my
			brother to take my place. He does
			not have my prowess with the
			blade, but --
			Why'd you lock the door?
			Why shouldn't I?
			I heard about what happened on the
			Bridge. Are you all right?
			I am not sure...
			Do you want to talk about it?
			I would rather not, Counselor.
			Very well, Lieutenant.
			Hot chocolate.
			Is there something I can do for
			you?
			Actually, there is...
			I want you to sit down. Relax for
			a minute.
			You're really tense.
			Worf... I know you don't want to
			talk about what happened on the
			Bridge... but there are times when
			it's best to open up...
			Come on... if you can't talk to
			me, who can you talk to?
			I do not believe this is
			appropriate behavior!
			Not even for your wife?
			Wife!
			Worf, what's wrong?
			I do not know... things are...
			changing...
			What's changed?
			I do not remember us... you and
			I... being mates...
			It is as if events...
			circumstances... continue to
			change from moment to moment...
			but I am the only one who seems to
			be aware of it...
			So... are you saying you don't
			remember the last three years?
			You don't remember us falling in
			love... and getting married?
			I do remember the last three
			years... but they are different.
			We did not have this relationship.
			We were friends. The Enterprise
			did not have a battle with the
			Cardassians...
			No one believes me.
			Worf... whatever's wrong...
			whatever's happened... I want you
			to know that I believe you...
			And that I love you. We'll find
			out what's happening...
			I am initiating a subspace scan to
			search for temporal anomalies on
			or off the ship.
			Counselor Troi, please report to
			Sickbay.
			On my way.
			Let me know if you find anything.
			Commander... how long have I been
			married to Counselor Troi?
			Two years, one month and twelve
			days.
			And when did this... relationship
			begin?
			It is my understanding that your
			romantic affiliation began soon
			after you recovered from your
			spinal injury on Stardate 45587.
			I remember that... A cargo
			container fell on me.
			That is correct. After that, I
			observed that you and the
			Counselor began to spend more time
			together.
			When did it become... romantic?
			It was approximately six months
			later that you asked Commander
			Riker for his formal permission to
			court Counselor Troi.
			You felt that to do otherwise
			would be dishonorable.
			And then we mated.
			I am not privy to the exact
			details of when, where and how the
			first coupling took place. I
			could investigate it if you --
			No... that is alright.
			I am detecting no temporal
			anomalies in this system.
			Perhaps we should try to pinpoint
			the exact moment when events
			became discontinuous. Do you
			remember the first change?
			I went to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
			told me I had a concussion... but
			I do not remember that happening.
			Think back. Are you sure that was
			the very first change? Perhaps
			there was one before you entered
			Sickbay?
			Before...
			Yes... yes. In Engineering. I
			felt a wave of dizziness... and
			when I looked up, you and
			Commander La Forge were on the
			opposite side of the room.
			Captain Picard was gone.
			I thought I had blacked out for a
			moment, and had not observed your
			movements.
			And at my birthday party... the
			cake was chocolate, then it was
			yellow. And Commander Riker told
			me the Captain was not going to
			attend... then suddenly the
			Captain was there.
			We should try to find any
			commonalties in these events.
			Where were you each time?
			I was at the party... then I was
			in Engineering... then in my
			quarters...
			What about the people you were
			with? Was there anyone who was
			present at all three events?
			Everyone was at my birthday
			party... then I was with
			Counselor Troi... then Commander
			La Forge entered...
			Geordi was in all three locations.
			And he was near me in each case,
			just before I noticed the
			differences.
			Do you think there is a
			connection?
			It is possible. We should speak
			with Commander La Forge.
			Doctor, is Geordi well enough to
			answer some questions?
			I'm afraid not, Data. Geordi's
			dead.
			There do not appear to be any
			unusual readings. Energy
			residuals from the plasma burns...
			the beginnings of cellular
			decomposition...
			I see nothing that connects these
			bio-readings to your recent sense
			of discontinuity.
			What about his VISOR?
			I still see nothing unusual.
			Perhaps we should activate it.
			Hook it up to the diagnostic array
			and I'll check it out.
			The VISOR is active.
			Worf... are you alright?
			Have you noticed another
			discontinuity, Commander?
			A moment ago, Doctor Crusher was
			not here. It was... Doctor Ogawa.
			Doctor Ogawa?
			And my uniform is different...
			what is my rank and position?
			You're a Commander... and First
			Officer.
			Are we still married?
			Yes...
			I am detecting a quantum flux in
			your cellular RNA...
			What does it mean?
			I do not know. I will have to
			analyze these readings...
			I have found that the quantum flux
			in Worf's cellular RNA extends to
			the subatomic level. It is
			asynchronous with normal matter.
			In essence, Captain -- Mister Worf
			does not belong in our universe.
			What?
			All matter in the universe
			resonates on a quantum level with
			a unique signature. This
			signature is a constant. It
			cannot be changed by any known
			process. It is the basic
			foundation of existence.
			And you believe that Worf's
			quantum signature is different
			from ours...
			Yes, sir. I cannot explain it.
			It is as if he originates from a
			different quantum universe.
			But he's standing right here in
			front of us. He's been on the
			ship for seven years.
			I cannot explain that either.
			According to my understanding of
			physics, Worf should not exist.
			You say these discontinuities
			started to occur after you
			returned from a Bat'leth
			tournament on Forcas Three.
			Yes sir.
			Now, I know for a fact that you
			didn't attend that tournament...
			and that no shuttlecraft has left
			the Enterprise for over a month.
			I understand. But I also clearly
			remember attending the tournament,
			and returning to the ship in a
			shuttlecraft.
			Do you remember the course you
			took to return to the ship?
			I think so.
			Let's backtrack that course... see
			if there are any unusual readings
			or anomalies.
			Aye, sir.
			If I may inquire, sir... how long
			have you been Captain?
			Four years. Ever since Captain
			Picard was killed during an
			incident with the Borg.
			You don't remember any of this, do
			you?
			I do remember. I just remember it
			differently.
			Captain -- I'm picking up a minor
			subspace disturbance off the port
			bow.
			Full stop.
			Analysis, Data.
			It appears to be a guantum fissure
			in the space-time continuum.
			On screen.
			The anomaly cannot be seen.
			However, I believe I can enhance
			it with a warp field to make it
			visible.
			Is it dangerous?
			Not at this distance, sir.
			I am also detecting an ion trail
			intersecting the phenomenon. I
			believe it was left by a Starfleet
			type-six shuttlecraft.
			So I was here...
			I have an explanation, sir.
			I believe the quantum fissure we
			discovered is a fixed point across
			the space-time continuum -- a
			"keyhole" that intersects many
			different quantum realities.
			What do you mean by "quantum
			realities"?
			For any event, there is an
			infinite number of possible
			outcomes. Our choices determine
			which outcome will follow. But
			there is a theory in quantum
			physics that all possibilities
			that could happen do happen in
			alternate quantum realities.
			For instance, in a different
			quantum reality, Captain Riker may
			have chosen to sit at the other
			end of the table. While in
			another reality, the Captain may
			be standing.
			So at this moment, there are an
			infinite number of Enterprises...
			and an infinite number of Doctor
			Crushers having this discussion.
			Yes. Although on some of those
			Enterprises, there may not be a
			Doctor Crusher...
			And somehow I have been shifting
			from one reality to another...
			That is correct.
			How did this happen?
			When Worf's shuttlecraft made
			contact with the quantum fissure,
			I believe its warp engines caused
			a small break in the barriers
			between quantum realties.
			Worf was thrown into a state of
			quantum flux.
			He immediately began to shift to
			other realities.
			And Geordi's VISOR somehow
			triggered that...
			Exactly. The VISOR uses a
			subspace field pulse. I think
			that whenever Geordi came near
			Worf, the field pulse intensified
			the quantum flux and pushed Worf
			into another reality.
			How can we find my original
			quantum state... and return me to
			it?
			Data... what if we scanned the
			quantum fissure using a subspace
			differential pulse? Maybe we
			could locate the quantum state
			that shares Worf's signature...
			and find a way to get him back.
			An excellent idea, Lieutenant.
			Proceed.
			Worf...
			From what I understand, there's a
			good chance that my Worf won't
			return...
			And I guess it's just hard for me
			to accept that there's a reality
			out there where you never loved
			me...
			Deanna... I have always considered
			you a close friend.
			And although I have never
			seriously considered a romantic
			relationship... I am not opposed
			to the possibility...
			And what about our children?
			Children...
			You didn't know?
			When the last shift occurred in
			Sickbay, we did not have
			children...
			We have a little girl... Shannara.
			She's two years-old. And we have
			a three year-old boy. Eric-Christopher.
			What about Alexander?
			Alexander?
			He was my son... in another
			reality.
			I've used a differential pulse to
			analyze over ten million quantum
			states within the fissure... but
			I still haven't found the one with
			your signature.
			This may take some time, sir.
			Captain -- there is a Bajoran ship
			approaching.
			Red Alert.
			Sir... the Bajorans?
			Ever since the Bajorans overthrew
			the Cardassian Empire, they've
			been getting more and more
			aggressive.
			Yesterday they destroyed one of
			our subspace telescopes... they
			thought we were using it to spy on
			them.
			They're charging their weapons,
			sir...
			Shields!
			Return fire!
			Captain, they've damaged our power
			systems -- it's caused an energy
			surge within the subspace
			pulse....
			The quantum fissure is beginning
			to destabilize.
			Can you disengage the pulse?
			Too late, sir.
			What the hell's happening?
			The barriers between quantum
			realties are breaking down. Other
			realties are emerging into our
			own.
			The Bajoran ship is disengaging.
			The rate of quantum incursions is
			increasing exponentially.
			At this rate, the sector will be
			completely filled with Enterprises
			within three days.
			Sir -- we are receiving two
			hundred eighty-five thousand hails
			from other ships.
			I wish I knew what to tell them...
			Data -- can we stop these
			incursions?
			Perhaps -- if we find the ship
			which matches Commander Worf's
			quantum signature.
			How would that help?
			It was Worf's shuttlecraft which
			traversed the fissure and weakened
			the barriers between quantum
			realities. If he re-enters the
			fissure in his original shuttle,
			and emits a broad-spectrum warp
			field -- it may be enough to seal
			the fissure and stop additional
			realities from emerging into our
			own.
			Then what? How do we get the
			Enterprises that are already here
			back to where they belong?
			In theory, the act of sealing the
			fissure should also restore the
			barriers between quantum states.
			The ships would return to their
			own realities.
			Lieutenant Crusher, send out a
			general hail to all ships.
			This is Captain Riker of the
			Enterprise... that is, the
			Enterprise which is indigenous to
			this universe. We have all
			encountered a quantum anomaly. We
			think we have a way to return all
			of us to our proper realities. We
			need to find the ship which
			exhibits a particular quantum
			signature. Our Mister Data will
			transmit the signature to you now.
			Anything?
			There's too much com traffic,
			sir... it's tough to isolate
			who's talking to who...
			Wait. Here it is... one ship is
			responding...
			Onscreen.
			Captain... we appear to have the
			quantum signature you're looking
			for.
			Data believes that by sending Worf
			through the fissure again, it
			would send all of us to our own
			realities.
			Our Data has said the same thing.
			We need you to send us your
			shuttlecraft Borges.
			We'll prepare to launch it now.
			It's... good to see you again,
			Captain. It's been a long time.
			Did they send the right shuttle?
			Yes. Its quantum signature
			matches Commander Worf's
			precisely.
			I have re-modulated the shuttle's
			engines to emit an inverse warp
			field. You will need to activate
			the field at the precise moment
			you enter the fissure.
			Assuming it works... what will
			happen? Will I find myself near
			my own ship?
			That is one possibility. However,
			the uncertainty principle dictates
			that time is a variable in this
			equation. You may end up several
			days before this event -- or
			several days after it. There is
			no way to tell.
			I understand.
			Good luck.
			Goodbye, Deanna.
			Setting course for the fissure...
			Acknowledged.
			Captain -- the shuttle is under
			attack!
			The Bajorans again?
			No sir -- it's one of the
			Enterprises.
			They're hailing us.
			On screen.
			We won't go back! You don't know
			what it's like in our universe.
			The Federation is gone -- the Borg
			are everywhere! We're one of the
			last ships left! Please, you've
			got to help us!
			I'm sorry. There's no choice. If
			this works, everything will return
			to --
			No! We won't go!
			They're firing on the shuttle!
			Open fire! Try to disable them!
			Direct hit... their shields have
			collapsed... their engine core's
			overloading --
			What happened?
			It looks like their ship had
			already taken heavy damage --
			their warp containment field must
			have been weak.
			Probably from fighting the Borg...
			Captain -- Worf is entering the
			fissure.
			Charging primary systems...
			initiating inverse warp field...
			Worf to Enterprise.
			Enterprise here.
			Captain -- is everything alright?
			Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a
			problem?
			I do not believe so. But I will
			explain when I arrive.
			How was the Bat'leth tournament?
			I won... "Champion Standing."
			So you don't think this... quantum
			fissure is anything we have to
			worry about?
			No. I believe the inverse warp
			field resealed it.
			I look forward to reading your
			report.
			Something wrong?
			I know what you are planning.
			I will not be surprised.
			Surprised? I don't know what
			you're talking about.
			Of course you don't.
			Worf... welcome home.
			I hope you don't mind I let myself
			in. I promised Alexander I'd feed
			his Dalvin hissing beetle while
			you were both away.
			So... you do not live here?
			What is that supposed to mean?
			It is a... long story.
			Happy birthday.
			Wil wanted to give you a surprise
			party, but I knew you'd hate it...
			so I talked him out of it.
			Thank you.
			Well... I know Klingons like to be
			alone on their birthdays.
			I'm sure you have to meditate, or
			hit yourself with a pain stick or
			something.
			Deanna... you do not have to
			leave.
			Oh?
			I have not had dinner. Would you
			care to... join me?
			I'd love to.
