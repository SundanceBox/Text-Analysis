			That's very nice.
			No, it isn't. I just can't get it
			right. Do you think the wings are
			too big?
			Not at all... birds have wings of
			all sizes, Eric. But you
			shouldn't worry about making it
			look perfect.
			But Mrs. Narsu said we should try
			to make our sculptures as
			realistic as possible.
			She's right... it is important for
			you to be able to give the clay
			the shape you want it to have.
			But today you're not supposed to
			concentrate on technique. I'm
			here to help you focus more on the
			feelings you want to convey with
			your sculpture.
			For instance... What do you think
			about when you see a bird?
			Flying?
			Fine. Then try to make your
			sculpture make me think of flying,
			too.
			How's it going, Data?
			I have finished.
			The dimensions are accurate to
			within one-point-three percent.
			I'm sure they are...
			You obviously have no trouble with
			realism, Data, but you're here to
			work on using your imagination.
			Maybe you should try something a
			little more... abstract.
			I want you to start a new piece...
			I'd like you to sculpt... music.
			Music?
			Counselor. Music is a collection
			of acoustic vibrations. How can
			I reproduce a sound with clay?
			Think of the effects that sounds
			have on people... the images that
			music brings to your mind... then
			give them a form.
			It's a start.
			Riker to Data... please report to
			the Bridge.
			Acknowledged. I am on my way.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47615.2.
			We have encountered a rogue comet
			in sector one-one-five-six. It is
			not native to this region of
			space, and there is no previous
			record of this object on any
			Federation charts.
			Based on its present trajectory,
			the comet appears to have
			originated in the D'Arsay system.
			That's over two sectors from
			here...
			That is correct, sir. This object
			has been en route for eighty-seven
			million years.
			That's a long time alone in the
			dark.
			Begin a full sensor analysis,
			Mister Data. Log the results for
			the Federation Astrophysical
			Survey.
			Aye, sir.
			The comet's outer shell is
			composed primarily of gaseous
			hydrogen and helium surrounding an
			icy mantle. The inner core
			consists of heavier elements--
			What was that?
			There is distortion within the
			comet's inner core. I believed we
			experienced an intense sensor
			echo.
			Can you correct for it?
			I am attempting to do so now,
			sir...
			I've compensated for the effect.
			Sensors are reconfigured for a low
			intensity sweep.
			We are still picking up some
			interference, but the distortion
			is manageable...
			At these settings, the scan will
			be complete in thirty-nine hours.
			... Worf said he's going to be
			teaching us some Mok'bara throwing
			techniques today.
			More like falling techniques...
			the last time we did that I was
			sore for a week...
			What's this?
			I have no idea.
			Maybe Wil left it here... a little
			present?
			It's not quite his style...
			Then maybe you've got a secret
			admirer.
			That's an interesting thought...
			Well, you can figure it out later.
			We're going to be late.
			We've been getting some pretty
			strange readings from that
			comet... now it looks like
			there's some kind of energy
			generation coming from the core.
			Is that unusual?
			The core is normally just a chunk
			of rock... it should be completely
			inert.
			Maybe we've discovered a new kind
			of comet...
			They must be changing the snacks
			around here.
			I don't recognize it.
			Well, whatever you do, don't put
			it in your mouth.
			This is terrible.
			I like it.
			Then you can have it.. but it's
			not what I ordered.
			Let's see what they're trying to
			poison you with...
			Wait a minute... this stuff is bio-organic...
			there are oxygenated
			cells... serum electrolytes...
			This looks like some kind of...
			blood.
			You're joking.
			I'm serious.
			I'm gonna have a little talk with
			the bartender.
			It might not be his fault. We
			should check out the replicator.
			Nice... Very good... I like
			that...
			Data... This is amazing. How did
			you come up with this?
			I followed your advice, Counselor.
			I used my imagination.
			That's an understatement...
			For some reason, as I shaped the
			clay, the image of the mask was
			exceptionally clear in my mind...
			the design seemed to flow quite...
			naturally.
			Data, have you been in my
			quarters?
			No, Counselor.
			Somebody left an object in my
			room... it was some kind of
			artifact... and it looked similar
			to this.
			You don't know anything about
			that?
			I do not.
			Excuse me, Counselor, could you
			help me with my terminal? It's
			not working right.
			Perhaps we should investigate this
			matter further.
			These symbols don't match anything
			in Federation linguistic banks.
			Some kind of alien information has
			been downloaded into our main
			computer. I'm not exactly sure
			how it's working, but it's
			reconfiguring our systems.
			How did it get in?
			I was able to trace its path from
			the replicators to our sensor
			array.
			The sensors?
			They've been scanning that comet
			for the last eighteen hours...
			Those energy readings from the
			comet's core... the sensor echo...
			We still don't know what's inside
			that thing.
			Maybe it's time we found out.
			Could we use the phasers to melt
			away the outer shell of the comet?
			A dispersed wide-field beam might
			do the trick... it wouldn't take
			long to come up with the firing
			parameters...
			What do you think, Data?
			What's the matter?
			I believe I recognize these
			symbols.
			How?
			I do not know.
			Do you think your systems may have
			been affected?
			It is a possibility. I do not
			believe my systems are currently
			impaired, but I will run a full
			self-diagnostic to make certain.
			What do these symbols mean?
			"Boundary."
			"Border." "Road." "Companion."
			"Message." "Messenger."
			"Death."
			Captain, phasers are set for wide
			dispersal, ten percent maximum
			power. The beam will terminate
			automatically when the comet's
			core is reached.
			Very well, Mister Worf. Fire...
			Phasers have terminated... the
			outer shell is gone...
			Mister Data... What are we looking
			at? Is it a ship?
			I do not believe so. The object
			is nearly solid, composed
			primarily of fortanium and several
			unknown materials... It is more
			than eighty-seven million years
			old.
			That's older than the comet
			itself. Could someone in the
			D'Arsay system have built it?
			There are no technologically
			advanced cultures in that system
			now... but perhaps there were
			eighty-seven million years ago.
			But why would anyone hide
			something like that inside a
			comet?
			It's possible the frozen gasses
			simply accumulated over time as it
			travelled through space...
			In any case, it's definitely
			responsible for the system
			anomalies we've been experiencing.
			It's been using our sensor beam as
			a carrier wave to get information
			into our computers and
			replicators.
			But the question remains: why?
			What is its purpose?
			Captain, I believe this object is
			an informational archive.
			What makes you say that?
			I... do not know, sir. However,
			I seem to have an intuitive
			understanding of its function.
			The internal structure of that
			thing is pretty complex... and
			it's got a repetitive node
			configuration which might suggest
			a database of some kind... but it
			could be practically anything.
			I don't see how you could know for
			sure what it is.
			Data... do you believe you're in
			communication with that object?
			It is a possibility, sir. I
			recommend that we perform a level
			one diagnostic of my positronic
			net immediately to determine if
			that is the case.
			Very well... Mister LaForge, give
			him a hand.
			Do you think it's just trying to
			make contact with us?
			Perhaps. And if this really is an
			archive from some ancient
			civilization, we should allow it
			to do so. But we must be
			careful...
			Mister Worf, keep an eye on the
			sensors. If the Archive poses any
			danger to the ship, I want you to
			sever the connection immediately.
			Aye, sir.
			Come.
			Captain...
			Come in, Number One...
			We've confined the system
			corruption. It's not spreading
			any further, but we've still got
			alien symbols floating around
			inside our computer...
			This is quite a collection you've
			assembled...
			I've seen these things all over
			the ship. They all look the
			same... primitive and non-functional.
			Ceremonial... and deceptively
			primitive. Only an advanced
			technological culture could have
			built that object out there.
			These artifacts must have played
			a ritualistic role in their
			society.
			Do you think Data's right? Have
			we stumbled across some kind of
			alien library?
			It's possible... and if so, this
			could be a find of enormous
			significance. This "library"
			seems designed to do far more than
			simply store information. Who
			knows how much we could learn from
			it?
			I keep seeing this design...
			It seems to be a symbol of some
			significance.
			What do you think it means?
			The concept of the four cardinal
			compass directions is common to
			many different cultures...
			The words Data recognized on the
			computer -- "boundary," "border,"
			"road" -- they were also arranged
			in that design.
			Perhaps everything with the
			compass design is part of the same
			theme -- movement. Finding a
			direction, travelling a path,
			crossing a boundary--
			And "death." One of the symbols
			was "death."
			The ultimate boundary.
			I keep seeing this symbol, too....
			but it's never prominently
			displayed...
			Always in the background...
			smaller than the others...
			Do you know what it represents?
			I have no idea.
			Lower synaptic functions are
			completely normal... Autonomous
			systems all check out...
			I suggest we examine the memory
			sub-systems next.
			All right...
			Data... what's the matter?
			I am... not certain. I am
			experiencing a curious
			sensation...
			What is it?
			An... impulse.
			Impulse? What kind of impulse?
			I do not know.
			I'm checking your higher
			functions.
			Geordi... What does it feel like
			when a person... loses his mind?
			Data, you're scaring me. What's
			the matter?
			I... do not... know...
			You're gonna be all right. You're
			with me, okay?
			Okay.
			What's going on... ?
			Data...
			Masaka is waking.
			Captain, he just--
			I waited for you, Captain. You
			should feel honored... I don't
			usually wait for anybody.
			What is it you want?
			Masaka is waking.
			Are you Masaka?
			What were my exact words?
			You said, "Masaka is waking."
			And isn't that what I've been
			saying since we first met?
			I'm not "Masaka", Captain...
			I am Ihat.
			What have you done to Commander
			Data?
			Commander Data... ?
			You mean the one who was here?
			Yes.
			He's gone. And who can say where?
			Counselor Troi, report to
			Engineering immediately.
			Ihat. The place you came from...
			Is it a cultural archive of your
			species?
			I come from Masaka's city.
			Are there others like you there?
			There are no others like me.
			Who is Masaka?
			You will find out...
			I don't think Masaka will like
			this place... at least not the way
			it is now...
			I would like to know more about
			this Masaka... perhaps we can
			speak --
			Do you understand pain? Death?
			That is all you need to know about
			Masaka... that is what she is.
			You must go... leave this place
			before she finds you. It can be
			done... I did it...
			What's going on, sir?
			Masaka... ?
			Data!
			Masaka! I am yours! Every part
			of me is yours!
			Get him to Sickbay.
			Every time he saw Deanna, he'd
			fall to his knees screaming "Take
			me, Masaka -- take me."
			Data was acting as if he were a
			sacrificial victim of some kind...
			And apparently one all too willing
			to go to his death.
			I put him in isolation in his
			quarters. He's under guard... he
			seems to have calmed down a
			little.
			Couldn't we just shut him down and
			purge his memory systems?
			I don't think it's going to be
			that simple...
			This is a micrograph of what's
			happened to Data's positronic net.
			As near as I can tell, these are
			behavioral nodes... I've found
			fourteen of them so far.
			I think the Archive is using Data
			to create different "people" from
			its culture... in the same way it
			used our replicators to create
			artifacts.
			As a result, his real personality
			has been completely buried. In a
			sense, Data has the android
			equivalent of multiple
			personalities.
			And the Archive hasn't stopped
			yet... Data's positronic net is
			still being transformed. There's
			no way to tell how many more
			personalities might emerge...
			Our sensors are still in contact
			with the Archive. Would there be
			a risk to Data if we severed that
			connection?
			I don't know... but I wouldn't
			want to take the chance. Right
			now, our only link to the Archive
			is that sensor beam. If there's
			a way to reverse what's happened
			to Data, I think we're going to
			need that link to do it.
			Mister La Forge, continue to scan
			the Archive. Try to find some way
			to access it. In the meantime,
			I'll see what I can learn from
			these "people" inside Data.
			It's all right... I'm not going to
			hurt you...
			Only Masaka can hurt me... I am
			for her alone...
			I need to speak to Ihat. Do you
			understand me? Ihat...
			Captain...
			That was a cruel joke to play on
			me. For a moment -- a brief
			moment -- I actually thought that
			woman was Masaka.
			Whoever took your place wasn't
			afraid of Masaka -- he almost
			seemed eager for his fate.
			Pitiful, isn't it?
			"Take me! Take me!" Ha. You
			wouldn't catch me humiliating
			myself for a woman -- even if she
			were a queen.
			Then Masaka is your queen... ?
			She's a lazy creature... she
			spends most of her time
			sleeping...
			The problem is what she does when
			she's awake.
			Then should we try to keep her
			asleep?
			Try to keep the sun from climbing
			the sky? Only Korgano can do
			that. And he's not here.
			Where is he?
			Help me... please...
			What's wrong?
			I'm afraid.
			Of what?
			Of her.
			Masaka?
			Her.
			Picard to Bridge! Report!
			The Archive just activated some
			kind of tractor beam, sir. We
			can't disengage it.
			Has there been any damage to the
			ship?
			Nothing major, sir, but Ten
			Forward reported an emergency.
			Worf's on his way.
			Captain, there's some kind of
			energy pulse coming through the
			tractor beam...
			It's overriding our control
			systems...
			I'll be right there...
			Don't leave me.
			I... I... won't... leave you...
			Please... let go...
			Does it hurt?
			Yes...
			She's going to hurt us all...
			Now you've done it. Masaka is
			awake.
			Who is this?
			I'd say it's Masaka. Ihat
			referred to her as a queen... it's
			not unusual in ceremonial cultures
			for royalty to be symbolized by a
			sun.
			You said the personalities inside
			Data were in awe of her... even
			terrified.
			According to Data, the sun image
			is also the symbol for death.
			There it is again... this U-shaped
			symbol... small and
			insignificant... almost like an
			afterthought...
			Captain, this is incredible...
			These artifacts weren't beamed
			over here from the archive... the
			matter in Ten Forward was
			transformed.
			Into living plants? How is that
			possible?
			I'm not sure. But bit by bit, the
			ship's being transformed.
			We have received reports from the
			rest of the ship. Part of deck
			twelve is now an aqueduct.
			What are we being transformed
			into?
			I'm not sure I want to find out.
			I don't think we have a choice...
			we'll have to destroy the Archive.
			Mister Worf?
			Sir, our weapon control systems
			are inoperative. However, we
			could configure a photon torpedo
			for manual launch...
			Make it so.
			There's so much here we could have
			learned... I regret losing that
			opportunity.
			Okay... I've locked in the
			targeting parameters... what's the
			phase alignment now?
			Less than point seven percent.
			That'll do it. I'm setting the
			yield at maximum...
			Sir... the onboard power systems
			are not functioning...
			What's going on here... ?
			Something tells me we'd better get
			out of here...
			Engineering to Bridge -- emergency
			transport! Two to beam out...
			Maybe we'd better talk in here.
			The Observation Lounge seems to
			have become a swamp.
			What's our status?
			So far the Archive's transformed
			over twenty percent of the ship...
			and we've lost main propulsion and
			weapons systems in the process.
			What about communications?
			Sensors? Life support?
			We have communications, and
			limited sensor control. Life
			support seems unaffected.
			I've been analyzing samples of
			these alien plant forms. They've
			been formed from biological matter
			we have on the ship...
			The stone, the artifacts...
			they're made the same way --
			extrapolated from the ship's own
			alloys.
			Apparently the Archive can reorder
			and transform molecular structures --
			including DNA -- to make whatever
			it wants.
			So it's using our ship -- our
			alloys, our DNA, -- to create
			elements of its own culture...
			But why is all this happening?
			What is the Archive trying to
			accomplish?
			It could be a weapon.
			It is powerful and insidious. It
			has completely disarmed us.
			Maybe it's more benign than that.
			If a civilization were dying...
			they might have created this
			technology to preserve their
			culture, and re-create it at some
			later point...
			It could even be a sophisticated
			terraforming device.
			The Archive creates an
			environment... all the elements
			which enable a culture to exist...
			But whatever the intent behind the
			process, I don't want this ship
			transformed into an alien city.
			Mister La Forge, do you have any
			ideas?
			We still haven't been able to cut
			off that beam... but I've managed
			to access the Archive by sending
			an energy pulse back along their
			signal path. If I can locate the
			transformation program, I might be
			able to get control of it.
			Good, keep at it...
			But somehow... I believe the
			answer lies there...
			... with Masaka. We need to find
			her... access her... talk to her.
			Hello...
			It's difficult... to stay warm...
			The fire feels good...
			But it's not warm enough. Not for
			an old man.
			Tell me... about Masaka.
			My daughter?
			Yes... how can I talk to her?
			Talk -- to Masaka?
			Yes. It's important. Can you
			tell her I must speak with her?
			Children grow... forget their
			parents... no, only Korgano can
			talk to Masaka.
			Korgano... who is that?
			So cold... can't stay warm...
			Well, you're a persistent one,
			aren't you?
			Ihat?
			Is anyone else so charming?
			Masaka is taking over my ship.
			I told you she would.
			I want to talk with her... but I'm
			told only Korgano can do that.
			Who told you that?
			An old man... Masaka's father...
			Ah, yes... legends say she chopped
			him up and used his bones to make
			the world.
			Any wonder he doesn't like to talk
			about her?
			How can I find Korgano?
			I don't know. He's not chasing
			her anymore.
			Where has he gone?
			Stop asking these questions. I
			was fast enough to avoid her
			once... I don't want her to find
			me again. I'll end up on her
			sacrificial slab.
			If Masaka is looking for a
			sacrifice... she can take me
			instead.
			Perhaps then she'd stop looking
			for you.
			Well, there's an idea. Better you
			than me.
			All right. Tell me what to do...
			You must build Masaka's temple...
			the Queen's temple. That will get
			her attention.
			Very well. How do I do that?
			You need the sign.
			I could give it to you... so could
			the Old Man. But just try getting
			it out of him.
			Give me the sign.
			If she finds out...
			You can't imagine her rage... she
			lets people die of thirst... a
			terrible death. Sometimes she
			burns them alive...
			She is glorious.
			Ihat... the sign. What is it?
			If she comes... you'll take my
			place?
			Yes.
			All right. Quickly. Give me your
			hand.
			A line, as the unending horizon...
			A curve as --
			She has found me.
			Masaka, show yourself. I'll go
			with you...
			It seems... I was not fast
			enough...
			So hard to stay warm...
			Let me help you...
			Are you one of my children?
			I don't remember anymore.
			I need your help. I need the sign
			for the temple.
			Masaka's temple.
			It won't help you. Korgano no
			longer pursues her. No one else
			can stop her.
			A line... as the unending
			horizon...
			A curve...
			A line... as the unending horizon.
			... as a rolling hillside.
			A point... as a distant bird.
			A ray... as the rising sun.
			Thank you.
			Now sit with me... tend the
			fire...
			I'm alone... there's no one left
			to help me... she's coming.
			Are the others dead? Did Masaka
			kill them?
			No. She sent them away. It will
			take them days to die.
			I think I've found the Archive's
			transformation program.
			Will it accept the symbol for
			Masaka's temple?
			I think so. I've isolated the
			program's input pathways. They're
			keyed to accept symbols...
			If I input this one, it should
			initiate the transformation
			process...
			And create the temple?
			I hope so... if this is the wrong
			symbol, it might turn the
			Enterprise into a big chunk of
			rock. There's no way to be sure.
			The question is... can we trust a
			personality from an alien Archive
			that seems bent on taking us over?
			Ihat risked his life to show me
			that symbol... and Masaka killed
			him for doing it.
			I think we have to risk it.
			Captain. The entire deck has been
			cleared of personnel. We can
			proceed.
			Commander Riker, we're ready...
			Understood.
			Initiate the transformation.
			Aye, sir. I'm inputting the
			symbol...
			Now...
			This would seem to be Masaka's
			temple...
			There's no one else here.
			Ihat said creating the temple
			would get her attention... it may
			take time before she shows
			herself.
			And how will she do that?
			I don't know.
			Captain... look at this.
			This is the first time I've seen
			these two symbols paired... That
			could be significant...
			There it is again... and again.
			Clearly this is an important
			pairing...
			"He's not chasing her anymore... "
			Sir?
			Ihat said that someone named
			Korgano was not chasing Masaka
			anymore. And the old man said,
			"he pursues her no longer... "
			In a sense, this smaller symbol is
			chasing Masaka. Perhaps it
			represents Korgano.
			The symbol suggests antlers of
			some kind... horns. Maybe it's
			meant to represent an animal...
			Animal gods are worshipped in many
			cultures...
			Both Ihat and the old man said
			that Korgano was the only one who
			could control Masaka...
			Many ritualistic cultures
			incorporate the idea of "balance"
			into their belief systems. Masaka
			is a queen, a powerful, god-like
			figure... it's not unreasonable to
			assume that she might have a
			counterpart... or a consort...
			Spread out... see if you can find
			that horn-like symbol anywhere
			else.
			This is the most prominent
			instance of the horn symbol we've
			seen yet...
			But now it appears as though
			Masaka's sun is chasing it.
			An animal chasing the sun... ?
			Maybe it's simpler than that.
			Maybe the relationship between
			them is more like the sun and the
			moon.
			I see... Masaka and Korgano
			changing positions... the sun
			setting and the moon rising.
			Exactly. Two powerful rulers,
			changing places in a continuous
			cycle...
			And like the sun and the moon,
			only one of them can be in
			ascendance at any given time...
			If we could find Korgano within
			the Archive and bring him out...
			perhaps he could force Masaka to
			leave.
			But would we be any better off
			with him?
			Ihat and the others didn't seem to
			be afraid of Korgano...
			Masaka...
			Masaka, I am Jean-Luc Picard of
			the Federation--
			Go away.
			Please listen to us. Your Archive
			is destroying our ship--
			I do not hear you.
			She won't even listen to us.
			Then we'll have to find someone
			she will listen to.
			I've found it, sir...
			This is the only place in the
			Archive where Korgano's moon
			symbol is by itself and not paired
			with Masaka's.
			Mister La Forge, access the
			transformation program.
			When you're ready, input the
			symbol.
			Isn't that a little risky?
			We have no way of knowing what the
			result would be. The symbol might
			generate anything from Korgano's
			temple... to Korgano himself.
			In some sense, Korgano is Masaka's
			nemesis. Whatever this symbol
			represents -- it might give us a
			way to control her.
			If you have a better idea, I'd be
			glad to entertain it.
			I've accessed the program, sir.
			Initiate the transformation.
			Another mask...
			Perhaps we've been approaching
			this incorrectly. We're dealing
			with a highly ritualistic
			culture... a society based on
			symbol and myth. Maybe we need to
			confront them on those terms
			instead...
			If I can incorporate myself into
			their rituals, perhaps Masaka will
			listen to me.
			You're going to pose as Korgano.
			Captain, we know so little about
			this culture... and even less
			about Korgano himself. How will
			you convince Masaka that you're
			him?
			I'm not entirely sure. But there
			are similarities between this
			culture and others I've studied.
			I suppose I'll just have to
			improvise.
			Mister Worf, what's our status?
			I estimate we have less than two
			hours before there's nothing left
			of the ship... at least nothing
			that we recognize.
			Masaka!
			Korgano... ?
			Are you surprised to see me?
			I thought I had escaped you.
			You should know that's impossible.
			You are a fine hunter... but I am
			a powerful prey. You will never
			catch me.
			Do you really want to be the
			prey... forever?
			I thought I was alone here. I
			thought I wouldn't have to share
			the sky with you...
			But without me... you aren't
			complete. I know you, Masaka...
			you live for the chase just as
			much as I do.
			Won't you miss being the hunter...
			pursuing me... forcing me from the
			sky so that you can rise again?
			You know me well, Korgano...
			I think you may be getting
			tired... it's difficult to
			brighten the sky forever...
			I am getting sleepy... you always
			do that to me...
			Only so you can wake at dawn...
			and begin the hunt again...
			Begin the hunt again...
			I am eager for that.
			As am I.
			Riker to Picard... I don't know
			what you did, sir... but it looks
			like everything's back to normal.
			Acknowledged.
			Mister Data -- are you all right?
			I believe so, sir. But I am not
			entirely certain what has
			happened. Have I been dreaming
			again?
			I'm afraid it will take some time
			to explain.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47612.4.
			Commander La Forge has managed to
			disable the alien transformation
			program. Starfleet will send an
			archaeological team to study the
			Archive further.
			I don't understand... I thought
			all the alien artifacts had
			disappeared from the Enterprise.
			This was not created by the
			Archive... this is the clay mask
			I originally made. I have since
			glazed it.
			Yes. Although I am relieved to be
			rid of those alien
			personalities... there is a sense
			in which I am now... empty.
			I can imagine. Doctor Crusher
			said there might have been dozens
			of personalities inside you.
			I suspect the number was much
			greater.
			My impression is that there were
			thousands... of all ages and walks
			of life.
			It was a remarkable experience.
			Well, Data, you may never become
			fully human... but you've had an
			experience that transcends the
			human condition.
			You have been an entire
			civilization.
			Nonetheless... it's time to stand
			watch on the night shift.
			Yes, sir. Good night.
