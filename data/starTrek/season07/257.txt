			Direct hit to the port nacelle...
			But -- only minimal damage.
			Hit on the starboard nacelle...
			again, no appreciable damage.
			Wil must've done something to
			their weapons.
			I believe so, Counselor. It is
			now up to us to... play along.
			Release inertial dampers and cut
			power on decks thirty-one through
			thirty-seven.
			Set phasers to twenty-five
			percent. Return fire.
			Aye, sir.
			Continue firing!
			We've lost three plasma relays on
			the disruptors. Auxiliary
			power... is not available.
			Transfer weapons control to my
			station. There's a way to by-pass
			the relays and feed power --
			The anti-matter containment unit
			is starting to buckle!
			The Enterprise has been badly
			damaged but they still have
			superior firepower. If we remain
			here, we will be destroyed. The
			logical course of action is to
			withdraw.
			We've done enough damage. Narik,
			set course one eight zero, mark
			two one five. Warp six.
			Initiate.
			They're preparing to activate
			their warp drive, Commander.
			Sir. We will not be able to track
			them with our sensors if they go
			to warp. I can still disable them
			before they --
			I am aware of the tactical
			situation, Lieutenant. Let them
			go.
			Sensor sweep eight has been
			completed, sir. Still no sign of
			the mercenary ship.
			Understood. Begin sensor sweep
			nine using the lateral array set
			to maximum gain.
			Aye, sir.
			I've gone over every word, every
			inflection, every facial
			response... but I still haven't
			found any kind of code or hidden
			message.
			Understood. I agree that the
			probability that such a message
			exists is remote, but I believe we
			should check.
			I'll keep trying.
			Two starships have been sent to
			intercept the mercenaries at
			Yadalla Prime and Draken Four, in
			case they attempt to attack those
			planets.
			Very well. Inform Starfleet
			Command that we will hold position
			here until further notice.
			So we are just going to... remain
			here?
			Yes. But we will continue to
			pursue all avenues of
			investigation which are available
			to us.
			If we had not allowed them to
			escape, this would not be
			necessary.
			That is correct. However, I
			believe Commander Riker wanted us
			to let them escape.
			I think I've got something.
			I've been studying the com link
			Commander Riker used to transmit
			his command codes.
			I didn't see anything at first,
			but when I ran the transmission
			through a sub-harmonic analysis I
			found this.
			It was sent on the same carrier
			wave as the command codes.
			It might be the message you've
			been looking for.
			Possibly. I will attempt to resequence
			the signal.
			Begin running a search for a
			decryption key.
			I'm taking the engines off-line.
			How long until we can repair our
			battle damage?
			It will take at least five hours
			to replace the anti-matter
			containment unit.
			You have three hours, Narik. One
			minute beyond that and you'll
			answer for it with your life.
			I suppose I should thank you.
			None of us would be alive if it
			weren't for you.
			You're welcome.
			What's wrong, Commander? Starting
			to have second thoughts about
			betraying your comrades... because
			that's what you've done --
			betrayed them... betrayed them in
			order to save yourself.
			You were just a second-rate
			officer before... now you're a
			coward and a traitor. How does
			that feel?
			I don't know. How did that feel?
			That's enough.
			Galen, get down to the cargo hold
			and check those artifacts.
			Move.
			Tell Baran I'm working as fast as
			I can.
			What?
			I'm trying to decide if you're
			incredibly stupid... or incredibly
			smart. Why didn't you continue to
			fire on the Enterprise when their
			shields dropped?
			You were there. The disruptors
			lost power.
			Computer, reset diagnostic for new
			sample and begin scan.
			I've watched you handle the weapon
			systems before. You know exactly
			how to by-pass a problem like
			that.
			And why do you continue to argue
			with Riker? It should be obvious
			that by alienating him you are
			also alienating Baran, and yet you
			continue to do it. Why?
			Scan complete. Terikon profile
			negative.
			I'm touched by your concern for my
			well-being.
			That's not an answer.
			Computer, reset diagnostic and
			begin scan.
			I'm not a prisoner in a Romulan
			labor camp, Tallera. I don't have
			to answer your questions and I
			don't give a damn what you think.
			Scan complete. Terikon profile
			positive. Ninety-eight percent
			probability of match.
			Well, whatever it is... it looks
			like we've found it.
			Tallera to Captain.
			Yes?
			I'm in the cargo hold. Galen's
			made a positive Terikon match on
			one of the artifacts.
			Is he sure?
			He's sure.
			Good. Bring it here immediately
			and don't let anyone else get near
			it.
			Understood. Tallera out.
			I take it that's good news.
			Very. It means we've completed
			half of what promises to be a very
			profitable mission... and even
			better than that it means, I'm
			almost ready to get rid of your
			friend Galen.
			Really?
			We have only one more artifact to
			find... and once Galen confirms
			it's genuine, his usefulness on
			this ship will come to a very
			sudden end.
			I can't say I'm sorry to hear
			that.
			I'm sure.
			Galen may be a loud-mouthed fool,
			but sometimes he can be very
			perceptive... his observations
			about you for instance.
			Oh?
			After what you did at Calder Two,
			I doubt you have much of a future
			in Starfleet.
			I've... pretty much come to the
			same conclusion.
			Assuming for the moment that you
			were no longer my prisoner... what
			would you do now?
			I guess I'd have to look for a new
			career... there must be a place
			where someone with fifteen years
			of Starfleet technical knowledge
			would be useful.
			Do you know of any place like
			that?
			Possibly.
			But if there's one thing I've
			learned on this ship, it's to be
			cautious... and not to blindly
			embrace what seems to be good
			fortune. And at the moment, you
			seem like a rather large stroke of
			luck.
			I haven't exactly sworn my undying
			allegiance to you, Baran. In
			fact, I'd like to know a little
			bit more about the job.
			Such as?
			Such as what you meant by a "very
			profitable mission."
			I thought you Starfleet types
			weren't interested in things like
			profit.
			I'm not exactly... the "ideal"
			Starfleet type.
			No, I guess you're not.
			All you need to know for now is
			that your share could be more than
			enough to insure a very long and
			very wealthy life far away from
			the Federation.
			Sounds promising.
			It is. But if you want that
			share, you'll have to earn it.
			And you can start by putting aside
			your dislike for Galen and trying
			to become his friend.
			Why?
			Galen has allies among the crew...
			they might cause a problem if I
			kill him. I want you to get close
			to him and find out who they are.
			Okay.
			One more thing, Riker.
			When the time comes, I want you to
			kill Galen.
			I have completed the analysis of
			the signal from the mercenary
			ship. I believe these groupings
			represent bearings and coordinates
			taken from their navigational
			system.
			So you think this is their flight
			plan...
			Yes. If I am correct, the
			mercenary vessel is heading toward
			these coordinates in...
			... the Hyralan Sector.
			Their maximum speed is warp eight
			point seven... it will take them
			at least fourteen hours to reach
			that position.
			We could be there in five.
			Make it so.
			Finally.
			Set course for the Hyralan Sector
			and engage at warp nine.
			Lieutenant, may I see you in the
			Ready Room?
			Of course.
			Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with
			your performance as acting first
			officer.
			May I... ask in what way?
			You continually question my orders
			in front of the crew. I do not
			think this is appropriate
			behavior.
			Sir... with all due respect, I
			have always felt free to voice my
			opinions... even when they
			differed from those of Captain
			Picard or Commander Riker.
			That is true. But in those
			situations, you were acting as
			head of security, not as First
			Officer. The primary role of the
			second in command is to carry out
			the decisions of the Captain... in
			this case, me.
			But is it not my duty to offer
			you... alternatives?
			Yes. But once I have made a
			decision, it is your job to carry
			it out regardless of how you may
			personally feel. Any further
			objections should be given to me
			in private, not in front of the
			crew.
			I do not recall Commander Riker
			ever publicly showing irritation
			with his Captain as you did a
			moment ago.
			No, sir.
			If you feel that you are not
			capable of carrying out this role,
			I can assign it to Commander La
			Forge and return you to Tactical.
			I would not enter it as a
			reprimand on your record... simply
			as a transfer.
			I would... prefer to remain at my
			current post.
			Then I will expect you to conform
			to the guidelines I have laid out.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Worf... I am sorry if I
			have ended our friendship.
			Sir... it is I who has jeopardized
			our friendship, not you. If you
			will... overlook this incident, I
			would like to continue to consider
			myself your friend.
			I would like that as well.
			Thank you, sir.
			Your time is almost up, Narik. I
			need warp power.
			You can't rush this, Baran... if
			the constrictor coil isn't
			perfectly aligned, the entire antimatter
			containment unit could
			rupture... and that would be the
			end of the engines, the ship, and
			us.
			I don't have time for your
			excuses. We have a schedule to
			keep.
			Can you do this any faster?
			I think Narik may be right this
			time... a constrictor coil will
			only align so fast. We'll have to
			wait.
			How long?
			I'd say another hour, maybe less.
			One hour.
			Where is Galen?
			In his quarters.
			Typical. Everyone else is working
			and he's asleep. Someone should
			go kick him out of bed.
			I'll take care of it.
			Good.
			It's good to see you, too.
			I've had a few... unpleasant
			surprises.
			This isn't a good idea, Wil.
			Baran may get suspicious.
			As a matter of fact, Baran's the
			one who sent me here.
			He told me to "wake you up," but
			he really wants me to "pretend" to
			get friendly with you and then
			help you organize a mutiny... so
			he can find your supporters among
			the crew and eliminate them.
			So here I am... pretending to like
			you after all.
			Wheels within wheels... I'm
			starting to forget which side I'm
			on.
			All right... what have you found
			out so far?
			When we get to the Hyralan Sector,
			we're supposed to rendezvous with
			a Klingon transport ship. I'm not
			sure, but I think they might be
			delivering another Romulan
			artifact to us.
			A second artifact... ?
			By the way, these artifacts aren't
			Romulan... they're Vulcan.
			Vulcan?
			I've been looking over the glyphs
			and pictograms I found on the
			Calder Two artifact. There's not
			enough data to translate the
			inscription, but the alphabet and
			symbology are more consistent with
			early Vulcan artifacts than
			Romulan.
			Do these artifacts have some kind
			of religious or cultural
			significance... something that
			would make them valuable enough to
			kill for?
			I don't know.
			If I could just get access to the
			Enterprise computer for even a few
			moments...
			What will Baran do once we obtain
			the second artifact?
			You're supposed to confirm it's
			authentic...
			... and then I'm supposed to kill
			you and take your place.
			You always seem to be after my
			job.
			Once Baran decides I've outlived
			my usefulness... he can simply
			kill me with the neural servo.
			I think... we'd better start
			planning a mutiny.
			We need a new captain... so I've
			come to one inescapable
			conclusion...
			I agree.
			But I don't think that's you.
			Oh?
			I don't trust you, Galen... and I
			don't think the rest of the crew
			does either. They're not going to
			follow you.
			And who do you think they'll
			follow... you?
			No. But they will follow
			Tallera... and so will I.
			Who are you?
			What?
			You're no smuggler... and I don't
			think your name's Galen.
			You will tell me who you really
			are and what you are doing on this
			ship... or I will kill you right
			here.
			I don't know what you're talking
			about.
			I will not play games with you.
			I found the message you sent to
			the Enterprise. When Riker used
			his command codes to drop their
			shields, you sent a transmission
			to them on the same carrier wave.
			You're a Starfleet officer.
			Do not bother to deny it. It is
			the only... logical conclusion.
			My name is actually T'Paal... I am
			a member of the V'Shar.
			Vulcan Security?
			That is correct. I infiltrated
			this ship a year ago posing as a
			Romulan mercenary. I am here to
			investigate a possible threat to
			Vulcan.
			What sort of threat?
			First things first, Galen. Who
			are you?
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise.
			Very well. To answer your
			question, for several years, there
			has been a small, but growing
			movement of extreme isolationists
			on Vulcan... a group that believes
			contact with alien races has
			"polluted" our culture... and is
			destroying Vulcan purity.
			This group advocates the total
			isolation of Vulcan from the rest
			of the galaxy and the eradication
			of all alien influences from our
			planet.
			It sounds like a very... illogical
			philosophy.
			Agreed. But extremists often have
			a logic all their own.
			What are these artifacts we're
			collecting? I know they're Vulcan
			in origin...
			I am sure you are familiar with
			the ancient history of my
			people... before we found
			logic... before we found peace.
			You were much like my people once
			were... a warlike, savage race...
			There was even a time when we used
			our telepathic abilities as a
			weapon... a time when we learned
			to kill with a thought.
			The Stone of Gol... ?
			You know of it?
			I know the story from Vulcan
			mythology. According to the
			legend whoever possessed the stone
			needed only to think of throwing
			it at someone... and that person
			would be killed.
			The Stone of Gol is real, but
			there is nothing magical or
			supernatural about it.
			It is a psionic resonator... a
			device which focuses and amplifies
			telepathic energy. It is one of
			the most devastating weapons ever
			conceived.
			As I recall the legend, the Stone
			of Gol was destroyed by the gods
			when the Vulcan people found the
			way to peace...
			The resonator was believed to have
			been destroyed during the Time of
			the Awakening. Only one piece was
			known to have survived and it was
			placed in a Vulcan museum under
			heavy guard.
			Six months ago, that piece was
			stolen from the museum. Soon
			after, mercenary ships began
			raiding archaeological sites
			across the quadrant. We believe
			that a member of the isolationist
			movement is trying to reassemble
			the resonator.
			A telepathic weapon...
			A Vulcan trained in the mental
			disciplines would be a formidable
			assassin. The entire Vulcan
			council could be killed with a
			single thought, and there would be
			no defense.
			My orders are to find that would-be
			assassin and stop him.
			Since Baran will presumably need
			to deliver the artifacts to this
			assassin in order to get paid, it
			would seem that the best course of
			action is to continue with our
			little masquerade for now.
			Agreed. But Captain... I cannot
			allow the resonator to be
			assembled. If necessary, I will
			destroy this ship, its crew... all
			of us... to prevent that from
			happening.
			Acting Captain's Log: Stardate
			47160.1. The Enterprise is
			entering the Hyralan Sector which
			I believe to be the next
			destination of the mercenary ship.
			We've arrived at the coordinates,
			sir.
			All stop. Full sensor sweep.
			I'm picking up a small vessel
			bearing one two seven mark three
			three five.
			Is it the mercenary ship?
			No, sir... it's a Klingon ship.
			It is a Toron-class
			shuttlecraft... one passenger.
			We're awfully far from the Klingon
			Empire... it can't be a
			coincidence the shuttle's at these
			coordinates.
			Agreed.
			Open a channel.
			I am Lieutenant Commander Data of
			the Federation Starship
			Enterprise.
			Koral.
			I take it that is your name?
			May I inquire as to your
			destination?
			No.
			May I ask the purpose of your
			journey?
			No.
			Perhaps I have not made our
			intentions clear... we are
			investigating a --
			He seems... most uncooperative.
			He may have been curt, but he was
			also very worried... even a little
			scared.
			Sir... I recommend that we bring
			the shuttle aboard with our
			tractor beam, search it, and
			interrogate Koral.
			According to the terms of the
			Klingon/Federation Treaty, Koral
			has every right to free transit
			through Federation space. We
			cannot board or search his vessel
			without cause.
			Yes, sir.
			However... the Treaty also gives
			us the right to conduct... health
			and safety inspections of any ship
			in our space.
			Health and safety inspections... ?
			Article forty-seven, paragraph
			three, subsection B: "Starfleet
			will have the right to insure all
			Klingon vessels comply with safety
			and navigational regulations as
			specified by mutual agreement."
			But I am not sure that using this
			clause as an excuse to conduct a
			search would be consistent with
			the spirit of the Treaty.
			Yes, sir.
			However, if Koral wishes to
			contest our actions he can file a
			protest with the Judge Advocate
			General's office.
			Bring the shuttle aboard and then
			you and Doctor Crusher may begin
			the inspection.
			Aye, sir.
			Hello.
			I'm Doctor Crusher, and this is
			Lieutenant Worf.
			We're here to conduct the health
			and safety inspection of your
			ship.
			Health and safety inspection...
			That's right. You know...
			radiation leaks... biochemical
			contamination... other health
			hazards...
			Well... no radiation so far... I'm
			sure you're glad to hear that...
			Right.
			There's an incoming message...
			it's from the Klingon shuttle.
			It was sent approximately fifteen
			minutes ago.
			He's at the rendezvous
			coordinates... but he's been
			detained by the Enterprise.
			That's all there is... he stopped
			transmitting.
			The Enterprise...
			How could they have found out
			about the rendezvous, Commander?
			How could I have known the
			rendezvous coordinates? If anyone
			sent them a message it must've
			been one of you.
			Or maybe you're a clever liar.
			Quiet.
			All that matters now is that the
			Enterprise has the second artifact
			in their possession.
			How can you be sure Koral had the
			piece when he was captured?
			The Klingon? He reported a
			positive Terikon match two weeks
			ago.
			We have no choice... we'll have to
			board the Enterprise and take the
			artifact.
			You have a very bad sense of
			humor, Baran.
			They're not expecting an attack,
			so they won't have their shields
			up... we'll stay just outside
			visual range -- they can't pick us
			up on their long range sensors...
			and then we'll transport a raiding
			party aboard.
			Do you have any idea how many
			security officers they have on a
			ship like that?
			No, I don't...
			... but he does.
			I can get you aboard... and I can
			find that artifact.
			Oh, how convenient... we'll just
			beam you aboard your old ship and
			then hope that you won't change
			your mind and decide to betray us?
			I've already saved your life
			twice, Galen. I'd think you'd
			start to show a little gratitude
			by now.
			Galen, if you're so worried about
			Riker, then you can go along on
			the raid to watch him.
			Agreed.
			Draw weapons and equipment for a
			raiding party of five.
			In case you are thinking of
			betraying us to your friends on
			the Enterprise...
			... you might remember that I can
			still kill you at the first sign
			of trouble.
			I haven't forgotten.
			I have an additional task for
			you... one that will prove your
			loyalty.
			This raid is an opportunity to get
			rid of Galen. Once you've found
			the artifact... kill him.
			I'm sure the health and safety
			inspection won't last much longer.
			In the meantime, I'm glad we have
			this opportunity to get to know
			you. May I ask what business
			you're in?
			I hope we're not causing you too
			much inconvenience... were you on
			a tight schedule?
			Lieutenant Worf has programmed our
			replicators to make a very good
			approximation of Klingon
			bloodwine. I think you will find
			it to your liking.
			Well, that's my third scan and I
			still can't find anything out of
			the ordinary.
			He must be hiding something. We
			should download his computer
			memory and analyze it.
			I'd have a tough time defending
			that as part of a safety
			inspection.
			We could claim that the computer
			was generating abnormal radiation
			signatures...
			Worf, we're on pretty shaky ground
			as it is... we can't just start --
			Don't.
			Watch that door.
			What is going on?
			Keep your mouth shut, Klingon.
			Surprised to see me, Doctor?
			You could say that.
			I decided to make a career
			change...
			It's not in here.
			Where's the artifact?
			I... don't know what you're
			talking about.
			Use your brain. They wouldn't be
			down here searching the shuttle if
			they'd already found it. Koral
			must have it with him.
			Where's the Klingon pilot?
			He's in the Observation Lounge
			with Data and Troi.
			How far is that?
			It's twelve decks away.
			Security will not allow you to get
			that far.
			They won't get the chance. We can
			use the transporter in that
			shuttle and beam directly to the
			Observation Lounge.
			Sorry about this...
			Koral, if you could tell us
			something about the nature of your
			mission --
			What is this?
			Quiet.
			Does he have it?
			This is it.
			Are you sure, Galen?
			Yes, I recognize the inscription
			pattern from the first artifact.
			Commander Riker, by taking this
			action you risk charges of
			assault, theft, piracy, and
			treason.
			Really? Then I guess adding one
			more charge wouldn't hurt.
			Is he dead?
			Yes.
			Good.
			Activate the transporter.
			Good-bye.
			Good-bye.
			Security alert. Emergency medical
			team to the Observation Lounge.
			Data to Bridge, raise shields and
			begin sensor sweeps for the
			mercenary ship.
			Aye, sir.
			He's all right. He's just
			stunned.
			I must admit I am experiencing the
			same sensation.
			This is going to take some time to
			explain...
			Set course three one zero mark two
			one five, warp six.
			Where is it?
			Oh, I do have something else for
			you...
			Tell them what happened, Narik.
			Riker turned on us... he tried to
			kill Galen before we beamed back.
			He might have killed all of us.
			And I believe he was acting on the
			direct orders of Baran.
			You betrayed us.
			I say this has gone on long
			enough. It's time for a new
			commander... someone who will
			lead us to the profits we've been
			promised.
			And who would that be? You,
			Galen?
			He's plotted this all along...
			opposed me at every turn...
			endangered all of us with his
			stubborn refusal to follow orders.
			A refusal to follow your orders...
			the orders of a small man trying
			to fill a role too big for him.
			I have kept this crew alive... I
			am about to bring us more profits
			than any of --
			More promises of riches. More
			excuses for Baran to fill his own
			coffers while the rest of us go
			begging. I say it's time for a
			change. Who's with me?
			It's over, Baran.
			Not quite.
			As long as I have this, I'm still
			in command.
			You can't kill us all... you need
			us to run the ship more than we
			need you to command it.
			I don't need to kill you all...
			just you, Galen. Somehow I think
			that watching you writhe in your
			death throes may change a few
			minds... and a few is all I need.
			What happened?
			I switched our transponder codes.
			It seemed like a prudent, if
			regrettable step.
			Baran was nothing. We have a
			mission to complete...
			... and the crew needs a leader.
			There'll be no more "punishment"
			on this ship. Do your duties and
			I'll see to it that we complete
			our mission... and get our
			payment.
			Remove that.
			Orders?
			Maintain course and speed for now.
			I'm going to find out where and
			when we're supposed to deliver our
			cargo.
			Aye... Captain.
			Worf to Commander Riker. Minister
			Satok of Vulcan Security is
			standing by on a secure channel.
			Put it through in here.
			Greetings, Commander. How may I
			be of service?
			Minister, I wanted to let you know
			that the mercenary ship which has
			been raiding planets in the Taugan
			sector is probably on its way to
			Vulcan right now.
			I do not understand.
			I'm sorry. It's been a difficult
			couple of days.
			I know that one of your operatives
			has been investigating the
			assembly of the psionic resonator
			on a mercenary ship for several
			months. I didn't want someone to
			make a mistake and start firing at
			them when they approach your
			planet.
			Commander, I believe there is a
			problem.
			We have no operative aboard a
			mercenary ship.
			According to Baran's logs, the two
			artifacts are supposed to be
			delivered... to the T'Karath
			Sanctuary on Vulcan.
			I know that place. It was an
			underground stronghold for one of
			the factions during the last civil
			war. It's been abandoned for
			centuries.
			Galen to Bridge. Alter course for
			Vulcan.
			Understood.
			Perhaps you can help me with
			something... I've been able to
			translate most of the writing on
			these pieces...
			For the most part, they're just
			warnings of death and destruction
			for those who oppose the
			resonator...
			But this hieroglyph on the
			anterior has me a bit puzzled.
			This is clearly the Vulcan god of
			war... and this is the god of
			death...
			But if you look closely you can
			see that there is a third symbol
			missing -- which should be on the
			final piece. The odd thing is
			that typically, the gods of war
			and death would stand alone on an
			artifact... they would never be
			combined with a third glyph.
			Fascinating. But I am not an
			archaeological expert.
			Hmmmm. I'm anxious to see the
			final artifact... it may provide
			a new insight into Vulcan
			mythology.
			When we arrive at Vulcan, I will
			take these pieces to a secure
			holding area before going to the
			Sanctuary. I prefer to go
			alone... it will arouse less
			suspicion among the isolationists.
			We shouldn't have any problems
			entering orbit.
			I told Commander Riker to contact
			the Vulcan authorities from the
			Enterprise and warn them of our
			approach.
			I didn't want to risk a
			misunderstanding... someone might
			have mistaken this for an actual
			raid...
			It was a wise precaution.
			Perhaps I should contact the
			Enterprise... have them meet us
			at Vulcan in case these
			isolationists try to escape.
			Your offer is appreciated... but
			our security forces are more than
			adequate.
			I see.
			Are you sure it's wise for you to
			go to the Sanctuary alone? After
			all, they're expecting Baran to
			show up, not you. If I
			accompanied you, it may seem more
			plausible that --
			Captain, I understand your human
			emotional need to be there at the
			final moment... but this is a
			Vulcan matter.
			Of course.
			Thank you.
			We have entered orbit of Vulcan.
			Tallera... I've decided on a
			change of plan. Leave one
			artifact here for now. Take the
			other... and once we have our
			payment in hand, we'll complete
			the delivery.
			That was not the agreement.
			I realize that. But it would be
			safer for all concerned if we kept
			one piece here.
			They will not pay us until they
			get both pieces.
			They've waited a long time for
			this. They won't take any risks
			at this stage. Take the piece and
			beam down.
			That is all I was waiting for.
			Go to the navigational computer
			and check file one-three-seven-slash-omega.
			You'll find a
			message secretly transmitted to
			the Enterprise, containing our
			entire flight plan.
			She's right.
			That message was sent by Galen...
			he's a Starfleet officer.
			Why didn't you tell us before?
			I wasn't sure until he tried to
			stop me from taking the artifacts
			to the surface. Then I knew he
			was intentionally obstructing our
			plans to keep us from being paid.
			Tallera's right, I am a Starfleet
			officer... but what she's not
			telling you is that those
			artifacts in her hand are part of
			an incredibly powerful weapon.
			There's no reward waiting for you
			down on the surface. Tallera will
			take the artifacts and leave you
			here, to be captured by Starfleet.
			I've served on this ship for
			almost a year now... fought by
			your sides... protected you from
			Baran when I could... and now I've
			exposed a spy in our midst.
			I think I've proven my loyalty.
			You know Tallera... you know she's
			a woman of great patience. She's
			bided her time and waited for this
			moment. All she cares about is
			assembling that weapon. If she
			leaves this ship you'll never see
			her again.
			I don't care what it is you want,
			Tallera. I don't care if that's
			a weapon for your private use or
			if you're really just making a
			delivery as planned. All I care
			about is my money.
			So I propose a compromise. Narik
			and I will go with you to the
			surface to guarantee we receive
			payment. After that, you can go
			wherever you want.
			Agreed.
			Bring him as well. We can use him
			as a hostage if Starfleet
			arrives... if not we'll kill him
			on the surface.
			There. Your reward as promised.
			Is it all there?
			No. This is less than half of
			what we were promised.
			Where is the rest of it?
			That is all I could manage. I
			suggest you take it and leave.
			I did not come this far to be
			cheated. I want it all. Now.
			Very well. You will get what you
			deserve.
			Go ahead, Captain. Pick up the
			phaser. See what good it will do.
			You can't win, Tallera. Starfleet
			won't stand by while you tear
			apart one of the founding worlds
			of the Federation.
			How little you understand what you
			are facing, Captain.
			You are used to fighting enemies
			like yourself... people on ships
			with energy weapons, defense
			shields, warp drives... but this
			is unlike anything you have ever
			faced. This is the power of the
			mind.
			Pick up the phaser, Captain.
			Drop your weapons! Do it!
			Make no aggressive movements. The
			resonator amplifys violent
			thoughts and emotions.
			That's why you wanted me to take
			the phaser -- and why you were
			able to kill Narik and Vekor. It
			wasn't until I saw the image on
			the last artifact... that I
			realized what the message on the
			resonator was.
			The third image is the Vulcan
			symbol for peace... that symbol is
			positioned between the symbols for
			war and death.
			It's a warning... that the
			resonator's power can be overcome
			by peace.
			You're about to see how wrong you
			are.
			Clear your minds of all aggressive
			thoughts...
			No...
			Think, Tallera -- two thousand
			years ago, your people were being
			consumed by war... then they found
			the way of peace and logic.
			During the same period, the
			resonator was dismantled... don't
			you see the connection?
			When peace came to Vulcan, the
			resonator became useless. That is
			why it was dismantled.
			You were right... the resonator
			cannot be stopped with phasers or
			shields. But like every other
			form of violence... it can be
			stopped with peace.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 47169.2.
			Security Minister Satok has taken
			Tallera into custody and begun a
			search for the rest of the
			isolationists.
			Once we realized you weren't on
			the mercenary ship, we scanned the
			surface for your neural implant...
			and tracked the signal to the
			cavern.
			What will happen to the resonator?
			Satok assured me that all three
			pieces will be destroyed.
			It is unfortunate that it cannot
			be studied. The resonator is a
			key artifact from a remarkable
			period of history.
			Normally, I would be the first to
			agree with you... but perhaps
			there are some things best left in
			the past.
			What's going to happen to the
			mercenaries?
			They have been detained by the
			Vulcan authorities, for the
			moment.
			But they're also facing charges
			from the Klingons, the
			Cardassians, the Ferengi, and
			about seven other worlds. We
			won't be hearing from them for
			quite some time.
			Number One, set course for
			Starbase two-twenty-seven. I'll
			be on the Bridge shortly.
			Wait a minute... You were declared
			dead, remember? You can't give
			orders around here.
			If we are to adhere to the exact
			letter of Starfleet regulations,
			then technically sir, you have
			been declared a renegade. In
			fact, I believe you are facing
			twelve counts of court martial
			offenses. You cannot give orders
			either.
			Quite right. I'm going to get
			some sleep. In the meantime I
			suggest you escort Commander Riker
			to the brig.
			Yes, sir.
			This way, sir...
			Data, he was just joking... you
			know that, right? Data?
