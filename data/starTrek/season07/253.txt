			Acting Captain's Log,
			Supplemental: The skeleton crew
			left on board the Enterprise is
			unable to help in the search for
			Commander Data. The planet's
			unusual EM field is interfering
			with the ship's sensors, severely
			limiting their effectiveness.
			Without our sensors, we're sitting
			ducks. A Borg ship could be right
			on top of us before we knew it...
			Ensign, we need to modify the
			sensor array to filter out these
			EM pulses. Can you do that?
			Yes, sir.
			I think so.
			What's your name?
			Taitt, sir.
			I don't think I've seen you
			before.
			I was just posted here six weeks
			ago.
			Well, Taitt -- I'll bet you never
			thought you'd be serving as
			Tactical Officer after only six
			weeks.
			No, sir, I sure didn't.
			I think I've filtered out some of
			the sensor noise. I'll bring the
			modifications on line.
			Good work.
			Riker to Enterprise.
			Go ahead, Wil.
			I can't contact the Captain.
			It might just be the interference,
			but I'd like to be sure.
			Understood.
			Enterprise to Captain Picard.
			Crusher to Picard.
			I'm not getting a Com signal from
			anyone on the Captain's team.
			The last time they checked-in they
			were investigating a structure in
			section gamma two-five.
			Sir, I'm picking up a vessel
			closing in on our location.
			Is it a Borg ship?
			It... it seems to match the
			configuration of a ship The
			Enterprise encountered... at
			Ohniaka Three...
			Red Alert. How long before
			they're in weapons range?
			Ahh... about... ninety seconds.
			No -- no, make that seventy
			seconds.
			Crusher to Transporter Room Three.
			Salazar here, sir.
			Start transporting the Away Teams
			off the surface.
			Aye, sir.
			Use the transporters in the cargo
			bays if you have to. I want those
			teams up here as fast as possible.
			Armstrong, you and the others get
			ready to beam up.
			Beverly, Worf and I will stay here
			and look for the Captain's team.
			I'm not going to leave you down
			there --
			Pull as many people off the
			surface as you can and get back to
			the transwarp conduit. The
			Captain's orders were to get the
			Enterprise to Federation space.
			Acknowledged.
			Riker, out.
			Prepare to leave orbit.
			Sir, the Borg ship is powering up
			its forward weapons array.
			They'll be in firing range in...
			in twenty seconds.
			Salazar, how many people are still
			down there?
			Seventy-three, sir.
			Put the Borg ship on screen.
			Should I raise shields, sir?
			Not yet. I want to keep bringing
			people up until the last possible
			second.
			Ten seconds.
			Stand by to raise shields and
			break orbit on my mark.
			Five seconds.
			Mark.
			Shields are down to seventy
			percent.
			Establish a frequency-shift firing
			pattern and return fire.
			Ah... right.
			Direct hit... no damage.
			Helm, set course for the conduit,
			maximum warp.
			The Borg aren't following us, sir.
			Salazar, how many people did we
			leave behind?
			Forty-seven, sir.
			Another minute and we could have
			had them...
			Riker to any team leader.
			Lieutenant Powell here, sir.
			Round up everyone who was left
			behind. Take cover and try to
			avoid any contact with the Borg.
			Aye, sir.
			Riker, out.
			Even if Beverly gets back to
			Federation space, it'll be a few
			days before Starfleet can get any
			ships here... until then, we're
			on our own.
			What do you think of my followers,
			Picard? Impressive, aren't they?
			I'm not particularly impressed.
			You've simply taught them to enjoy
			killing.
			You are wrong, Captain. My
			brother and I serve a much higher
			purpose.
			Data... I can sense feelings in
			you.
			Yes. My brother has made it
			possible.
			He gave you the chip -- the one
			Doctor Soong made for you.
			Oh, no, no. I still have the
			emotional program my father
			designed. I wouldn't want to give
			it up. It's what has given me
			such a strong sense of family --
			an intense desire to re-unite with
			my dear brother.
			Then you're responsible for
			bringing him here.
			He came of his own accord. All I
			had to do was lure the Enterprise
			into investigating those attacks
			we staged. Once the Borg told him
			about my plans, I knew Data would
			want to join me.
			You mean... you attacked those
			outposts... killed all those
			people... just to get Data here
			with you?
			How did he do it, Data? What made
			you decide to come here?
			I am talking to you, Picard. I
			will tell you what you need to
			know.
			You're controlling him. And
			you've corrupted the Borg.
			You simply don't understand.
			You have no idea what has happened
			here. How I found my true
			calling... how the Borg found
			something to believe in.
			I'd like to learn about it. But
			I want Data to tell us.
			I told you -- I will tell you what
			you need to know.
			How do you like that, Data? He
			won't even let you talk.
			Do not try to drive a wedge
			between us, Captain. I am loyal
			to my brother.
			You see, Picard? He's not your
			pawn anymore. I've helped him
			break free --
			-- just as I've helped them.
			Look at them. Look at what I've
			helped them become. They're no
			longer mindless automatons.
			They're passionate. Alive.
			Are you saying you caused them to
			become individuals?
			No. You and your friends did
			that. All I did was clean up the
			mess you made when that Borg you
			befriended returned to his ship.
			Hugh interfaced with the others
			and transferred his sense of
			individuality to them. It almost
			destroyed them.
			Data, do you remember when Hugh
			was on the Enterprise? Do you
			remember what you were like then?
			That doesn't matter.
			It does to me. I want to know
			what's happened to Data.
			What's important is what I've done
			here. I've found my calling,
			Picard. I know now why I was
			created. And no one can ever take
			that away from me.
			Without me, they would have
			perished. When I stumbled on
			their ship, they were lost,
			disoriented -- they had no idea
			how to function as individuals.
			They couldn't even navigate their
			vessel. They had lost their sense
			of purpose.
			I gave them that purpose. And
			they gave me mine.
			The Borg aspire to the perfection
			my Brother and I represent: fully
			artificial life forms. We are
			their future.
			The reign of biological life forms
			is coming to an end. You and
			those like you are obsolete,
			Picard.
			Take them, Brother.
			Still no sign of the structure.
			With all this interference it
			could be a hundred meters away and
			we wouldn't know it.
			This could take hours.
			I am detecting a faint energy
			reading.
			Residual thermal traces... someone
			stopped here...
			The decay rate indicates they were
			human...
			They followed this path...
			You must realize that something
			has happened to you. The Data I
			know would not be a willing party
			to Lore's plan.
			I now realize that my life aboard
			the Enterprise was a waste. My
			quest to become human was
			misguided, an evolutionary step in
			the wrong direction.
			Data, all I'm sensing from you is
			anger... hatred -- have you felt
			any other emotions?
			There are no other emotions.
			What about love... joy?
			Those are words without substance.
			Love is nothing more than the
			absence of hate. Joy is the
			absence of fear.
			Just because you haven't
			experienced certain emotions
			doesn't mean they don't exist..
			Lore is just feeding you the
			negative ones.
			Counselor Troi herself told me
			that feelings are not positive or
			negative, it is how we act on them
			that becomes good or bad.
			Fine. Then what about the things
			Lore is proposing? What about the
			lives that have already been lost?
			You do not understand. In a quest
			such as ours, sacrifices must be
			made. It is regrettable. But the
			greater good must be served.
			Give me your Visor.
			Why?
			Give it to me or I will take it by
			force.
			I am not your puppet anymore.
			Sir, we've reached the coordinates
			of the conduit. The tachyon
			matrix is energized and ready to
			go.
			And Lieutenant Barnaby has
			returned from the surface. He'll
			be relieving me.
			Right. Stand by to trigger the
			conduit.
			Taitt.
			I'd like you to stay on the
			Bridge. I'll need a Science
			Officer at the Aft Station.
			Yes, sir.
			Helm, set a course back to the
			planet.
			I'm not leaving those people
			stranded back there. An emergency
			buoy can transmit a copy of our
			log entries to Starfleet just as
			easily as we can.
			Ensign, prepare a buoy and launch
			it when you're ready.
			Aye, sir.
			Lieutenant, open the conduit.
			Launching the buoy now, sir.
			Lieutenant, scan for any Borg
			ships between here and the planet.
			Sensors detect no vessels.
			We have to assume the ship that
			attacked us is still in orbit.
			How long will we have before they
			can detect us and intercept?
			If their sensors function as well
			as ours -- it could be as little
			as thirty seconds.
			Crusher to Salazar... how long
			will it take to get the rest of
			the crew off the surface?
			One minute should do it.
			We don't have one minute. How
			much can you shave off that?
			If I can get a good lock on them
			quickly... I might be able to do
			it in forty-five or fifty seconds.
			We need to buy ourselves fifteen
			seconds.
			Is there any way we can use the
			planet as a barrier... to keep the
			Borg from realizing we're in
			orbit?
			We can enter orbit while they're
			on the far side of the planet.
			And if we delayed dropping out of
			warp until the last possible
			instant -- we could gain a few
			more seconds.
			If your calculations are even
			slightly off... we'd hit the
			atmosphere...
			Then I'll have to be sure my
			calculations are accurate.
			Let's go for it. Helm, hard
			about.
			Brother!
			Here is the VISOR. May I ask why
			you wanted it?
			I thought it might look good on
			me.
			What do you think?
			Maybe we'd better work on your
			sense of humor, Brother.
			Actually, I was thinking that La
			Forge's implants would make him an
			ideal test subject for my
			experiment.
			All the Borg you have experimented
			on so far have suffered extensive
			brain damage.
			Using the humans to perfect the
			procedure would allow us to
			prevent any further Borg deaths.
			I understand.
			What is it?
			This Borg disconnected himself
			from the others. He would not let
			me hear his thoughts.
			I've asked you all to remain
			linked to Crosis at all times.
			You know that, don't you?
			Yes...
			This is the third time he has
			disabled the link since he was
			brought here. He should die as an
			example to the others.
			No -- please --
			I appreciate your vigilance,
			Crosis. With you monitoring the
			thoughts of the others, I can be
			sure they are not falling into
			confusion.
			But Goval has not been with us
			long. Don't you remember what it
			was like when I first found you?
			How bewildered you were?
			I understand how difficult it is
			for you. How uncertain you feel.
			All these sensations are new --
			and they can be frightening.
			Isn't that right?
			Yes. I -- have doubts...
			Of course you do. That's only
			natural. And no one is going to
			blame you for that.
			But the only way to lose those
			doubts... to keep you from fear
			and confusion... is for you to
			stay linked with the others. So
			their strength and confidence can
			help you.
			I need you, Goval. I need you to
			help me build a future for the
			Borg.
			I can't do it without you. Will
			you help me?
			Yes... I will...
			Then I need you to be strong. I
			need you to be certain in your
			thinking. Will you stay linked to
			your brothers?
			Yes. I understand now.
			Lore must have told Data to take
			my VISOR because he realized I
			could see a carrier wave radiating
			from him.
			A carrier wave... is that how he's
			manipulating Data?
			I think what's happening is that
			Lore is tapping into the chip he
			stole from Doctor Soong. He's
			found a way to transmit part of
			that emotional program to Data.
			But the only emotions Data seems
			to feel are negative.
			I'm sure that's intentional. But
			for those emotions to affect Data,
			Lore would have had to disable his
			ethical program first...
			Can we reactivate it?
			If I could generate a phased
			kedion pulse at the right
			frequency, it would trigger Data's
			subsystems and reboot the program.
			Lore would still be feeding him
			negative emotions, but at least
			Data might listen to us.
			I think it's worth a try.
			So... got any ideas on how we can
			generate a kedion pulse?
			Where are you taking him?
			That's not your concern.
			Data, wait -- let us talk to you --
			Commander, we have found it.
			Hugh... ?
			Why are you here, Commander Riker?
			Hasn't the crew of the Enterprise
			caused enough damage already?
			You blame us -- for what has
			happened to the Borg?
			You gave me a sense of
			individuality -- changed me and
			sent me back to the collective.
			You must have known that change
			would be passed on to others.
			We considered it. We knew it was
			a possibility...
			Then you made it possible for Lore
			to dominate us.
			I do not accept that. Lore is
			only one man. The Borg could have
			stopped him.
			You don't know the condition we
			were in when he found us.
			Before my experience on the
			Enterprise, the Borg were a singleminded
			collective. The voices in
			our heads were smooth and flowing.
			But after I returned, the voices
			began to change. They became
			uneven... discordant.
			For the first time, individual
			Borg had differing ideas about how
			to proceed.
			We couldn't function. Some Borg
			fought each other. Others simply
			shut themselves down. Many
			starved to death.
			And then -- Lore came along.
			You probably can't imagine what it
			is like to be so lost and
			frightened that you will listen to
			any voice which promises change.
			Even if that voice insists on
			controlling you?
			That's what we wanted -- someone
			who could show us a way out of
			confusion. Lore promised clarity
			and purpose.
			In the beginning, he seemed like
			a savior. The promise of becoming
			a superior race -- of becoming
			fully artificial -- was
			compelling. We gladly did
			everything he asked of us.
			But after a while, it became clear
			that Lore had no idea how to keep
			his promise. That's when he began
			talking about the need for us to
			make sacrifices.
			And before we realized it -- this
			was the result.
			What's happened to them?
			Lore began to experiment -- trying
			to re-make us in his image.
			This is the result of my encounter
			with the Enterprise, Commander.
			So you can see I don't
			particularly welcome your presence
			here.
			I'm sorry you feel that way.
			We came here to get our people.
			I don't want to cause you any more
			trouble...
			Tell me... about my friend.
			Friend?
			The human called Geordi.
			I wish I could tell you. We think
			he's being held inside the
			compound.
			I cannot help you... I cannot risk
			our being discovered.
			Will you at least show us how to
			get into the compound?
			These caverns lead to tunnels
			which run beneath the compound.
			Some of them connect with the
			environmental control ducts.
			Show us. If we can determine the
			geography of the compound, we can
			form a rescue plan.
			Data?
			Is somebody there?
			Geordi...
			Captain --
			Shhh. We're getting out of here.
			Hurry. Data was just here; he
			went to get something.
			Too late.
			My Brother suggested that I try to
			develop my sense of humor. What
			do you think?
			I think it needs a little work.
			What's happening?
			I am neutralizing your pain
			receptors.
			What are you going to do to me?
			I am implanting nano-cortical
			fibers in your cerebrum that are
			designed to learn and mimic your
			neural firing patterns.
			Once they are in place, I will
			destroy your existing brain cells
			and see if the artificial neural
			network is able to take over
			cognitive functions.
			Data, listen to me. Lore is
			controlling you -- he's
			transmitting a carrier wave that's
			affecting your positronic matrix.
			If the procedure is successful,
			your cognitive processing
			functions will be considerably
			improved.
			Don't you care that he's
			manipulating you?
			However, there is approximately a
			sixty percent chance that you will
			not survive the procedure.
			I don't much care for those odds.
			They are cause for concern.
			However, since I also have
			Counselor Troi and Captain Picard,
			the odds are that at least one of
			the procedures will be successful.
			Help me!
			He tried to escape -- the force-field
			put him into neural shock.
			If he dies, Lore will blame you.
			See if the corridor's empty.
			Drop it or I will break his neck.
			Take him.
			What have you done to him?
			I will be back for him later.
			Geordi, are you in pain?
			No. I'm a little dizzy, but
			that's all.
			I was able to take part of a
			transceiver from the guard's
			interlink system. It uses some
			kind of phased pulse technology.
			Is there any way we could modify
			it to generate a kedion pulse and
			reboot Data's program?
			It's a possibility.
			See if you can locate the phase
			modulation circuitry.
			I'll watch the door.
			All right, I've found it...
			Good... do you see anything that
			would act as a flux inhibitor?
			Sensors still can't locate the
			Borg ship. I'm trying to filter
			out the interference.
			We'll be within transporter range
			in nineteen seconds.
			I'm starting to get sensor
			resolution...
			There's the ship.
			We'll enter orbit here.
			Helm, new course -- heading zero-five-two
			mark seven.
			Aye, sir.
			Stand by to drop out of warp in...
			eight seconds.
			Once we're in orbit, we should
			have about forty-five seconds
			before they intercept us.
			I hope that's enough time...
			Emergency deceleration in five
			seconds.
			Hold on --
			Report.
			We're in standard orbit, sir. The
			Borg ship is on the planet's far
			side, and is moving to intercept.
			Bridge to Transporter Rooms --
			begin evacuation.
			The Borg will be in weapons range
			in... thirty-two seconds.
			We still can't locate Captain
			Picard's Team... and there's no
			sign of Commander Riker or
			Lieutenant Worf.
			Crusher to Salazar. Report.
			We're pulling the last teams off
			right now. But there are six
			people still unaccounted for.
			Keep trying.
			The Borg ship is powering up its
			weapons array.
			Come on, Chief. It's now or
			never.
			They're preparing to fire.
			Raise shields.
			The port nacelle's been hit.
			Helm, get us out of here.
			We've lost warp engines.
			Evasive maneuvers, full impulse.
			Shields are down to eighty
			percent.
			Fire phasers.
			Direct hit. No damage to the Borg
			ship.
			Shields at seventy-three percent.
			Status of the warp engines?
			Still down. We can't outrun them.
			Helm, set a new course -- heading
			three-four-four mark six. Full
			impulse.
			Sir... that heading takes us
			directly into the sun...
			The databanks should contain
			information about a process called
			metaphasic shielding --
			I know about that research.
			Commander La Forge was developing
			a program that would implement
			metaphasic properties...
			How far along was he?
			The program's in the databanks...
			but it was never tested...
			If we had metaphasic shielding, we
			could enter the sun's corona and
			the Borg ship wouldn't be able to
			follow.
			Can you bring the program on line?
			I can... but we have no way of
			knowing if the shields will hold.
			Sir, hull temperature is rising...
			now at twelve-thousand degrees C.
			Radiation level is nearing ten
			thousand rads.
			Report.
			Shields at sixty-two percent...
			Lieutenant, activate the
			metaphasic program. We don't have
			a choice.
			Aye, sir.
			Hull temperature is critical. We
			can't withstand this heat much
			longer.
			The program is on line. Engaging
			metaphasic shield... now.
			Hull temperature dropping... down
			to seven thousand degrees.
			Maintain course.
			The Borg ship has broken off
			pursuit.
			All stop.
			Sir, the Borg ship is taking up
			position relative to ours.
			They're going to wait for us to
			come out.
			The question is... how long can we
			survive in here?
			I've done everything Geordi said.
			Now to activate it...
			How are we going to know whether
			the pulse reboots Data's ethical
			program?
			We'll only be able to tell by his
			behavior.
			Won't he realize something has
			happened to him?
			I doubt it. It's one program
			among thousands.
			I just hope this force field has
			enough energy to trigger the
			pulse.
			You know, Data -- I've been
			thinking... about some of the
			times we've had together.
			Like that time we went sailing on
			Devala Lake. Remember that?
			I have a complete memory record of
			that day.
			You decided to take a swim... but
			when you jumped out of the boat
			you sank straight to the bottom.
			I did not have enough buoyancy to
			get back to the surface.
			So you had to walk over a
			kilometer along the bottom of the
			lake to get to shore.
			One kilometer, forty-six meters.
			It took two weeks to get the water
			out of your servos...
			I am ready to irradiate your
			existing brain cells.
			Data... if you ever go back to
			being the way you were, you may
			not be able to forgive yourself
			for what you're about to do to me.
			I am getting some anomalous
			readings from your neural net. I
			will have to do further tests
			before I proceed.
			Someone will come and take you
			back to your cell.
			We can use the environmental
			control ducts to get inside the
			compound. They should take us to
			the detention area.
			We'll have to move fast. If we
			have to stun a guard, the other
			Borg will know right away that
			he's been hurt.
			When they realize... your escape
			route may be compromised.
			We'll have to take that chance.
			Good luck, Commander.
			There you are, Brother. Have you
			made any progress with La Forge?
			It is too early to tell if the
			nano-cortical fibers have
			performed their function.
			I suspect none of the humans will
			survive the process... but it's
			their own fault, isn't it? They
			should never have come here. What
			were they thinking?
			They came looking for me.
			Humans are so sentimental.
			I betrayed them. If they die...
			I am responsible.
			Why are you talking like this? Is
			something wrong with your
			programming? Perhaps I should
			check your systems.
			I do not want you to check my
			systems. I must resolve these
			issues myself.
			I think I've made a mistake. I
			don't believe you can tolerate the
			amount of emotion I've been giving
			you.
			Perhaps I should cut back a
			little...
			How's that?
			I... do not like it...
			Ah. Then you prefer having more
			emotions... ?
			Yes...
			They give you pleasure.
			Yes. Please... I want more...
			All right. For now, a little
			more.
			Thank you...
			Don't mention it. I just hope
			this has helped clarify things for
			you.
			I am concerned about my brother,
			Crosis. I don't believe he really
			wants to be a part of our great
			future.
			Sir, the metaphasic shielding is
			losing integrity.
			Can you stabilize it?
			No... we won't be able to stay in
			here more than another three or
			four minutes.
			Do we have warp engines yet?
			The last estimate was another half
			hour.
			Sir?
			I think I have an idea...
			I think... it's possible we could
			induce a solar fusion eruption...
			that would destroy the Borg ship.
			What?
			We'd need to direct a highly
			energetic particle beam onto the
			sun's surface... it should
			produce a superfluid gas eruption.
			If we target the right spot -- the
			eruption would envelop the Borg
			ship.
			How do you know this'll work?
			I did my senior honors thesis on
			solar dynamics.
			Excuse me, sir, but this isn't the
			Academy. And a student thesis is
			a long way from a workable plan.
			I've already configured the
			tractor emitters to create the
			particle beam... and I've located
			the target point on the surface...
			If her calculations are off, the
			eruption could encompass us.
			Well. I'll just have to make sure
			my calculations are accurate.
			Let's do it.
			Yes, sir.
			The target area on the photosphere
			is destabilizing... pressure wave
			expansion is accelerating...
			Sub-surface fusion has been
			initiated...
			There's an eruption forming on the
			surface.
			She did it. The Borg ship has
			been destroyed.
			Helm, take us back to the planet,
			full impulse.
			You're killing him. He won't
			survive another session.
			I did not come for him -- I came
			for you.
			... It's not too late. If you
			remove the fibers, Geordi might
			recover.
			That will not be possible.
			Why? Because Lore says so?
			It is for the greater good.
			Good? Aren't good and bad, right
			and wrong, functions of your
			ethical program?
			That is correct.
			What does that program tell you
			about what you're doing to Geordi,
			about what you and Lore are doing
			to the Borg?
			It tells you these things are
			wrong, doesn't it?
			How can actions that are wrong
			lead to a "greater good"?
			You are attempting to confuse me.
			No, Data. You're not confused;
			you're sensing the truth. Your
			ethical program is fighting the
			negative emotions Lore is sending
			you.
			There you are, Captain. Thank you
			for joining us. You're going to
			help me in a most important
			ceremony.
			Where's the Captain?
			Data took him away.
			There's not much time.
			Can he walk?
			He'll need help.
			There's an air duct in the
			corridor that connects to a tunnel
			underneath the compound. You take
			Geordi and we'll look for the
			Captain.
			It's time to put your doubts
			aside, Brother. It's time to
			close the door on your past and
			commit yourself to the great work
			that lies ahead of us.
			I need to know that I can count on
			you.
			As proof, I want you to kill
			Captain Picard.
			No... It would be wrong.
			I didn't think you'd be able to do
			it. You've spent too many years
			among humans.
			Hold him.
			I've asked many sacrifices of you --
			sacrifices I knew were necessary
			in order to build a better future.
			I want you to know that I ask no
			more of you than I am prepared to
			give myself. I am willing to make
			the greatest sacrifice of all --
			my own dear brother.
			Good bye, Data.
			No --
			Lore...
			Be careful with that, Brother.
			Somebody could get hurt.
			What are you doing?
			I have a way out of here. I'm
			willing to forget about what
			happened back there and take you
			with me.
			We don't need anyone else. We're
			Brothers.
			I'll give you the chip our father
			made. It contains more than just
			emotions -- it has memories.
			Memories our Father wanted you to
			have.
			I am going to deactivate you now.
			Without me, you will never feel
			emotion again.
			You leave me no other choice.
			Good bye, Lore.
			I... love you... Brother...
			What about Geordi and Troi?
			The Enterprise is in orbit.
			They've been beamed aboard.
			Lore is no longer functioning.
			He must be disassembled so that he
			is never again a threat.
			It's good to have you back, Data.
			Thank you, sir.
			What made you change your mind?
			Perhaps my encounter with the
			Enterprise affected me more than
			I realized...
			What will you do now?
			I don't know. We can't go back to
			the Borg collective...
			And we no longer have a leader
			here...
			I'm not sure that's true.
			Perhaps in time... we can learn to
			function as individuals -- and
			work together as a group.
			Good luck, Hugh.
			Good bye.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47025.4.
			We have returned to Federation
			Space and are en route to Starbase
			two-nine-five. Mister La Forge
			remains under Doctor Crusher's
			care.
			Enter.
			Hi, Data.
			I just wanted to let you know that
			Doctor Crusher says I'll be able
			to return to duty soon.
			I am glad that the injuries I
			inflicted on you are not
			permanent.
			What's that?
			This is the chip my Father created
			for me so that I could experience
			emotions. I had it removed from
			Lore's body before he was
			dismantled.
			Does it still work?
			No. I am pleased to say that it
			was damaged when I was forced to
			fire on Lore.
			Pleased? Data, you've wanted
			emotions all your life.
			Yes. But emotions were
			responsible for what I did to you.
			I would never risk letting
			something like that happen again.
			My friendship with you is too
			important to me.
			I wouldn't be much of a friend to
			you if I let you give up on a life-long
			dream.
			Who knows? Maybe someday we can
			repair this.
