			Deanna Troi Personal Log: Stardate
			47611.2. I have spent the last
			three days attending a reunion of
			my graduating class at the Carvin
			Institute for Psychological
			Studies. It was a very... thought-provoking
			experience.
			Send a message to Commander Data
			and inform him of our delay.
			Aye, sir.
			Deanna... welcome back.
			Thank you. I just wanted to
			report in. I didn't expect to
			find anyone up except Data.
			Data's away on assignment. A
			Federation deep space probe went
			off course and crashed on Barkon
			Four. Some of the material in the
			casing is radioactive, so Data was
			sent to recover it before it
			contaminates the biosphere.
			Isn't Barkon Four inhabited?
			There's a pre-industrial society,
			but the probe crashed over a
			hundred kilometers from the
			nearest settlement. Data won't
			have to make contact with any of
			the Barkonians.
			How was the reunion?
			Fine. It was good to see some old
			friends... I'd fallen out of touch
			with most of them.
			It was interesting to see the
			different paths some of their
			lives have taken...
			Beverly... you don't usually stand
			a watch on the Bridge even when
			Data's not here... why this time?
			I volunteered tonight. I like to
			get in a little Bridge time now
			and then... stay on top of
			operations... tactical
			procedures...
			And the truth is... I like it.
			Not every doctor gets to command
			a starship... even if it is only
			the night shift.
			May I ask you a personal
			question... what made you decide
			to become a commander?
			I mean, you didn't need the rank
			in order to be Chief Medical
			Officer... so why put yourself
			through all the extra work?
			I don't know... I never gave much
			thought to my rank for a long
			time... it seemed pretty trivial
			compared to being a doctor.
			But then, about eight years ago,
			I began to feel like I wanted
			to... stretch myself a little.
			Commander... there's been no
			response from Commander Data to
			our signal.
			Continue sending him updates on
			our schedule.
			Aye, sir.
			Is something wrong?
			No. I wanted to let Data know
			that we'll have to delay picking
			him up for a couple of days. We
			have orders to rendezvous with the
			Lexington and take medical
			supplies to the Taranko Colony.
			But he's not responding.
			Geordi said the radiation from the
			probe would probably interfere
			with communications... I just
			thought I'd try anyway. I'm sure
			he's fine... it's a very routine
			mission.
			... so when you return from school
			tonight, I'll be meeting with the
			Village Elders.
			Again?
			Gia...
			I know. I know you're the
			magistrate and you have a lot of
			work to do.
			But it seems like you're always in
			some meeting or --
			Gia, go home. Now.
			Who are you? What do you want?
			Wayuman... whaaaa... yuuuu...
			waaaant... what d'yuuuu... what
			you want... what do you want?
			What's wrong with you?
			Runnnn... rung... wrong wrong
			wrong... what is...
			What is wrong with you?
			There's nothing wrong with me.
			Who are you? What is your name?
			Your name? Can you understand me?
			My name is Garvin.
			My name is Garvin?
			I thought I told you to go home.
			I know...
			I do not know my name.
			What?
			You asked... if I knew my name.
			I do not.
			Well... at least you seem to be
			understanding a little more.
			Yes. It is becoming... easier.
			Ask him where he's from, Father.
			Gia, go on to school. I'll deal
			with the stranger.
			Yes, Father.
			Good-bye.
			Good-bye.
			Your eyes and skin look so...
			strange. And your clothes... you
			look like you've been in some kind
			of accident.
			I do not remember being in an
			accident.
			But then, I do not remember very
			much at all.
			What do you remember?
			I walked here... from the
			mountains.
			The mountains? The mountains are
			over two hundred seltons from
			here.
			I do have a clear memory of my
			journey. It began on a steep path
			in the mountains... near a large
			waterfall with two jagged
			promontories.
			There are several large waterfalls
			up in those mountains...
			What do you remember before that?
			I have no prior memories.
			Do you know what that is?
			No.
			May I?
			May I have it?
			Yes.
			There might be something in here
			that can tell us who you are.
			I wonder what these markings
			mean...
			"Radioactive."
			What?
			That is what is written on the
			container.
			You can read this language?
			Evidently.
			Radioactive... what does that
			mean?
			I do not know. Perhaps it is my
			name.
			I've never heard of a name like
			that... you must come from a very
			distant place.
			Is that supposed to be a question?
			Well, if you're asking me if I
			liked what you were playing, then
			the answer is yes.
			And I think this is a much better
			way of communicating for you.
			It's much less... confusing than
			when you try to speak normally.
			I can always count on the ship's
			Counselor to boost my self-image.
			Glad to be of service.
			Did you come here for something in
			particular, or just for some
			general Riker-bashing?
			I'd actually like your opinion on
			something.
			I've been thinking about taking
			the Bridge Officer's test and
			becoming a full commander.
			What brought this up?
			A lot of things... working on last
			month's personnel review...
			talking with Beverly about her
			experiences... going to my class
			reunion...
			Ah, the class reunion... saw a few
			old friends who'd taken the
			test... ?
			All right, I'll admit that was a
			catalyst. But I can honestly say
			it's something I have thought
			about off and on over the past two
			years.
			Why the past two years?
			Do you remember when the
			Enterprise hit that quantum
			filament... and I was left in
			command on the Bridge?
			I remember...
			When it happened, I felt
			overwhelmed... but when it was
			over...
			I realized that a part of me
			missed it... not the actual
			disaster, but the experience of
			being in command. When I was on
			the Bridge, I felt like I was
			exploring a new side of myself.
			I don't want to give up counseling
			by any means... but I would like
			to... stretch myself a little.
			Deanna, if you want to take the
			Bridge Officer's test, you have my
			complete support. But as first
			officer, I'll be judging your
			performance.
			And I want you to know... I'm a
			pretty hard judge.
			I'm a pretty good student.
			We'll start tomorrow -- oh eight
			hundred hours.
			Hmmmm. Remarkable set of teeth...
			no sign of decay...
			Breath smells like...
			Well, it doesn't have any smell,
			actually.
			You can close your mouth.
			Heartbeat sounds a little odd...
			but seems regular.
			Skin is... clammy. But you say
			you feel fine?
			That is correct.
			No headaches... palpitations...
			sluggishness... indigestion...
			No. However, I cannot have
			indigestion since I have not
			eaten.
			When was your last meal?
			I do not know.
			Ah. Malnutrition. You should try
			to eat something that will build
			strength and return your
			vitality... lots of meat...
			butter... cheese... that should
			be a start.
			What about his eyes and his skin?
			They're so... odd.
			Oh, quite so, quite so. I'm sure
			my grandmother would have called
			our friend here a... demon or
			spirit or some kind of monster.
			But current scientific methodology
			allows us to dismiss such
			ridiculous superstition and
			concentrate on scientific reality.
			Then what do you believe I am?
			You are an ice-man.
			Ice-man?
			Yes. You probably come from a
			race of people who live in the
			snow and ice of the Vellorian
			mountains. Your skin and eye
			coloration are most likely a
			result of prolonged exposure to
			the harsh winter conditions.
			Then I am not ill?
			Other than your memory loss, you
			don't have symptoms of any illness
			that I'm familiar with. No, I'd
			say you're an ice-man.
			Get something to eat and have a
			good night's sleep. I'll come
			back tomorrow to see if your
			memory has begun to return.
			Thank you.
			Hello, Gia.
			Hello.
			What did Talur say about him? Is
			he sick?
			Not exactly. She said he's lost
			his memory, but seems to be fine
			otherwise. Talur thinks he is
			from a race that lives in the
			mountains.
			I am an ice-man.
			We'll have to call you something
			besides Ice-man until your memory
			returns. What was the word on the
			container?
			Radioactive.
			Mister Radioactive... ?
			I don't like that name.
			Let's call him Jayden.
			What do you think of that?
			It is acceptable. What is the
			origin of that name?
			It's from a story. Jayden was a
			boy who looked different from
			everyone else. The other children
			were mean to him and made fun of
			him, but Jayden never got angry.
			It turned out that he was really
			a handsome nobleman who had been
			put under the spell of a demon and--
			That can wait until later, Gia.
			Right now, we should clean him up
			and get him something decent to
			wear. Run upstairs and get some
			of my old clothes for him.
			Yes, Father.
			I wonder if Skoran could tell us
			something about this metal of
			yours...
			You. Ice-man, where did you find
			this?
			I do not know.
			I told you, he's lost his
			memory... and we're calling him
			Jayden for now.
			Jayden, huh?
			The metal is slightly warm...
			All the fragments are like that.
			Hmmmm.
			It's obviously been tempered and
			milled... but the lusterous
			quality of the metal is so pure...
			this wasn't made in any forge I've
			ever seen.
			Will you sell them?
			You want them?
			The metal's malleable enough to
			make some jewelry.
			They belong to Jayden.
			Do you want to sell them? You are
			going to need money.
			You may be right. But I do not
			wish to sell all the fragments.
			They could provide a clue to my
			identity.
			I'll give you twenty doraks for
			half the lot.
			Agreed.
			My leg! Get it off! Get it off!
			We need a lever.
			It will be all right. Don't
			struggle it will only...
			Jayden... put it down.
			I believe the support structure of
			the anvil collapsed because some
			of the wood had rotted.
			Did I do something wrong, Garvin?
			No... just unexpected.
			It's perfectly understandable.
			Your people probably all have
			great strength... it would allow
			them to fight off the ferocious
			creatures that live in the
			Vellorian Mountains.
			You have told me no one from the
			village has ever been to the
			Vellorian Mountains. How do you
			know there are... ferocious
			creatures there?
			It is... a well-known fact.
			But no one has actually seen one?
			Not to my knowledge...
			In the absence of empirical data
			on these creatures, how can you
			support your theory about the
			nature of my strength?
			You certainly have a lot of
			questions, Jayden. I'm sure that
			once your memory returns, a great
			many things will become clear to
			you.
			Father... are you all right?
			I've been... tired since this
			afternoon. I'm sure it's nothing.
			You feel slightly warm... some
			fresh air and a brisk walk will do
			you good.
			That sounds like a good idea.
			I'll be back soon.
			You didn't like it?
			I neither liked nor disliked the
			food. I simply had no appetite.
			Father's cooking isn't as good as
			mother's. He tries, though.
			Where is your mother?
			She died about a year ago.
			Father says that she went to a...
			beautiful place where everything
			is peaceful... where everyone
			loves each other... and no one
			ever gets sick.
			Do you think there's really a
			place like that?
			Yes. I do.
			We've just lost contact with
			everything above deck twenty-one...
			including the Bridge.
			There is something wrong with one
			of the anti-matter containment
			units. The magnetic field is
			starting to fluctuate.
			Switch to auxiliary control.
			Auxiliary control is not on-line.
			We are starting to lose
			containment on anti-matter storage
			unit three.
			All right... then switch the EM
			power inverter to the lateral...
			no, wait use the neodyne relay.
			Commander, the neodyne relay isn't
			holding. Ten seconds to
			containment failure.
			Computer: Emergency procedure.
			Eject anti-matter storage unit
			three. Authorization: Troi omega
			omega three one.
			Unable to comply. All power to
			ejection systems has been
			terminated.
			Commander, the unit's beginning to--
			Congratulations. You just
			destroyed the Enterprise.
			Thanks for the encouragement.
			Don't feel bad. You passed
			everything else -- diplomatic law,
			first contact procedures, Bridge
			operations... but, the
			Engineering Qualification is one
			of the toughest parts of the test.
			So what did I do wrong?
			I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
			Why not? What kind of test is
			this?
			It's the kind of test you'll have
			to take again if you want to be a
			Bridge Officer. And next time,
			the problem won't be so easy, so
			you better study up on emergency
			procedures.
			How am I supposed to study if you
			won't tell me what I did wrong?
			I don't know. You'll have to
			figure that out too.
			Fire, rock, sky, and water are the
			basic elements of the universe.
			They can be found in every object,
			every person, every animal --
			everything.
			The rock in this wood can be felt
			by its weight and by its hardness.
			If we expose the wood to flame...
			We can encourage the fire in the
			wood to show itself.
			We also see smoke, which is a part
			of the sky. But, the water in
			wood is very difficult to see.
			Sometimes the basic elements can
			be hidden deep within objects, but
			all four elements are always
			there.
			Yes, Jayden?
			I do not believe that is correct.
			Oh?
			I believe you are reasoning by
			analogy -- classifying objects and
			phenomena according to superficial
			observation rather than by
			empirical evidence.
			For example, wood does not contain
			fire simply because it is
			combustible. Nor does it contain
			rock simply because it is heavy.
			Wood, like any complex organic
			form, is composed of thousands of
			different chemical compounds, none
			of which is fire.
			Jayden, that will be enough.
			As I told you earlier, our friend
			Jayden has lost much of his
			memory. So don't put too much
			faith in his... ideas.
			I think that will be all for
			today, class. I'll see you
			tomorrow. Be sure to practice
			your arithmetic and spelling
			tonight.
			Are you all right?
			Yes. But I do not agree with
			Talur's assessment. Although I do
			have... gaps in my memory, I know
			that fire is not an element.
			That is not what you promised me!
			You're getting old, Garvin. I
			offered fifteen for the metal and
			I've given it to you. No more.
			We agreed on twenty.
			Garvin is correct. You did agree
			on twenty.
			Stay out of this, Ice-man. Your
			memory's not very reliable.
			Father! Father, what's wrong?
			I don't know... I feel... very
			weak suddenly.
			You've got a fever.
			We should get him home.
			What's wrong with him?
			I suspect that he --
			I don't know. I've never
			encountered anything like this
			before.
			These lesions look like burn
			marks.
			The fluids in his body have been
			overheated... that would explain
			the fever and the burning skin.
			Keep him cool, let plenty of fresh
			air into the house...
			... and give him these herbs. That
			should bring his fluidic
			temperature down and allow this to
			pass.
			I understand.
			With an increased focal length and
			an achromatic objective lens this
			instrument will have a higher
			effective magnification.
			I'll be back tomorrow to check on
			you.
			Thank you.
			Garvin, with your permission, I
			would like to begin my own...
			investigation regarding the cause
			of your illness.
			Go ahead.
			Gia, I would like you to accompany
			me to the village. I will need
			some supplies.
			What are you going to do with all
			this?
			I will use these materials to make
			the laboratory equipment I need to
			research your father's illness.
			Do you think you can help him?
			I do not know. First, I must
			isolate the cause of the --
			There he is!
			It's his fault! None of us were
			sick before he came to the
			village!
			Am I to understand that Garvin's
			illness has spread?
			That's right -- and you're the
			cause.
			That's not true!
			I think we should leave, Gia.
			That's it, leave! Get out of
			here! Go back where you came
			from!
			Jayden... what are you doing?
			I am studying tissue samples from
			Garvin and Gia in an attempt to
			isolate the cause of the illness.
			Gia?
			Yes. She is also beginning to
			show signs of the illness.
			What is that?
			It is a magnifying device based on
			your hand-held instrument. I have
			refined the design to increase the
			magnification level.
			May I?
			Of course.
			How strong is the magnification?
			Objects appear approximately five
			hundred times their normal size.
			As you can see, the cellular
			damage is quite extensive.
			However, based on the interstitial
			transparency and membrane
			integrity, I do not believe this
			is an infection or any form of
			communicable disease.
			I see...
			At the moment, I am looking for a
			common experience or event that
			Garvin, Skoran, and Gia might have
			shared that could have a causal
			relationship to their illness.
			Well... they've all been here in
			the village for many years. I'm
			sure there have been many common
			experiences.
			Yes, but since this illness struck
			all three of them in a relatively
			short period of time, it is
			reasonable to assume that the
			experience would be recent and
			unusual.
			Actually Jayden... encountering
			you has been the most unusual
			experience that they've all shared
			recently.
			I am aware of that. And I am open
			to the possibility that I am in
			some way the causal factor. But
			since you have had a great deal of
			contact with me and have shown no
			sign of the sickness, I tend to
			discount myself as a likely
			candidate.
			Still... it does seem to be more
			than a coincidence that shortly
			after you arrived, people started
			to become ill.
			I agree.
			Jayden... I tried to give Father
			the broth... but he won't eat...
			You have the fever. You should be
			in bed.
			I'm all right. Father needs me.
			I believe Talur is correct. You
			should rest. I will attend to
			your father.
			Gia.
			When did you begin wearing that
			pendant?
			Two days ago. Father bought it
			from Skoran. Why?
			May I see it?
			This was made from one of the
			metal fragments I sold to
			Skoran...
			... the aft secondary plasma vent
			has a... triple redundant by-pass...
			that means the primary
			access junction would be routed...
			Come in.
			... would be routed through the
			port transducer matrix...
			Here to give me more...
			encouragement?
			No... actually I'm here to tell
			you that I've decided to cancel
			the rest of your test.
			What?
			I'm cancelling the test.
			For a moment Troi is too stunned to say anything...
			then she puts down the PADD and gives him an icy look.
			May I ask why?
			You've taken the Engineering
			Qualification three times now...
			and you're no closer to passing.
			Then I'll take it four times or
			fourteen times or however many
			times are necessary for me to get
			it right.
			Deanna... this is nothing
			personal... but not everyone is
			cut out to be a Bridge Officer.
			I don't think this is for you.
			Why? Because I'm not the most
			technically-minded person on the
			ship? I may have trouble telling
			the difference between a plasma
			conduit and a phase inducer, but
			there's more to being a bridge
			officer than just memorizing
			technical manuals.
			That's right, there is. But even
			if you spend the next month
			memorizing every technical manual
			in the computer, I still don't
			think you'll pass the test.
			Tell me one thing... is there
			really a solution? Or is this
			simply a test of my ability to
			handle a no-win situation?
			There is a solution.
			Then give me time to find it.
			I can't.
			As much as I care about you, my
			first duty is to the ship. I
			can't let anyone serve as a Bridge
			Officer who isn't qualified. I'm
			sorry.
			"My first duty is to the ship... "
			Computer, load Bridge Officer's
			Test, program Engineering
			Qualification Section One.
			Ready.
			Run program.
			The control system for the primary
			containment field is not
			functioning.
			Something's severed the ODN
			conduit between here and the antimatter
			storage deck.
			Geordi... could you repair the ODN
			conduit if you went into that
			crawlway?
			Sir. That crawlway is in a warp
			plasma shaft. He would never
			survive the radiation.
			I know that. Geordi, could you
			repair the conduit?
			I... think so.
			Then do it.
			That's an order.
			Aye, sir.
			End program.
			Something told me you wouldn't let
			this go.
			Congratulations. You passed.
			That's what this was all about,
			wasn't it? To see if I could
			order someone to their death.
			That's right.
			I always knew that was part of
			being in command... I thought I
			was prepared for it... but when
			the moment came, I hesitated. It
			took me four times to realize that
			was the answer.
			Maybe you were right. Maybe I'm
			not cut out for this.
			You did exactly what you needed to
			do. You tried every
			alternative... looked at all the
			options, and in the end you made
			the hard choice.
			Come on, let's get out of here...
			Commander.
			Data is hard at work in his "lab" in the dining room.
			Talur is standing nearby, looking on in fascination as
			Data sets up an experiment. Data is holding a cloth
			SCREEN about one foot square.
			I have coated this piece of cloth
			with the liquid which is used in
			lamps.
			You can see that the cloth becomes
			luminescent when exposed to an
			energy source.
			Where is this pattern of light
			coming from?
			I believe a stream of particles is
			emanating from the metallic
			pendant and hitting the cloth.
			I don't see any... particles
			coming from the pendant.
			It would appear that the container
			is constructed from a material
			which can block or absorb the
			particles coming from the metal.
			It's... a trick...
			No. It is empirical data. I
			believe that the fragments were
			originally placed in this
			container to protect people from
			accidental exposure.
			The word "radioactive" may be a
			warning about the dangerous nature
			of the metal.
			All right... let's say for the
			moment that you're right and there
			are... invisible particles coming
			from this metal. What should we
			do?
			I will continue with my
			experiments. I would like you to
			gather all the pieces of metal in
			the village. Put them back in
			this container.
			All right.
			But when I return, I'll want a
			more thorough explanation of all
			this. I want to examine your data
			in detail.
			Of course.
			There you are...
			You're the cause of all this, Iceman.
			If you are referring to the
			illness, you are partially
			correct, but it is more complex
			than that. You see, the metal
			fragments that --
			What... what are you?
			I do not know.
			I saw it with my own eyes. He is
			not a person, he is some kind
			of... creature.
			It's not true, Father.
			We have to find him and stop him
			before he kills us all.
			I don't... not Jayden... he
			wouldn't try to hurt... us...
			Come on.
			Let him rest for now.
			You should rest as well. Exerting
			yourself will only make you
			sicker.
			I'll be back.
			Gia?
			Jayden. Everyone's looking for
			you. Skoran said that you're some
			kind of creature.
			I do not know what I am. But I am
			not like you.
			I know... you're an Ice-man. We
			talked about that...
			No. I am not...
			Jayden... why are you wearing that
			scarf?
			I do not wish to scare you.
			I won't be afraid. Take it off.
			Please. I have to see.
			I understand your reaction. I
			must admit, I do not know what I
			am.
			But I do not wish to harm you.
			You or Garvin or anyone else. I
			only wish to help... to find a
			cure for the illness. I was
			getting very close. I need to
			continue my work, but it will take
			time. How long will it be until
			Skoran and the others return?
			I don't know... they're out
			looking for you.
			Then I must hurry.
			Gia... I believe I have found the
			answer.
			You... you found a cure?
			I believe so.
			I tested this medicine on skin
			samples from your father. They
			showed improvement, so I gave him
			a spoonful. He is now recovering.
			What kind of medicine is it?
			A compound I made which will
			neutralize the particles that are
			making you ill.
			Swallow this.
			I am sorry that I did not have
			time to create a more palatable
			flavor.
			That's all right... it's no worse.
			than... grandmother's soup.
			I must administer this to everyone
			in the village, but I do not think
			they will trust me after what
			happened with Skoran.
			I could... tell them...
			I am afraid they will not believe
			you either.
			Gia, is the well in the town
			square the only source of water
			for this village?
			Well... ?
			This is very important. Are there
			any other sources of fresh water
			near the village?
			No... the nearest river is... two
			days away...
			Then I will put the compound into
			the well water. It will be
			diluted, but it should still have
			enough potency to work.
			The compound... the well...
			There he is!
			You see? It's just as I said...
			I only wish to help you...
			This is how you've helped us... by
			bringing this plague...
			... tried to kill us all... but you
			won't succeed... I won't let you!
			Excuse me. We're looking for a
			friend of ours. He may have
			wandered into your village a few
			days ago.
			You'd remember him... his
			appearance would have been very...
			strange. Pale skin, gold eyes...
			He was your friend?
			Yes. You know him?
			Where is he?
			I don't understand.
			We didn't know his real name, so
			we called him Jayden.
			Are you saying... he's dead?
			They killed him because they were
			afraid of him.. But he saved all
			of us from the sickness.
			The sickness?
			There were these pieces of
			metal... they made everyone sick.
			But Jayden put something in the
			water... and now everyone's
			better.
			What happened to these... pieces
			of metal?
			We buried them out in the forest.
			What was his real name?
			Data.
			Data.
			He was my friend too.
			It's Data all right... he's buried
			about two meters down. He's been
			deactivated... I can't tell how
			bad the damage is.
			We can beam him and the probe
			fragments up to the ship and no
			one will know.
			Positronic net is on-line... sub-processor
			relays in place... neuro-electrical
			systems enabled.
			Data... are you all right?
			I do not know. I am... surprised
			to find myself here. I thought I
			was on Barkon Four.
			What's the last thing you
			remember?
			I had located the crashed
			Federation probe and collected the
			radioactive fragments. I was
			attempting to download the sensor
			logs from the probe's on board
			computer when there was a... power
			surge. I believe the surge
			overloaded my positronic matrix.
			After that... I have no memory
			until this moment.
			But it would appear that I had...
			an interesting time.
			We don't know much about what
			happened either... except you
			apparently saved an entire village
			from radiation poisoning...
			And you were a very special friend
			to a little girl.
			If you'll excuse me, I have the
			Bridge for this watch.
			Counselor, have you been promoted
			during my absence?
			That's right.
			Which means you can call me "sir"
			from now on.
			Yes, sir.
