			I don't know why they have to do
			this every year. In fact, I
			thought last year the teachers
			agreed not to do this anymore.
			Captain Picard Day is one of the
			children's favorite school
			activities. They look forward to
			it all year.
			Why does it have to be me?
			You're the Captain... children
			look up to you... you're a role
			model for them.
			Their perception of me is a
			little... exaggerated.
			"I don't know... I think this
			bears a certain resemblance.
			Wouldn't you agree, Number One?"
			Don't you have something else to
			do?
			I'll be on the Bridge.
			The finalists will be here in half
			an hour. You have to pick first,
			second and third place and four
			honorable mentions.
			Worf to Captain. Incoming
			transmission from Admiral
			Blackwell. It is coded priority
			one.
			Put it through.
			Excuse me, Counselor.
			Admiral.
			Captain. What is your status?
			We're conducting an energy output
			study of the Mekoria Quasar. All
			systems normal, the ship is fully
			operational.
			Good. I'm postponing the quasar
			study for the moment. The
			Enterprise is to rendezvous with
			the starship Crazy Horse in sector
			one-six-zero-seven immediately.
			You're authorized to exceed warp
			speed limitations for the duration
			of this assignment.
			I understand. What is our
			assignment?
			I'd prefer not to discuss it over
			subspace channels. The Crazy
			Horse will be carrying someone
			from Starfleet Intelligence...
			he'll brief you when he arrives.
			Very well.
			"Captain Picard Day?"
			Oh... yes. It's for the
			children... I'm a... role model.
			I'm sure you are. Starfleet out.
			So who won the contest?
			Paul Menegay -- seven years old.
			He did an interesting clay
			sculpture of my head.
			Is that the lumpy one with the
			orange skin?
			Yes.
			Oh, you'll be interested to know
			that I've arranged for a Commander
			Riker day next month. I'm even
			considering making an entry
			myself.
			Great.
			Energize.
			Wil. Bet you never thought you'd
			see me again.
			It's... good to see you, sir.
			Sure it is. You look like you're
			about to faint.
			No... it's just been so long
			and...
			I'm sorry. Captain Jean-Luc
			Picard, Admiral Erik Pressman.
			Pressman? Oh, of course. You
			were Wil's first commanding
			officer... on the Pegasus.
			That's right. As a matter of
			fact, it's the Pegasus which has
			brought me here.
			Sir?
			The Pegasus is still out there,
			Wil. The Romulans found her.
			As some of you may know, the
			starship Pegasus was lost in this
			sector twelve years ago along with
			most of its crew. I was the
			captain and Commander Riker here
			was my helmsman.
			I remember reading about it. The
			ship was destroyed by a... warp
			core breach as I recall.
			That's right. The Captain and I,
			along with seven others managed to
			get to an escape pod before the
			breach became critical.
			From space, we saw what appeared
			to be a matter/anti-matter
			explosion which vaporized the
			ship.
			No wreckage was ever found, so
			Starfleet officially listed the
			ship as destroyed.
			However, all that changed three
			days ago. Starfleet Intelligence
			has an operative in the Romulan
			High Command. He sent us a
			message that a Romulan warbird had
			located a piece of debris in the
			Devolin system which was
			positively identified as being
			from the Pegasus. The Warbird was
			then ordered to locate the rest of
			the ship, if possible, and retrieve
			it.
			Why would the Romulans try to
			salvage pieces of a twelve year-old
			starship?
			The Pegasus was a prototype...
			experimental engine... new weapon
			systems... some of our designs
			were even used in constructing the
			Enterprise. There're a lot of
			things on board the Romulans would
			love to get their hands on.
			What are our orders?
			We have to find the ship before
			the Romulans do... salvage it if
			possible... destroy it if
			necessary. You'll command the
			Enterprise while I remain in
			overall command of the mission.
			We'll need metallurgical and
			chromographic specs on the Pegasus
			in order to set up the proper
			search parameters.
			I'll make the appropriate
			information available to you.
			Very well.
			Set course for the Devolin system.
			Aye, sir.
			We are approaching the Devolin
			system, Captain.
			Any sign of the Romulans?
			No, sir.
			Oh, they're out there... they're
			just waiting to see what you're
			going to do.
			Mister La Forge?
			There's an awful lot of ionizing
			radiation in this system, Captain.
			That, combined with the sheer
			amount of rock is going to slow
			down our search.
			How slow?
			Well, I'd say at least--
			Sir. Romulan Warbird decloaking
			directly ahead.
			They're powering weapons.
			Red alert. Raise shields. Standby
			phasers.
			Sir... they are hailing us.
			On screen.
			I am Commander Sirol of the
			Romulan vessel Terix. To whom do
			I have the honor of speaking?
			I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the Federation starship
			Enterprise.
			Captain Picard... I've heard so
			much about you. It's a pleasure
			to make your acquaintance.
			I hope our sudden appearance
			didn't startle you.
			Not at all. But an... unannounced
			appearance like this could have
			unfortunate consequences. It
			would be a shame if your ship were
			damaged during such a...
			misunderstanding.
			I am touched by your concern for
			my ship. But I doubt we were ever
			in any danger.
			May I ask what you are doing in
			this system?
			I could ask you the same question.
			We are conducting a survey of
			gaseous anomalies.
			How interesting. So are we.
			Perhaps we could combine our
			efforts and share our findings.
			I doubt our objectives are...
			compatible.
			You are probably right.
			This has been a most pleasant
			conversation... but we must
			return to our research.
			Then I won't keep you.
			They are moving off... resuming
			their tachyon scans of the system.
			Stand down from Red Alert, but
			continue to track their movements,
			Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			Commander, how long will it take
			to search the system?
			At least seven days, sir.
			And the Romulans have a two day
			head start.
			Then we better get to it. Mister
			Data?
			Initiating sensor sweep of grid
			zero one.
			How long have you had the beard?
			About four years. I think I just
			got tired of hearing how "young"
			I looked.
			What was it that Lieutenant Boylen
			used to call you?
			Ensign Babyface.
			You never did have much sense of
			humor.
			I like to think I've loosened up
			in my old age.
			Really?
			I've been known to tell a joke or
			two.
			It's about time. You were always
			so serious on the Pegasus.
			We went through some... serious
			times.
			Do you really think we'll find the
			Pegasus?
			I wouldn't have come all the way
			out here if I didn't.
			And what about our... experiment?
			Do you think we'll find that too?
			Maybe.
			You know... I still think about
			what happened... about that last
			day.
			So do I. It's not the kind of
			thing you just forget about.
			Do you ever... wonder whether we
			did the right thing?
			Never. It was a tragedy, yes.
			But it wasn't your fault and it
			wasn't mine. What we were doing
			was for the good of the
			Federation. We can't blame
			ourselves because the others
			couldn't see that.
			I know... but maybe we went about
			it the wrong way.
			Well, this time we may have a
			chance to do it the right way. If
			this mission is successful... if
			we do find the Pegasus and our
			"experiment"... we can finish
			what we started twelve years ago.
			You want to try again?
			It's not just me.
			The Chief of Starfleet Security
			has personally assured me of her
			complete support.
			Admiral Raner... ? How many other
			people know about this?
			Not many. And it's up to us to
			make sure it stays that way.
			Raner gave me written orders for
			you... you'll find them coded in
			the Enterprise computer. You've
			been instructed not to reveal the
			true nature of our mission to
			anyone, not even Captain Picard.
			Don't worry... it won't be like it
			was twelve years ago. This time,
			no one's going to stop us.
			... as a matter of fact, I never
			met Wil before he reported aboard
			at Farpoint Station.
			You chose your first officer
			without ever meeting him?
			I was looking through the records
			of about fifty candidates... Wil's
			was much like all the others...
			filled with the usual dry
			statistics and glowing letters of
			recommendation that tell you
			nothing. I was about to put it
			aside and go on to the next file,
			when something caught my eye.
			There had been an incident on
			Altair Three when Wil was First
			Officer of the Hood. He refused
			to let Captain DeSoto beam down
			during a crisis. He disobeyed a
			direct order and risked a general
			court martial because he thought
			he was right. When I read that...
			I knew I'd found my Number One.
			You wanted someone with a history
			of disobedience?
			I wanted someone who would stand
			up to me... someone who was more
			concerned with the safety of the
			ship and accomplishing the mission
			than with how something looked on
			his record. To me, that's one of
			the marks of a good officer.
			Frankly, I've always felt it was
			more important for an officer to
			trust his captain's judgment. In
			a crisis, there's no time for
			explanations... orders have to be
			obeyed without question or lives
			may be lost.
			I am aware of that, Admiral.
			Of course you are.
			I guess this mission has brought
			up some... old ghosts for me. You
			know what it's like to lose a
			ship... you're always wondering
			if there was something else you
			should have done... something you
			missed.
			Admiral... the records regarding
			the loss of the Pegasus are a
			bit... vague about what happened
			just before you abandoned ship.
			Can you add anything to the...
			official account?
			I'm afraid not.
			But I can tell you this: Twelve
			years ago, I needed an officer I
			could count on in a crisis...
			someone who would support and obey
			my decisions without question...
			someone willing to trust my
			judgment... that someone was Wil
			Riker... and without his loyalty,
			none of us would have survived.
			What's wrong?
			I think I busted a rib.
			What were you doing?
			I was practicing Bat'leth moves
			with Worf. I jabbed when I
			should've blocked. He caught me
			right in the side. I'm glad we
			were using sticks instead of real
			blades.
			It's broken all right.
			Give him ten cc's of terakine for
			the pain.
			I can't believe how stupid I was.
			You both got a little carried
			away, that's all...
			No. It was my fault. I lost
			focus... I let myself get
			distracted at a crucial moment.
			It happens to everyone.
			I knew what I was supposed to
			do... but I didn't do it. If
			we'd had real Bat'leths I might be
			dead right now.
			Wil... it's all right. You made
			a mistake... no harm done. You'll
			do better next time.
			Yeah... maybe.
			Scan of grid one five seven is
			complete. Moving to grid one five
			eight.
			The Romulan ship is still
			searching grid two seven zero.
			They're sure taking their time
			over there. I wonder if they--
			Whoa... I think we might have just
			struck paydirt.
			There's a subspace resonance
			signature coming from this
			asteroid.
			And from the frequency variances,
			it looks like the pattern from a
			Federation warp core.
			Captain Picard to the Bridge,
			please.
			Bring us to within ten kilometers
			of asteroid gamma six zero one.
			Geordi's found something.
			There's a subspace resonance
			signature coming from that
			asteroid, sir. It could be the
			warp core of the Pegasus.
			I think he's right... I recognize
			some of the variance patterns.
			Put the asteroid on the main
			viewer.
			I have confirmed Geordi's
			readings, sir. The resonance
			signature is originating from
			somewhere beneath the asteroid's
			surface.
			Beneath the surface? How's that
			possible?
			This asteroid contains several
			deep chasms large enough for a
			starship to enter. It is possible
			the Pegasus drifted into the
			asteroid's gravitational field and
			was pulled down into one of the
			fissures.
			Sir, the Romulan warbird has
			altered course again... they are
			heading toward our position.
			They probably want to see what
			we're so interested in over here.
			Mister Data, how long will it take
			to determine the exact location of
			the Pegasus?
			At least another six hours,
			Captain.
			That's too long. If the Romulans
			start searching the asteroid, they
			could find the ship before we do.
			I recommend we destroy the
			asteroid. It would take almost
			all our photon torpedoes, but it
			would preclude any possibility of
			the Pegasus falling into Romulan
			hands.
			Our top priority is to salvage the
			ship, Commander. I'll consider
			destroying it only as a last
			resort.
			Yes, sir.
			Can you give me a third
			alternative?
			Mister Data, is it possible to
			saturate the asteroid with
			verteron particles? That could
			mask the resonance signature from
			the Romulans... prevent them from
			detecting it.
			In order for the deception to
			succeed, it would have to appear
			to be a natural phenomenon.
			Verteron particles are artificial
			in nature.
			Wait a minute... we could blanket
			the asteroid with high levels of
			ionizing radiation. There's so
			much of it in this system already,
			the Romulans won't know the
			difference.
			Data?
			Theoretically, it should work..
			If we're going to do it, we have
			to do it fast... the Romulans will
			be in sensor range in about a
			minute.
			Make it so, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir. Initiating an
			ionization field pulse.
			After he's finished, we'll have to
			move off... make it look like we
			scanned the asteroid, but didn't
			find anything.
			Lay in a course to the next search
			grid and stand-by to engage.
			If this works, the Romulans won't
			find anything and we can return
			later. But if it doesn't...
			If it doesn't... we'll have handed
			them the Pegasus.
			Ionization pulse complete.
			Helm, one quarter impulse.
			Engage.
			The Romulans are initiating a
			tachyon scan of the asteroid...
			They have switched to their
			lateral sensor array... beginning
			another scan.
			They're certainly being thorough.
			The Warbird has completed its
			sensor sweep.
			If they found the resonance
			signature, they should be sending
			away teams any second now...
			They are moving off.
			Mister Data, we have to convince
			the Romulans that we're still
			looking for the Pegasus. I want
			you to continue scanning this
			system.
			Yes, sir.
			I want to be back at this asteroid
			at zero eight hundred hours
			tomorrow. Plot our search pattern
			accordingly.
			Aye, sir.
			Admiral, if you'd care to join me
			for a late dinner... ?
			Thank you, no. I think I'm going
			to turn in early.
			Very well.
			Number One, you have the Bridge.
			Oh, and will you bring the scan
			analysis to my quarters when you
			go off watch?
			Aye, sir.
			Initiate search of grid one six
			three.
			Beginning sensor sweeps...
			Commander, I want to see you in
			the Captain's Ready Room.
			Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			What the hell's the matter with
			you? Destroy the Pegasus? Before
			we've even taken a look at it?
			I thought it was more important to
			keep the Romulans from--
			Well, you were wrong. We have a
			chance here to change the balance
			of power in this quadrant. But we
			can't do that if we destroy the
			Pegasus, now can we?
			No, sir.
			It hasn't been easy I'm sure...
			keeping your Captain and friends
			in the dark like this...
			I haven't enjoyed it if that's
			what you mean.
			I hope you understand that it's
			necessary.
			I understand that you think it's
			necessary.
			You have changed.
			Changed... ?
			Just something the Captain and I
			were talking about...
			To be honest... I'm glad to see
			this kind of change in you, Wil.
			Strong... forceful... unafraid to
			state your opinions and stand by
			them... a far cry from the young
			man who used to sit at my helm and
			worry about pressing the wrong
			button.
			A lot of things can change in
			twelve years, Admiral.
			Yes, they can.
			But it's important that a man
			changes the right things in his
			life... not his sense of duty...
			his sense of loyalty...
			I'd like to think that I...
			haven't changed those things, sir.
			I'd like to think so too. Because
			those things say more about a man
			than the rank on his collar or the
			uniform he wears... they define
			him.
			Twelve years ago, a lot of older
			and more seasoned officers turned
			away from their duty, but you
			stood up for what was right. I
			know what kind of man you are,
			Wil... and I know I can count on
			you again.
			Come.
			The scan analysis you asked for.
			Thank you. Can I interest you in
			some sashimi?
			No, thanks.
			Is there anything else, sir?
			Yes, there is.
			"Judge Advocate General's Report.
			Stardate xxxxx. Subject: Inquiry
			into Mutiny Aboard USS Pegasus."
			"Based on testimony from Captain
			Pressman and other surviving
			officers, the Judge Advocate
			believes there is sufficient
			evidence to conclude that certain
			members of the crew did mutiny
			against the captain just prior to
			the destruction of the Pegasus."
			Mutiny... on a Federation
			starship. It's shocking -- no,
			it's unthinkable. And yet you've
			never mentioned it.
			No, sir.
			It wasn't easy getting this
			record. I had to call in a few
			favors at Starfleet just to get a
			look at it. It seems the file was
			sealed by Starfleet Intelligence.
			So... not only was the Pegasus
			carrying "sensitive" equipment
			that can't be allowed to fall into
			Romulan hands...
			... not only was there a mysterious
			explosion which appeared to
			destroy the ship, but didn't...
			but now it turns out there was a
			mutiny on board.
			I've read the official report of
			the mutiny. But I'd like to hear
			your version of what happened.
			I was on the Bridge. The ship was
			at yellow alert... we were running
			some... tests on the engines.
			Something went wrong... there was
			an explosion in Engineering...
			heavy casualties. In the middle
			of the crisis, the First Officer,
			the Chief Engineer, almost the
			entire Bridge crew mutinied
			against Captain Pressman.
			Why?
			They... felt the Captain was
			jeopardizing the ship.
			And you?
			I was seven months out of the
			Academy... my head was still
			ringing with words like duty and
			honor.
			When they moved against him, I
			thought they were a group of self-serving,
			disloyal officers.
			So I grabbed a phaser and defended
			my captain. Two or three others
			joined in on our side, but it was
			clear the mutineers had most of
			the crew behind them... we felt we
			had to get off the ship. There
			was a... running firefight all
			the way to the escape pod.
			About five minutes after we left
			the ship... there was an
			explosion...
			"The Judge Advocate also believes
			that the surviving officers are
			deliberately withholding vital
			information from this inquiry.
			Further investigation is
			recommended."
			But there was no further
			investigation... the file was
			classified and quietly buried.
			Why?
			Sir... maybe you should take this
			up with the Admiral.
			I'm taking it up with you. The
			Judge Advocate thought you were
			participating in a conspiracy to
			cover-up the truth. That you were
			lying about what really happened
			on the Pegasus. Now, I want you
			to tell me that's not true.
			Wil, what the hell's going on
			here? Why did your crew mutiny?
			And why is Pressman so determined
			to find your ship twelve years
			later?
			I've told you all I can. I am
			under the direct orders of Admiral
			Pressman... not to discuss this.
			Sir.
			Very well. He's an admiral, I'm
			a captain -- I can't force you to
			disobey him.
			I will tell you this... I need to
			place a great deal of trust in the
			person who serves as my first
			officer. You've had that trust...
			until now. But something is wrong
			here... and you're part of it.
			And when this mission is over...
			I may have to re-evaluate the
			command structure of this ship.
			Dismissed.
			Captain, Starfleet places the
			highest priority on the success of
			this mission. Your request for a
			delay is denied.
			Margaret... something's very wrong
			here. Do you know what's going
			on?
			I know that the Chief of Starfleet
			Intelligence herself is watching
			this one, Jean-Luc. So you would
			be well-advised to follow
			Pressman's orders and leave it at
			that. Starfleet out.
			Worf to Captain Picard. We are
			approaching asteroid gamma six
			zero one, sir.
			On my way.
			Mister Worf, where are the
			Romulans?
			They are out of sensor range on
			the far side of the system.
			Bring us to within fifteen
			kilometers and hold position.
			For the past several hours, I have
			been scanning the area where we
			detected the resonance signature
			of the Pegasus. From the strength
			and polarity of the signature, it
			would appear that most of the warp
			core is still intact.
			If we're lucky, the entire
			engineering section could be down
			there.
			So how do we get to it? I
			wouldn't want to try to transport
			through that much solid rock.
			Agreed. What about a shuttle? We
			could send it down through one of
			these fissures.
			I would recommend against that,
			sir. There may be gravimetric or
			magnetic fluctuations inside the
			asteroid which would overpower the
			engines on a shuttlecraft.
			Sounds like the best solution is
			to take the Enterprise in.
			You mean into the asteroid?
			That's right.
			Put this fissure on the main
			viewer.
			This chasm is large enough for us
			to maneuver in. Besides, if
			there's any hope of salvaging the
			Pegasus, we'll need a starship to
			do it.
			Mister Data?
			It is theoretically possible,
			Captain. But I am unaware of any
			prior situation where a starship
			was taken so deeply inside a
			planetary body. There may be
			unforeseen difficulties.
			Admiral... I don't think we can
			risk--
			I've made my decision. Prepare to
			take the Enterprise in, Captain.
			That's an order.
			Mister Data, please note in the
			ship's log that this action is
			being taken over my explicit
			objections.
			It is so noted.
			Yellow Alert.
			Shields up, inertial dampers to
			maximum.
			Mister Data, plot a course into
			the chasm... maneuvering thrusters
			only.
			Course plotted.
			Take us in.
			We are now two kilometers beneath
			the surface.
			We are encountering shifts in
			magnetic field density.
			Admiral, if the passage narrows to
			less than five hundred meters, I'm
			going to abort the mission.
			You can charge me with
			insubordination if you wish, but
			I won't risk the Enterprise for a
			salvage operation.
			Sir... I am reading a large
			resonance signature directly
			ahead.
			On screen.
			Pegasus...
			What the hell happened?
			Sensors show that the ship is
			still intact... but approximately
			sixty-five percent of it is
			contained within the asteroid.
			As if half the ship had
			materialized inside solid rock.
			Yes, sir. I do not know how this
			could have happened.
			Let's keep the speculation to a
			minimum. We have to begin the
			salvage operation. The equipment
			we need was in main engineering.
			Can you scan that section of the
			Pegasus?
			The starboard bulkhead of Main
			Engineering is contained within
			the rock face... but most of the
			compartment is still intact.
			There is a hull breach in that
			section.
			If we begin a power transfer, can
			you restore life support to that
			compartment?
			I believe so. The breach can be
			temporarily sealed by extending
			our shields.
			See to it. Once you've restored
			life support, Commander Riker and
			I will beam directly into
			Engineering.
			Admiral, I'd like to send a
			complete Away Team to --
			There's some very sensitive
			equipment over there. I don't
			want anyone else near it.
			Yes, sir.
			This room was open to space for
			twelve years...
			The vacuum preserved everything...
			I wonder how many of the crew are
			back there...
			We're not here for a memorial
			service.
			It should be in here.
			It's still intact.
			What's wrong? Don't you
			understand? We found it.
			I know. I just kept hoping it
			wasn't going to be here... that it
			would've been destroyed or buried
			back there in the rock...
			What the hell's that supposed to
			mean?
			It means I can't put this off any
			longer. Right up until this
			moment, I had the... luxury of
			time. Now I have to make a
			choice.
			And Admiral... I'm afraid the only
			choice I can make... is to put a
			stop to this. I can't let you
			start these experiments all over
			again. It was wrong twelve years
			ago, and it's still wrong today.
			You'd better reconsider that
			position, Commander. We have a
			mission to accomplish and you're
			going to carry it out.
			That's all that matters to you,
			isn't it -- starting your
			experiment again. Look around...
			we're standing in a room filled
			with bodies... people who died
			because of that thing.
			Keep your self-righteous comments
			to yourself. I knew most of these
			people a lot longer than you
			did... it was tragic. But it was
			their own fault.
			You don't know that. Neither of
			us knows what happened after we
			left.
			It's not hard to guess. They
			tried to shut down an experiment
			they didn't understand. Something
			went wrong. And it killed them.
			No... we killed them.
			That doesn't sound like the young
			Conn Officer who grabbed a phaser
			and defended his captain twelve
			years ago.
			Yeah, well I've had twelve years
			to think about it. And if I had
			to do it over again... I'd point
			that phaser at you instead of
			them.
			So on reflection... you'd rather
			be a traitor than a hero.
			I wasn't a hero and neither were
			you. What you were doing was
			wrong and I was wrong to support
			you... I was just too young and
			stupid to realize it at the time.
			You were the captain, I was the
			ensign... and I followed orders.
			And if you hadn't, you'd be dead
			right now along with all the rest.
			Dead because you listened to a
			bunch of mutinous cowards who were
			too blinded by fear to see what I
			was trying to do.
			They were brave enough to risk
			their lives to stop you from
			violating a treaty the Federation
			signed in good faith.
			That treaty has bound our hands
			and given the Romulans a tactical
			advantage for sixty years. I was
			simply trying to level the playing
			field.
			And now you're going to try again.
			How many people will die this
			time? Fifty? A hundred? A
			thousand?
			You don't want to help me... fine.
			But you're still under my direct
			orders not to talk about what you
			know... and I expect you to follow
			those orders to the letter.
			I made you... and I can break you
			just as easily.
			Picard to Away Team. Prepare to
			return to the ship immediately.
			Stand-by, Enterprise.
			Pressman to Enterprise. Two
			people, one piece of equipment to
			beam up.
			Report.
			The Romulans fired on the entrance
			to the chasm with their
			disruptors... they've sealed us
			in.
			Sir... there is an incoming
			message... it is from the
			Warbird.
			On screen.
			Captain... you seem to be in a
			very... unfortunate circumstance.
			How can we help?
			Are you responsible for this?
			I'm not sure. We were conducting
			some... geological experiments on
			the surface of the asteroid. It's
			possible that we... accidently
			sealed you in.
			If only we had known you were
			beneath the surface... if you had
			shared your plans with us, this
			might have been avoided.
			What is it you want, Sirol?
			I don't want anything, Captain.
			But I will offer to help you.
			How?
			By transporting your crew aboard
			my ship. We'll take you back to
			Romulus... where after a short
			stay as our guests, you will be
			returned to the Federation.
			Thank you for your... generous
			offer. I will... take it under
			advisement.
			As you wish. We'll be continuing
			our... research in this system for
			a while longer. I await your
			decision.
			We can't do it. If we abandon the
			Enterprise they'll come back here
			and get their hands on both ships.
			Agreed. Options?
			We could use the phasers to cut
			our way out.
			The asteroid's internal structure
			is highly unstable. Any attempt
			to cut through the rock could
			cause the entire chasm to
			collapse.
			Captain... I have a suggestion.
			There's a piece of equipment under
			guard in Admiral Pressman's
			quarters which could get us out of
			here.
			It's a prototype for a Federation
			cloaking device.
			You just ended your career, Wil.
			That's what this is all about? A
			cloaking device? In the Treaty of
			Algeron the Federation
			specifically agreed not to develop
			cloaking technology.
			And that treaty is the biggest
			mistake we ever made. It's kept
			us from exploiting a vital area of
			defense that--
			That treaty has kept the peace for
			sixty years. And as a Starfleet
			officer, you are sworn to uphold
			it.
			That's enough. I'm taking command
			of this vessel. Mister Worf,
			escort the Captain to his
			quarters.
			I don't think anyone's going to
			come to your defense this time.
			How can we use the cloak to escape
			the asteroid?
			It's more than just a cloak. It
			changes the structure of matter...
			in theory, a ship using this
			device would be able to pass
			through normal matter.
			That's why you were so eager to
			find it...
			Can't you see the potential here?
			The phasing cloak could be the
			greatest breakthrough in weapons
			research in the last fifty years.
			Except it's illegal... it's a
			violation of an agreement the
			Federation signed in good faith.
			Captain... we might be able to
			adapt the cloak for the Enterprise
			engines and use it to escape the
			asteroid.
			Mister Data?
			It is theoretically possible, sir.
			But it will take several hours to
			study the device and determine how
			to link it to our systems.
			Make it so.
			Captain's Log: Stardate 47457.1.
			We have been trapped inside the
			asteroid for over eight hours.
			Mister Data and Commander La Forge
			inform me that they are nearly
			ready to engage the cloak.
			Commander, I've routed the impulse
			engines through the warp plasma
			conduits... but you'll have to
			watch the intercooler levels... if
			they go too high, we'll blow out
			the entire relay system.
			Understood.
			I think that's what happened
			twelve years ago. The cloak blew
			out the plasma relays on the
			Pegasus after we left the ship...
			the plasma ignited in space, and
			it looked like the ship had been
			destroyed.
			So the ship drifted into this
			system... still in a phased
			state... and when it passed
			through this asteroid...
			The cloak failed. And half the
			ship materialized in solid rock.
			La Forge to Bridge. The cloak is
			on-line and ready to begin phase
			sequencing.
			Proceed, Number One.
			Aye, sir.
			Activating power systems...
			Report.
			The cloak appears to be
			functioning normally. The ship's
			matter/energy phasing rate should
			be sufficient to pass through the
			asteroid.
			Take us out. Maneuvering
			thrusters only.
			We will reach the rock face in...
			five seconds.
			We have passed through two
			kilometers of the asteroid... now
			within one kilometer of the
			surface.
			We're approaching the surface...
			We have cleared the asteroid,
			Captain.
			The Warbird is off the port bow.
			They're still waiting for us to
			make up our minds.
			Disengage the cloaking device,
			Commander.
			What? You can't do that. If the
			Romulans see us decloak, they'll
			know that we have --
			They'll know the truth, Admiral.
			Which is what everyone is going to
			know very shortly.
			Carry out my orders.
			Mister Worf, send a message to the
			Warbird... inform them that their
			government will be contacted
			shortly regarding this incident.
			Aye, sir.
			Admiral, I hereby charge you with
			violation of the Treaty of
			Algeron. As Captain of the
			Enterprise, I'm placing you under
			arrest. Mister Worf?
			Admiral, if you will come with
			me...
			I have a lot of friends at
			Starfleet Command, Captain.
			You're going to need them.
			Lieutenant. I'll have to be
			placed under arrest as well.
			I've spoken to Fleet Admiral
			Shanthi. There will be a full
			inquiry once we reach Starbase two-four-seven...
			and it will probably
			lead to a general court martial of
			Admiral Pressman and several
			others at Starfleet Intelligence.
			Your... involvement in this affair
			will be thoroughly investigated,
			Wil... there will be some hard
			questions for you to answer...
			I understand.
			You made a mistake twelve years
			ago... but your service since that
			time has earned you a great deal
			of respect... from me and from a
			great many others. This incident
			may cost you some of that
			respect...
			I can't help feeling that I should
			have come forward a long time
			ago...
			When the moment came to make the
			decision... you made the right
			one...
			No matter what that choice may
			have cost you... and no matter how
			much Pressman may have meant to
			you... you chose to tell the
			truth and face the consequences.
			As long as you can do that...
			you'll still deserve to wear that
			uniform... and I'll still be
			proud to have you as my first
			officer.
