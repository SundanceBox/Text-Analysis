			"I have bedimm'd the noontide sun,
			call'd forth the mutinous winds,
			and 'twixt the green sea and the
			azur'd vault set roaring war: to
			the dread rattling thunder have I
			given fire, and rifted Jove's
			stout oak with his own bolt; the
			strong-bas'd promontory have I
			made shake and by the spurs
			pluck'd up the pine and cedar;
			graves at my command have wak'd
			their sleepers, op'd, and let 'em
			forth by my so potent art."
			"But this rough magic I here
			abjure; and, when I have requir'd
			some Heavenly music -- which even
			now I do -- to work mine end upon
			their senses, that this airy charm
			is for, I'll break my staff, bury
			it certain fadoms in the earth,
			and deeper than did ever plummet
			sound -- I'll drown my book."
			Captain, your attention is...
			wandering.
			I can barely see.
			Sir, I am supposed to be
			attempting a Neo-Platonic magical
			rite -- the darkness is
			appropriate to such a ritual.
			This is a play, Data. The
			audience has to see you.
			Perhaps I have been too... literal
			with respect to my set design.
			Computer. Modify Holodeck program
			Data seven-three, Shakespeare's
			The Tempest, Act Five, scene one.
			Increase torchlight by twenty-percent.
			Much better.
			Would you like to try it again?
			Yes, sir... but I am not certain
			I fully understand the character
			of Prospero. I would appreciate
			any insights you may have which
			would improve my performance.
			Well... Shakespeare witnessed the
			end of the Renaissance and the
			birth of the modern era. Prospero
			found himself in a world which no
			longer had any use for his
			powers...
			Here he is about to perform one
			final creative act before giving
			up his art forever.
			There is certainly a tragic aspect
			to the character.
			Yes, but he had a certain...
			expectancy as well. A hopefulness
			about the future...
			Shakespeare enjoyed mixing
			opposites...
			Past and future... Despair and
			hope...
			Data, is this part of your
			program?
			No, Sir.
			Then what is it?
			It appears to be a steam
			locomotive.
			A train?
			If I am not mistaken.
			Computer, end program.
			Computer, end program...
			Captain, you are injured...
			It's just a scrape... I'll have it
			seen to...
			The train we encountered is from
			one of Doctor Crusher's Holodeck
			programs. It is a re-creation of
			the Orient Express, a train which
			ran from Paris to Istanbul from
			the late nineteenth century until --
			Yes, yes, I know about the Orient
			Express... but what was it doing
			on Prospero's Island?
			There appears to have been a
			malfunction in the Holodeck's
			database retrieval system. The
			two programs were somehow
			temporarily linked together.
			Could this malfunction affect the
			other Holodecks as well?
			It is a possibility. I would have
			to run a diagnostic to be certain.
			All right, get to it. And shut
			down all of the Holodecks until
			you're finished, just to be on the
			safe side.
			Aye, sir.
			I never realized you were
			interested in trains. Did you
			know that at its peak, the Orient
			Express carried over ten thousand
			passengers a year?
			It's not really the train itself
			I'm interested in...
			Then what?
			The experience.
			The Orient Express was... mystery
			and romance. It was an elegant
			way to see exotic places and meet
			fascinating people...
			Did you know that on one trip,
			both Sigmund Freud and Gertrude
			Stein just happened to be on the
			same car? They ended up having
			dinner together every night.
			I wonder what they talked
			about... ?
			Why don't you take a trip
			yourself... and find out?
			Riker to Picard.
			Picard here.
			All sections are ready to begin
			the survey, sir.
			Very good. I'm on my way.
			Think about that trip, Jean-Luc...
			You never know who you'll meet on
			the Orient Express...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47869.2.
			After weathering an unexpected
			magnascopic storm in the Mekorda
			Sector, we are continuing our
			search for new Federation colony
			sites.
			I don't see any possibility of
			developing sites in this region.
			Most of the stars are mainsequence
			binaries with no M-class
			planets.
			All right then, let's move on to
			the next survey region... Have
			stellar cartography begin a--
			Mister Data, report.
			The ship has gone into warp, sir.
			Who gave the command?
			Apparently no one. Helm and
			navigation controls are not
			functioning.
			Our speed is now warp seven-point-three
			and holding.
			Picard to Engineering. Mister La
			Forge, what's going on down there?
			I don't understand it, sir. The
			impulse systems suddenly cut out
			and the warp drive kicked in.
			Geordi, can you take the engines
			off-line?
			I'm working on it...
			Data, what's our heading?
			Bearing one-eight-seven mark four.
			I am unable to determine our
			destination -- but we are heading
			away from the Mekorda sector.
			Captain, the computer's locked-out
			all the propulsion controls... I
			can't access any of the
			overrides...
			If you want us to stop, we'll have
			to do an emergency core shutdown...
			That'll leave us without warp
			power for more than a week...
			Begin the procedure, Mister La
			Forge...
			We are no longer at warp...
			Impulse power has resumed... all
			systems show normal.
			Where are we?
			We are approximately thirty-billion
			kilometers from our
			original position.
			Good work, Geordi.
			It wasn't me that took us out of
			warp, sir. I didn't have time to
			complete the shut-down
			procedure...
			Well, I want an explanation.
			Picard out.
			Have you found anything, yet?
			Only that we've got more than one
			mystery here, sir...
			We still don't know why the ship
			jumped into warp... but it looks
			like we're lucky it did.
			There was a theta flux distortion
			building up around the ship.
			Why didn't the sensors alert us?
			Our sensors were never designed to
			detect theta flux distortions.
			And yet -- there is a record of
			the distortion in the sensor log.
			That's the other mystery.
			One fact is clear, however. The
			distortion was gaining in
			strength. If we had remained at
			our original position one-point
			seven seconds longer, the
			distortion would have ruptured our
			warp core.
			If the Enterprise hadn't jumped
			into warp when it did... we
			would've been blown to pieces.
			I just don't get it, Data. What
			could have caused the engines to
			jump into warp drive on their own?
			Perhaps the engines were activated
			by a random power fluctuation.
			Which occurred just in time to
			save the ship?
			It is improbable... but it is
			possible.
			Well, I don't think I'm ready to
			start believing in luck.
			There is another possibility. The
			sensors apparently detected a
			dangerous anomaly that threatened
			the Enterprise. It is possible
			that they triggered a safety
			response which caused the ship to
			avoid destruction.
			But there's no direct link between
			the sensors and the warp
			engines...
			What is this... ?
			It's some kind of new circuit
			node... and it's connected to at
			least half a dozen points in the
			sensor array...
			It appears to be connected to
			several other systems as well...
			including the warp control
			circuits.
			I guess there is a link between
			the sensors and the engines after
			all..
			A force field... where did that
			come from?
			I am not certain -- possibly from
			the node itself.
			Well... wherever it came from...
			it sure doesn't want us messing
			with that node.
			It appears to be protecting
			itself.
			We found these "nodes" in several
			systems around the ship. At some
			level, they were all connected to
			each other.
			There were nodes linking the
			sensors to our warp control and
			defensive systems. We believe
			this is why the ship jumped to
			warp.
			When the sensors detected danger,
			the defensive systems reacted to
			the threat -- and activated the
			warp engines to protect us.
			Where did these nodes come from?
			It is possible that the
			magnascopic storm we recently
			experienced had an unexpected
			effect on the ship's systems.
			Wherever they came from, they seem
			to be multiplying.
			As they increase, it will become
			progressively more difficult to
			control the ship.
			What do you propose we do?
			Well, it's not going to be easy to
			get rid of them.
			When we attempted to examine the
			circuitry of one of the nodes, it
			generated a force-field to keep us
			out.
			Whatever's going on here -- our
			first priority is to get back
			control of the ship.
			Agreed...
			All of the nodes intersect in
			Holodeck three. It appears to be
			a... focal point of some kind.
			We might be able to find a way to
			use the Holodeck circuits to
			disable the nodes...
			All right. Let's do it.
			Commander, the Holodeck appears to
			be in operation.
			I thought you shut down the entire
			system.
			I did. However, it has reactivated
			itself... and it will
			not disengage.
			Which program is running?
			Several different programs appear
			to be running simultaneously.
			Well... this should be
			interesting...
			You weren't kidding, Data...
			No, sir. I estimate that this...
			scene consists of portions of at
			least seven distinct Holodeck
			programs...
			See if you can access the circuits
			that have been affected by the
			nodes.
			Tickets please... please have your
			tickets ready...
			You know, I've never even been
			away from home... and now I'm
			goin' all the way to Vertiform
			City!
			Very nice, sir. Enjoy your trip.
			Tickets please... please have your
			tickets ready...
			Commander...
			We have located a large
			concentration of nodes behind this
			wall... They appear to be
			connected directly to the
			Holodeck's main power coupling.
			All right... go ahead and
			depolarize the entire power grid.
			Get away from there...
			Would you gentlemen care to show
			me your tickets?
			We... left them in our
			compartments.
			I told you to bring the tickets.
			I... forgot.
			I don't think you folks belong on
			this train...
			You leave these people alone!
			They're only trying to help!
			Get back to the engine. This
			doesn't concern you.
			They're trying to hijack the
			train...
			Hey, if you're the Engineer, then
			who's doing the drivin'?
			I am.
			I'm all right...
			It looks like the navigational
			relays overloaded...
			I believe we have changed
			direction...
			Now we're on the right track!
			Ladies and Gentlemen... we are on
			our way!
			Picard to La Forge. What's going
			on? We just went into warp...
			We've lost engine and helm control
			again, sir... but this time,
			they're completely burned out.
			I don't know if we can stop the
			ship.
			I was right -- he was tryin' to
			make off with my brick.
			You take good care of that -- we
			can't afford to lose it.
			Are you people going to leave...
			or are we going to have to throw
			you off this train?
			According to my tricorder, the
			Holodeck safeties have been
			disengaged. His weapon could be
			lethal.
			All right... let's get out of
			here.
			The number of systems now affected
			by the nodes has grown
			considerably.
			Sensors, engines, replicators,
			propulsion... they are all working
			together now, almost independently
			of the main computer. And the
			nodes link all of them through the
			Holodeck.
			But why the Holodeck? That
			doesn't make any sense.
			Commander, I think what happens on
			the Holodeck has a direct effect
			on the ship. When we attempted to
			destroy the nodes -- the
			characters on the train responded
			immediately to stop us.
			And when the Engineer tried to
			protect us -- one of the
			characters shot him.
			The Conductor then signalled for
			the train to change directions...
			and at approximately the same time --
			-- the Enterprise took off in a
			new direction, too.
			Are you saying... that the ship is
			being controlled by the Holodeck?
			Not precisely.
			Geordi, does the configuration of
			the connection nodes look familiar
			to you?
			Yeah... it's... a little like the
			structure of your positronic
			brain.
			That is correct. It appears that
			the nodes are in the process of
			creating a rudimentary neural net.
			Data -- what are you suggesting?
			Unlikely as it may sound... I
			believe that the Enterprise may be
			forming an intelligence.
			This is a synaptic map of the
			human neo-cortex...
			This is a cross-section of my
			positronic net...
			And this is a schematic of the
			connection nodes linking the
			ship's systems...
			I believe some sort of neural
			matrix is forming on the ship. It
			is still relatively primitive, but
			it is an intelligence nonetheless.
			How could this happen?
			I believe it is an emergent
			property.
			Explain.
			Complex systems can sometimes
			behave in ways that are entirely
			unpredictable. The human brain,
			for example, might be described in
			terms of cellular functions and
			neuro-chemical interactions.
			But that description does not
			explain human consciousness -- a
			capacity that far exceeds simple
			neural functions.
			Consciousness is an emergent
			property.
			In other words, something that's
			more than the sum of its parts...
			Exactly.
			How does that explain what's
			happening to the Enterprise?
			The Enterprise contains a vast
			database of information which is
			managed by a sophisticated
			computer. This complex system
			gives the ship many of the
			characteristics of a biological
			organism.
			That's true... it "sees" with its
			sensors... "talks" with its
			communications systems...
			In a sense, it even "reproduces"
			with the replicators...
			And you think the ship has somehow
			gone beyond those functions... has
			developed a new capacity...
			Yes, sir. I believe a self-determining
			intelligence is
			emerging.
			If that is so... what does the
			ship want? Where is it taking us?
			I believe the key to understanding
			the ship's behavior lies in the
			Holodeck.
			All of the connection nodes
			intersect at that location. It is
			clearly some kind of processing
			center.
			Processing center... ?
			Yes, sir. A focal point... where
			all the ideas and instincts of
			this emerging intelligence are
			first expressed in some form.
			Almost like an "imagination... "
			Sir, I'd like to go to the
			Holodeck. I could interact with
			the characters... maybe find some
			clues that would help us
			understand what's happening.
			Very well. Mister Data, Mister
			Worf, you'll go along. See if
			there's any way to re-establish
			control of the ship without
			destroying the nodes.
			If this ship truly is an emerging
			intelligence, then it's our
			responsibility to treat it with
			the same respect we would give any
			other being.
			Welcome aboard, Counselor...
			If you will distract these people,
			I will attempt to depolarize the
			power grid.
			Have you finished the puzzle yet?
			Not yet... but we're gettin'
			close.
			Do you recognize it?
			No...
			I'd like to help.
			Tell me... exactly what are you
			making?
			What do you think we're makin'? A
			puzzle!
			No, I mean the picture. What is
			it?
			I don't know.
			Can you deal me in?
			Sorry. It's a two-man game.
			Hey, hey, hey -- keep your hands
			off that.
			Is that why you killed the
			Engineer -- to get this brick?
			I had to get it back. You know
			how much it's worth, lady?
			Plenty.
			And I gotta get it to Keystone
			City.
			Why? What's at Keystone City?
			That's where everything begins...
			Gin.
			Are you succeeding, Commander?
			I am ready to access the main
			power grid.
			Keystone City, next stop.
			Well, look who's back.
			We do not want any trouble, sir.
			We are simply... passengers.
			Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind
			showing me your tickets?
			Right. Sorry, boys... You're
			getting off right here...
			This is my stop.
			Wait -- tell me what happens at
			Keystone City. Why are you taking
			the brick there... ?
			I think we should follow that man.
			That brick may be an important
			clue...
			Where did he go... ?
			I can access the power grid here.
			I will attempt to depolarize the
			grid by using a low-frequency
			inversion field. That may
			disengage the nodes without
			destroying them.
			There he is. I'm going after him.
			I am coming with you.
			What are you doing here?
			Laying the foundation...
			Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
			a train to catch.
			I don't understand it, sir...
			Cargo Bay Five suddenly started to
			depressurize...
			Did everyone get out in time?
			Yes, sir, and I've re-established
			the containment field... But I'm
			reading massive power surges in
			the Cargo Bay, and all sorts of
			transporter activity...
			There's something weird happening,
			sir.
			Get a team down there immediately.
			I want to know what's going on.
			Aye, sir.
			La Forge to Bridge...
			Picard here... what's going on?
			I wish I could tell you...
			That man said he was "laying a
			foundation"...
			But a foundation for what... ?
			Troi to Data...
			Data here.
			How are you coming?
			I encountered a minor difficulty,
			Counselor...
			But it has been dealt with. I am
			ready to depolarize the power
			grid.
			It looks like the ship's
			replicator and transporter systems
			have been merged somehow...
			they're working together to create
			this... the question is, what is
			it?
			Ensign, I want to run a full
			spectral analysis on --
			I'm picking up a massive power
			fluctuation... the ship's losing
			structural integrity...
			What's happening?
			An earthquake... ?
			Deanna!
			La Forge to Data -- stop what
			you're doing!
			Acknowledged...
			Data... I think we should get
			together and compare notes.
			The ship was protecting itself
			again -- stopping us from
			interfering. Whatever it's doing --
			it intends to continue.
			I'm betting it all has something
			to do with the object that's
			forming in the Cargo Bay.
			I think he's right, Captain. Look
			at the common themes that are
			playing out on the Holodeck. A
			puzzle being put together... a
			foundation being laid... a paper
			doll being fashioned. All images
			of something being constructed.
			And an object in the Cargo Bay
			that's being constructed -- atom
			by atom.
			What is this object?
			I have no idea. It's composed of
			silica polymers, duranium, and a
			few other compounds we can't
			identify.
			But creating it has put quite a
			strain on our systems. Warp power
			has dropped forty-seven percent...
			Counselor, were you able to draw
			any other conclusions from your
			experience on the Holodeck?
			Anything that might help us handle
			this situation?
			I think the Holodeck is what might
			be called the ship's
			"imagination." It's full of
			fanciful, metaphoric imagery -- as
			though it's having some kind of...
			daydream. It may not make literal
			sense... but symbolically there's
			probably some kind of logic to it.
			The characters you spoke to... do
			they have any particular
			significance?
			I think they represent various
			aspects of the ship. The
			Engineer, for instance... may have
			represented the navigational
			system. The Gunslinger could be
			the weapon system...
			Is there any possibility that we
			might be able to persuade them to
			give back control of the ship?
			I'm not sure it's possible to
			reason with them. Many of them
			seem genuinely unaware of what's
			going on... and of their role in
			it.
			It's as though this emergent
			intelligence is still an infant...
			acting on instinct, trying to
			figure itself out as it goes. The
			only source of experience it can
			draw on is ours -- through our
			Holodeck programs.
			Is there a way to... relate to
			them on their own level...
			influence their behavior in some
			way... ?
			Maybe there is.
			I'd like to go back and try.
			Deanna, the injuries you got on
			the Holodeck could have killed
			you...
			And so far, we haven't been able
			to re-establish the safeties.
			I'm aware of that.
			Go ahead, Counselor. But keep
			this in mind... so far, we've
			tried to thwart the ship in all
			its efforts. And that's gotten us
			nowhere.
			Maybe it's time to try
			cooperating.
			You don't belong on this train!
			Three for Vertiform City.
			Guess I was wrong about you folks.
			Welcome aboard.
			What was that?
			We've been having some problems...
			the engine's running out of
			steam... I hope we make it to
			Vertiform City on time.
			Is there anything we could do to
			help?
			Well, I could use a pair of strong
			arms up in the Engine Room...
			maybe we could get back on
			schedule.
			Why don't you go with him, Worf...
			We'll do what we can here.
			'Scuse me... are we goin' to get
			there okay?
			Of course we are. Don't worry
			about a thing.
			Now... I want you to tell me
			everything you know about
			Vertiform City.
			Well... they got a restaurant
			there... where you can eat all
			you want, any time... it's the
			best food around...
			Well, there's the coal and there's
			the boiler.
			Sure obliged for your help.
			Well done, sir. I think this will
			make a difference, all right...
			I don't know how or why, sir...
			but power's almost back to normal
			levels... life support systems
			coming on line on all decks.
			What's our heading?
			It looks like we're on course
			for... Tambor Beta-six. It's a
			white dwarf star...
			That's the way... keep it
			steady... put your back into it!
			The ship is using a modified
			tractor beam to collect vertion
			particles from the star.
			Vertion particles... "Vertiform"
			City. This is what the ship was
			looking for...
			Sir, the particles are being
			routed through the transporter
			system -- and into Cargo Bay Five.
			Geordi... what's going on?
			The object's absorbing vertion
			particles, sir... and it's growing
			even faster than before.
			Sir... I'm picking up internal
			energy emissions from this
			thing...
			What do you mean?
			It's beginning to generate its own
			energy...
			Can you be more specific?
			I'm picking up coherent
			emissions... matter conversion...
			it's incredible...
			Wait, something's wrong... we've
			got power fluctuations... the
			vertion absorption rate is
			dropping...
			What's happening to the particle
			beam?
			The beam's exhausted the supply of
			particles in the star... there's
			nothing left to take out.
			Captain -- the object's energy
			output is decreasing...
			Something's wrong...
			What is it... ?
			This was supposed to be
			"Vertiform" City...
			We've been on the wrong track all
			along!
			Are you all right?
			Yes... what happened?
			The Conductor accidently derailed
			the train.
			Data to Captain Picard...
			Picard here.
			We have had an accident in the
			Holodeck. Has anything happened
			to the Enterprise?
			Yes -- a ship-wide shutdown.
			We've lost attitude control and
			most systems are off-line.
			Captain, I think you better take
			a look at this...
			When the particle beam cut off,
			the object was beginning to form
			a coherent energy matrix...
			... and if these readings are
			accurate, I'd say the emission
			patterns were almost... organic.
			Are you suggesting that the
			Enterprise has been attempting to
			create... a lifeform?
			I think so...
			Will it... survive?
			Its energy levels are dropping
			rapidly... Unless it gets an
			infusion of vertion particles
			pretty soon... I don't think so.
			Captain, our systems are back on
			line... we're moving again -- at
			warp nine.
			Let's get back to the Bridge.
			Whew... that was a close one,
			wasn't it?
			Where are we going now?
			"New Vertiform City," of course.
			Data to Captain...
			Picard here.
			The train has returned to normal,
			sir...
			... and our destination is "New
			Vertiform City."
			What's our course?
			We're heading for the Cordannas
			system.
			Another white dwarf star?
			Yes. It's the closest one to our
			last position...
			Captain, we've got a problem...
			Even at warp nine, the Cordannas
			system is over twelve hours from
			here...
			Will the object in the cargo bay
			survive that long?
			I think it will, sir, but that's
			not the problem...
			The ship's diverted all of our
			systems to maximize propulsion --
			including life support.
			We've got less than two hours of
			reserve oxygen.
			Mister Data, we have to stop the
			Enterprise. That means you have
			to get control of that train.
			Understood, sir.
			The ship is looking for vertion
			particles... and it believes that
			the Cordannas system is the
			closest source...
			Is there another source --
			something closer?
			White dwarf stars are the only
			natural source, sir.
			Then what about artificial
			sources? Is there any way to
			create them?
			How did the Conductor stop the
			train?
			There is a braking lever in the
			engine room.
			Let's go...
			Sorry, folks. But you ain't goin'
			nowhere.
			I've narrowed the search to the
			MacPherson Nebula, which is a
			supernova remnant... or Dikonalpha,
			a class-nine pulsar...
			They're both fairly close to our
			current flight path... and either
			one might produce vertion
			particles if we detonated a
			modified photon torpedo inside it.
			Vertions usually occur in
			miniscule amounts. Do you think
			either of these phenomena can
			produce enough of them?
			That's hard to say. I can't even
			guarantee that we can create them
			at all.
			Well, we have to give it a try.
			The nebula or the pulsar? It's
			your choice, Mister La Forge.
			I think we should go for the
			nebula.
			Very well. Begin the torpedo
			modifications.
			Now let's hope we can get the ship
			to go where we want it to.
			Please listen to me. We
			understand what's happening. We
			know you must get to New Vertiform
			City.
			And we want to help you get there.
			I dunno...
			Please. We're your friends.
			Well... you're really gonna help
			get us to New Vertiform City?
			Yes. I promise.
			Okay. But just one of you. The
			rest stay here.
			All right, that's far enough.
			Sorry to spoil your party, pal...
			it's nothing personal.
			I can get us there more quickly.
			I know a shorter route.
			Don't listen to him -- he's up to
			somethin'.
			A shorter route... ?
			Yes. If you will let me handle
			the controls.
			Don't do it!
			We're behind schedule now... if he
			could get us there on time...
			Go on. But no funny stuff.
			Data to Captain Picard...
			I have taken control of the engine
			room.
			Stand by.
			Are we within sensor range of the
			nebula?
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Data, try to slow us to
			impulse speed.
			I will attempt to do so.
			I sure hope you know what you're
			doing...
			Are the torpedo modifications
			complete?
			Aye, sir.
			Launch torpedo.
			It's working, sir... the
			reaction's producing vertion
			particles...
			Well, what do you know... we're
			here...
			New Vertiform City...
			The nodes are deactivating all
			over the ship. Our systems are
			beginning to function normally
			again.
			Then the purpose of the ship's
			intelligence... was simply to
			bring that life form into being...
			There are entire species whose
			sole purpose in life is to
			reproduce. And when they finally
			procreate... they die.
			Captain, look...
			Cheers.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. The
			Enterprise is back under our
			control. All traces of the
			emergent intelligence are gone...
			and the object it created has
			disappeared into space...
			Come.
			Captain, I am staging a scene from
			The Tempest this evening for a
			small audience. I would like you
			to attend.
			I'd be honored. Which scene?
			Miranda's first encounter with
			other human beings.
			"Oh brave new world that has such
			people in it."
			It seemed appropriate.
			Captain. You took a significant
			risk in allowing the Enterprise to
			complete its... task.
			Why do you say that?
			Because the end product was
			unknown. The object could have
			been dangerous. It may in fact,
			be dangerous...
			And I've allowed it to go off on
			its merry way.
			Yes, sir.
			The intelligence that formed on
			the Enterprise... it didn't just
			come out of the ship's systems --
			it came out of us. Our mission
			records, our personal logs, even
			our Holodeck programs -- our
			fantasies.
			If our experiences with the
			Enterprise have been honorable...
			Then can't we trust the sum of
			those experiences to be the same?
