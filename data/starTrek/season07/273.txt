			-- as time passes, a boy
			inevitably becomes a man. What is
			not inevitable, is that a man
			become a warrior. A warrior must
			be forged like a sword, tempered
			by...
			-- by experience. The path of the
			warrior begins --
			Alexander --
			Come in.
			No, wait --
			Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.
			What is the meaning of this?
			I'm sorry. We made Fullerenes in
			chemistry class and filled them
			with water --
			I asked you to meet me here after
			school. I have been waiting for
			you.
			I forgot.
			You forgot because you allowed
			yourself to be distracted by
			foolishness.
			I'm sorry.
			There is something important I
			want to discuss with you.
			As time passes, a boy inevitably
			becomes a man. What is not
			inevitable, is that a man become
			a sword --
			What?
			I meant warrior...
			The path of the warrior begins
			with the First Rite of Ascension.
			Is that where they hit you with
			pain sticks?
			No, that is the Second Rite.
			Oh...
			You are approaching the age of
			ascension... it is time for you to
			prepare for the ceremony.
			What do I have to do?
			Your fighting skills will be
			tested... and your knowledge of
			the teachings of Kahless. It is
			very challenging, but I will help
			you prepare.
			This is a kor'tova candle... it
			represents the fire that burns in
			a warrior's heart.
			When you light yours, you will be
			declaring your intention to become
			a warrior.
			Go ahead.
			What if... I don't want to?
			If you do not participate in the
			rite before you are thirteen years
			of age, you will never be able to
			become a true Klingon warrior.
			I don't care about that...
			You may not care now, but someday
			you might.
			Mother always said that I didn't
			have to do any of this Klingon
			stuff if I didn't want to.
			It is your decision... but --
			Good, then I'm not going to do it.
			Alexander --
			You just said it was up to me.
			And I don't want to be a warrior.
			As a result, the Kearsarge won't
			be able to rendezvous with us for
			another four days.
			Will we be holding position here
			until it arrives?
			Yes. And, as it looks as though
			we'll have a few days of relative
			quiet, I'm going to take advantage
			of the time by visiting the
			Hatarian System. There are
			ancient ruins there just being
			excavated.
			The delay will also make it
			possible for Stellar Dynamics to
			complete their study of the Vodrey
			Nebula.
			I'll let them know they can have
			more access to the lateral sensor
			grid.
			This might be a good time to
			recalibrate the weapon targeting
			array.
			Mister Worf?
			Yes, sir. I will begin the
			procedure immediately.
			Very good.
			Dismissed.
			Lieutenant... could I have a word
			with you?
			Several times during the briefing
			you seemed a bit... distracted.
			I apologize. In the future, I
			will make sure my personal affairs
			do not interfere with my duties.
			Is everything all right?
			I... am having problems with
			Alexander. He has made it clear
			that he does not wish to
			participate in the First Rite of
			Ascension.
			I see...
			I have tried to tell him that it
			is an important part of a young
			Klington's life, but he does not
			understand...
			He's had so little opportunity to
			spend time among Klingons... I
			doubt if he fully appreciates what
			a rich cultural heritage he comes
			from.
			The festival of Kot'baval begins
			tomorrow. If he could take part
			in it, he would see that there is
			much more to Klingon life than
			what I have been able to show
			him... if only we were nearer the
			homeworld.
			What about the Klingon outpost on
			Maranga Four... I'm sure they'll
			celebrate the festival there.
			Yes... but the outpost is on the
			far side of the Vodrey Nebula, it
			is three days away by shuttle...
			The Enterprise could be there in
			a fraction of that time, and still
			be back here for our rendezvous.
			Sir, I could not ask you to --
			I'm willing to bet Stellar
			Dynamics would like nothing better
			than to make a trip around the
			Nebula; it'll give them the chance
			to study it that much more
			thoroughly.
			Bok'ta ku'mo. (over here)
			Who's that?
			That is the tyrant Molor. He was
			so strong that no one could stand
			against him.
			Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not... ?
			What's he saying?
			He is asking if anyone else will
			have the courage to stand up to
			Molor...
			Nok'tar be'got... ?
			Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!
			Ni'tokor bak'to!
			Ba'jak tu'mo!
			O'tak tu'ro!
			Nok'tar be'got?
			Hosh'ar te'not?
			Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!
			What's this... ?
			Jik'ta! You have wounded me!
			You fought well.
			What happens now?
			Only one man can stand against
			Molor.
			It's Kahless!
			Nok'til Kahless. Molor gik'tal!
			Kahless would rather die than live
			under Molor's tyranny...
			Ni'lot Kahless!
			Father --
			Where have you been?
			We were watching the fire dancers.
			We?
			K'Nor and Bar'el -- they live here
			on the outpost. I need some
			money.
			What for?
			There's a man over there who's got
			Molor's head in a box -- the real
			Molor.
			That is impossible. Molor died
			centuries ago.
			I know -- it's mummified. He said
			he'd show it to us for fifty
			darseks.
			He is trying to take your money.
			Please, Father. He's waiting.
			No. It is late. We should go
			home.
			But --
			Alexander.
			Come, it is time to go.
			I have to say goodbye.
			You can see your friends again
			tomorrow.
			We're coming back?
			If you want to.
			Alexander, run --
			Ni'tokor bak'to!
			K'pla, Worf. They were no match
			for us.
			I've seen you somewhere before.
			Who are you?
			A friend...
			Are you... K'mtar?
			Your brother sent me here to
			protect you...
			He is gin'tak to the house of
			Mogh...
			Gin'tak?
			An advisor so trusted that he is
			made part of a family.
			Do you have any idea who was
			behind the attack?
			It is a Klingon matter. Not your
			concern.
			One of my officers was almost
			killed. That makes it my concern.
			Recently rumors began to circulate
			on the homeworld that an
			assassination attempt was going to
			be made against the family of
			Mogh. Kurn sent me to make sure
			nothing happened to Worf.
			Why didn't you warn him before the
			attack was made?
			I tried to contact him by
			subspace, but was told Worf wasn't
			aboard. I decided to beam
			directly to the surface.
			One of the attackers dropped this
			dagger.
			The design... represents the house
			of Duras.
			We have other evidence that
			indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa
			and B'Etor, were behind the
			attack.
			What do you think they're after?
			Kurn's seat on the council, of
			course.
			We can not allow their attack on
			our house to go unanswered.
			First we have to find them... and
			they've been elusive.
			At one point they were at Deep
			Space Nine, trying to sell
			bilitrium explosives.
			That was months ago. No one knows
			where they went from there.
			Maybe we can find out.
			We've arranged quarters for you,
			if you'd like to stay aboard.
			I would. Worf and I have much to
			discuss.
			I'll send Kurn a message telling
			him what happened, but it will be
			days before he receives it -- he's
			gone to the Hitora colony as
			Gowron's representative.
			K'mtar, why did you treat
			Commander Riker so
			disrespectfully?
			You were... rude.
			I may have been rude by human
			standards, but I meant no
			disrespect.
			What's the matter Worf, have you
			been living among humans so long
			that you've forgotten how Klingons
			behave?
			I have not forgotten... I am
			merely pointing out that their
			ways our different from ours.
			I trust you've made your son aware
			of that fact, as well?
			Of course I have.
			Good. Because someday Alexander
			may be called upon to lead the
			house of Mogh. Kurn has no male
			heir, and he wants to be sure that
			Alexander is preparing himself.
			Does my brother doubt my ability
			to raise my son as a Klingon?
			No. But you are alone among
			humans. It cannot be easy to keep
			our ways.
			No... it has not been easy.
			How are his fighting skills? Can
			he handle a Bat'leth?
			He is learning... he could be
			better.
			He must be. He's not far from the
			age of ascension.
			Actually... Alexander has not
			committed himself to undergoing
			the rite.
			What?
			I have tried to make him see how
			important it is, but he will not
			listen to me.
			Perhaps together, you and I can
			find a way to spark the boy's
			interest in his heritage.
			I would be grateful for any help
			you could give.
			Tomorrow, then.
			May I say goodnight to him?
			Of course.
			Is this your mother?
			She died when I was little.
			You miss her a great deal, don't
			you... ?
			It must be hard for you... being
			the only Klingon your age on board
			this ship.
			Sometimes...
			Have you ever been to the
			homeworld?
			No...
			I think you'd like it there. At
			your uncle's house there is a lake
			where you can swim. The water is
			so clear you can see to the
			bottom.
			Really?
			And you have cousins there. They
			want to meet you.
			I don't know...
			I understand. You're afraid...
			you don't know if the Home World
			is safe.
			Yes...
			What happened today... on the
			planet... was frightening.
			You're still troubled...
			I thought they were going to kill
			my father.
			You must have wanted to help us
			fight them off.
			I didn't know what to do...
			Someday, if you work hard, you'll
			be a warrior... a Klingon warrior,
			and you'll always feel safe
			because you'll know how to defend
			yourself. And do you know what
			else? If anyone ever tries to
			hurt your father again, you'll be
			able to fight at his side and make
			sure nothing happens to him. What
			do you think of that?
			Good night, Alexander. Dream
			well.
			Good night, K'mtar.
			Any luck?
			Starfleet records contain no
			mention of the Duras sisters after
			their departure from Deep Space
			Nine.
			Didn't I tell you as much?
			Have you been able to make contact
			with Deep Space Nine?
			I am being patched through now,
			sir...
			On screen.
			Quark...
			I see you remember me.
			How could I forget the only man
			ever to win triple down dabo at
			one of my tables... ?
			And how could I forget that you
			didn't have enough latinum to
			cover my winnings?
			I thought I explained that my
			brother had misplaced the key to
			the safe. Besides, those vouchers
			I gave you are every bit as good
			as latinum.
			Not exactly. You can spend
			latinum just about anywhere.
			Those vouchers are only good at
			your bar.
			I look forward to seeing you upon
			your return...
			Is that what this is about...
			you're on your way and you're
			calling to reserve a Holosuite
			program... ?
			Actually, I was hoping you could
			help me with something else.
			What would that be... ?
			I'm looking for some Klingon
			friends of mine... the Duras
			sisters -- Lursa and B'Etor?
			Oh, yes... Lursa and B'Etor...
			Big talk... small tips.
			I thought you might know where
			they went.
			Me? What makes you think I'd
			know... ?
			Commander Sisko said if anyone
			would know, you would...
			He flatters me.
			Well... I did hear a rumor,
			actually...
			What kind of rumor?
			I don't know... I'm sure it was
			told to me in confidence...
			And how much is your "confidence"
			worth?
			How many vouchers do you have,
			again?
			Enough for twelve bars of latinum.
			I'll be glad to return them.
			Ah. I believe the rumor was...
			that the sisters were trying to
			buy some second-hand mining
			equipment.
			What for?
			They learned of a magnesite
			deposit in the Kalla system... it
			belongs to the Pakleds, but those
			fools don't even know it's there.
			Your friends were trying to get at
			it.
			All right.
			I'll send you those vouchers...
			Don't bother... I voided them
			while we've been talking.
			So long, Quark...
			How long would it take us to reach
			the Kalla system?
			Approximately sixteen hours.
			Couldn't he have been lying?
			Why would he? I'd just end up
			knocking on his door again in a
			few days -- and I wouldn't be in
			as good a mood.
			I congratulate you, Commander. I
			didn't think it would be possible
			to find the sisters.
			Take us out of orbit.
			Today we will work on the
			Koh'manara block... it is a
			combination of the koh'bala pivot
			and the pak'ara thrust -- the
			forms I taught you last week.
			Yes, Father...
			Alexander, have I not taught you
			to treat your sword with respect?
			You're not looking forward to
			training, are you?
			Not really...
			It can be boring repeating the
			same moves over and over again.
			You must master the forms before
			you can apply them.
			That's true, but I was thinking we
			might try something different
			today.
			I took the liberty of creating a
			Holodeck program.
			What kind of program?
			I'll show you...
			Computer... run program K'mtar
			alpha-one.
			Program initiated. Enter when
			ready.
			Why did you want to recreate this?
			You said you wished you'd been
			able to help your father fight,
			but you didn't know how...
			You've probably thought about the
			attack over and over again.
			Yes...
			Then let's see what happens this
			time.
			Computer, give us two Klingon
			warriors.
			How can I fight somebody that big?
			It is not size that matters.
			Cunning... skill... and
			observation are the most important
			weapons.
			Ni'tokor bak'to!
			Freeze program.
			Look what this ko'tal is doing.
			See his legs, they give a clue to
			what his next move will be.
			His weight is all on his right
			foot.
			Yes, he's going to have to shift
			it to regain his balance.
			Stand ready.
			Computer, resume program.
			Po'tajg! (well done)
			Finish him.
			Freeze program.
			You should have killed him when
			you had the chance.
			Why didn't you?
			I... I don't know...
			Look at him! He didn't care that
			you showed him mercy. He was
			going to kill you.
			K'mtar... enough.
			If this were real he'd be dead
			now.
			Alexander --
			We are approaching Kalla Three.
			Assume a standard orbit.
			Any evidence of a mining
			operation?
			A shaft has been cut through the
			outer crust... there is evidence
			of machinery, but it does not
			appear to be in use.
			Life signs?
			It is difficult to say. The
			magnesite is interfering with bioreadings.
			Assemble an Away Team.
			Who are you?
			Gorta... I'm Gorta...
			What are you doing on this planet?
			I... crashed here.
			Then you are denying involvement
			in illegal mining activities.
			Mining? So that's what all this
			equipment is for...
			I suspect that you are feigning
			ignorance.
			What a thing to say.
			We are looking for two Klingon
			women, sisters --
			Lursa! B'Etor? Do you know where
			they are?
			Actually we were hoping you did.
			Maybe I do...
			Would you be willing to share your
			information with us?
			My personal code of conduct
			prohibits sharing. But I'd
			consider a trade...
			Does your personal code of conduct
			tell you that when you're stranded
			on a planet with no way off, you
			shouldn't try to cut deals?
			You have a point.
			We could certainly provide you
			with passage off this planet in
			exchange for information.
			Could you perhaps... fail to tell
			the Pakleds that we were mining
			their ore?
			Don't push your luck.
			But if you can get us to the Duras
			sisters, I'll see what I can do.
			The Duras sisters... they are
			magnificent, aren't they?
			Where are they now?
			Selling the ore, I imagine. They
			took everything, the ore, the
			ship...
			Such treachery... I can't help but
			adore them.
			What kind of ship do they have?
			A Bird of Prey. With a working
			cloaking device. Who knows how
			they got hold of that...
			And where have they gone?
			We were going to sell the ore to
			a Yridian trader. We were
			supposed to meet him in the Ufandi
			system.
			Gather your belongings. It is
			time to leave.
			Like I said... they took
			everything.
			Worf...
			I'm sorry about what happened. I
			shouldn't have gotten so angry.
			It's just that... I'm worried
			about Alexander.
			As am I.
			Kurn told me that his mother
			actively discouraged him from
			exploring his Klingon heritage...
			When he came to live with me, he
			knew nothing of our ways.
			He often reminds me of things his
			mother said to him... I try not to
			disregard her wishes, I want him
			to honor her memory...
			Someday... I'm sure he'll
			appreciate you. And be grateful
			for all you've given him.
			Still, compared to other boys his
			age, Alexander's fighting skills
			are years behind.
			I know. He has not put in the
			time he needs to learn the skills.
			I think you should consider
			sending him to the training
			Academy on Ogat. Your brother is
			an influential man; he could see
			to it that Alexander was admitted.
			Send him... to Ogat?
			I'm only thinking of what's best
			for him. At the Academy he'd
			learn our ways, he'd live like a
			Klingon.
			I want him to learn our ways,
			but... this is his home.
			How can you expect him to lead our
			house someday when all he's known
			is life aboard a Federation
			starship?
			He is my son; he belongs with me.
			The boy is more human than
			Klingon. If he stays here, he'll
			never be a warrior. He'll never
			be able to defend our family
			against its enemies.
			Enough... the decision is mine.
			Not necessarily. It would be
			within my rights to invoke ya'nora
			kor.
			You would challenge my fitness to
			raise my own son?
			For the good of our house, yes.
			Worf... I beg you... stop thinking
			of yourself. It's Alexander we
			must consider.
			Look into your heart... and do
			what's best for him.
			-- if K'mtar invoked ya'nora kor,
			your vote would cancel his, and it
			would be up to your brother to
			decide who would get custody of
			Alexander.
			I am confident my brother would
			not vote against me.
			You don't sound confident...
			Perhaps I should let Alexander
			know what is at stake... it might
			induce him to spend more time
			training.
			I'm not sure that's a good idea...
			it might scare him.
			I should have tried harder... I
			should have taken him to visit the
			homeworld...
			Worf... Alexander is part human,
			and that part of him is every bit
			as important as his Klingon side.
			I think you've done a wonderful
			job of exposing him to both sides
			of his heritage.
			But by doing that, I may have made
			it impossible for him to be
			accepted as a true Klingon.
			There are those who'd say you're
			not a true Klingon, just because
			you wear that uniform.
			The truth is you've found a
			balance within yourself, a balance
			that feels right to you. You have
			to trust that Alexander will be
			able to find his own balance.
			Just as you did.
			Part of me wants to give him that
			freedom... but what if he turns
			away from his Klingon heritage?
			What will happen to my father's
			house? Who will lead it?
			-- Kahless was determined to teach
			his brother a lesson for having
			told a lie, but Morath refused to
			fight his brother, and instead ran
			away. Kahless pursued him across
			valleys and over mountains, all
			the way to the edge of the sea.
			And there on the shore, they
			fought for --
			Twelve days and twelve nights. I
			know, I've heard this story
			before.
			Alexander, it is important to tell
			these stories, even if we already
			know them.
			Why was Kahless so mad about the
			lie his brother told?
			Because it made him look like a
			coward.
			If Kahless had just let him
			explain what happened, maybe they
			wouldn't have had to fight about
			it.
			You are missing the point --
			And I don't see what's so wrong
			with running away -- maybe Morath
			didn't want to fight his brother
			because he didn't want to have to
			kill him.
			He ran because he was a coward --
			How do you know that's why?
			No more questions! These are our
			stories. A warrior must learn how
			to interpret them properly.
			I'm trying to --
			No, your head is full of foolish
			human notions about the way things
			are. You are Klingon. You must
			begin to act like one.
			I'm part human, too.
			Listen to me, Alexander... when a
			human looks at you, he doesn't see
			himself, he sees a Klingon.
			It doesn't matter what I look
			like.
			It does. You're different from
			everyone aboard this ship. And no
			matter how much people pretend
			otherwise, they'll always see you
			as different.
			That's not true...
			It is. The only way you'll ever
			feel like you really belong, is if
			you leave here and go live with
			your own kind.
			I know a Klingon school you could
			go to; you'd be welcome there.
			They'd teach you how to be a
			warrior -- prepare you for the
			Rite of Ascension.
			I don't know if I want to do
			that...
			After you've been there a while...
			you'll find you won't want to do
			anything else.
			But I don't want to leave the
			Enterprise --
			You must! Everything depends on
			it.
			I thought you were different. I
			thought you understood me. But
			you don't. You're just like my
			Father. All you care about is me
			becoming a warrior. Why don't you
			just leave me alone!
			First Officer's Log, stardate
			47779.4. We've entered the Ufandi
			system, where we believe the Duras
			sisters might have come to sell
			the ore they mined on Kalla Three.
			I am detecting a vessel holding
			position near the third planet...
			It is a Yridian freighter.
			Put it on screen.
			Scan for magnesite in its hold.
			The resonance signature indicates
			that there is magnesite ore
			present...
			Then we're too late. The sisters
			have already been here.
			Somehow I doubt the Yridians are
			going to be very forthcoming about
			where they might have gone...
			Sir, readings indicate that there
			are only five hundred kilograms of
			ore in the Yridian's hold...
			There should be over ten thousand
			kilograms...
			That's odd...
			Hail them.
			I'm Commander Riker of the
			Federation Starship Enterprise.
			I am Yog... why are we speaking?
			Our sensors indicate you're
			carrying magnesite ore...
			Magnesite, yes.
			Where did you get it?
			From a Corvallen. For a good
			price.
			Where's this... Corvallen now? I
			have orders to acquire some
			magnesite.
			He is gone...
			Where? I don't know.
			Wouldn't you be interested in
			selling me the ore you're
			carrying?
			No, I have a buyer.
			You haven't heard my offer.
			Half a gram of Anjoran bio-mimetic
			gel.
			Done.
			Once we've verified the ore's
			purity, we'll beam over the gel.
			You're up to something...
			Have the Transporter Room beam the
			ore to these coordinates.
			Sir, that would place the ore
			directly off the ship's starboard
			bow.
			I know.
			Transport complete.
			Lock phasers on the ore and fire.
			Firing.
			A Bird of Prey...
			Put a tractor beam on it.
			How did you know?
			The Yridians had only part of the
			shipment in their hold -- I
			realized we must've arrived before
			they had the chance to transfer
			the rest.
			Sir, the Klingon ship is hailing
			us.
			On screen.
			Release our vessel at once!
			I don't think so.
			We've done nothing wrong. We were
			engaging in a simple business
			transaction.
			We know you're dealing in stolen
			ore.
			But what I really want to talk
			about is the assassination attempt
			on Lieutenant Worf.
			What assassination attempt? This
			is the first I've heard of it.
			Did it succeed?
			We have evidence that you were
			behind it.
			That is outrageous.
			What is this evidence?
			Beam over and we'll show you.
			We will be there shortly.
			This was dropped by one of the
			assassins...
			It bears the crest of your house.
			Ge'ko... kaf'la. (It's true. How
			can this be?)
			Someone must have given it to the
			assassins -- to implicate us.
			Why would someone do that?
			In order to tarnish our good name.
			You can't tarnish a rusted
			blade...
			Ji'ko to'val!
			Gir'nak tovo'sor!
			Mister Worf --
			You said you had other evidence
			they were involved.
			Yes... on the homeworld.
			Then we'll set a course there. I
			want this cleared up.
			I will send a message to Kurn...
			he may wish to return to the
			homeworld as well.
			Bet'ala nog'tor. (look at this)
			Impossible...
			What is it?
			These markings represent the
			members of our house...
			This symbol represents our
			father...
			Myself, my sister... and this...
			represents her son.
			I was not aware you had a son.
			I do not... But I am with child...
			She found out only a few days
			ago... and she's told no one but
			me.
			How can this marking be here?
			Where did this come from... ?
			I will talk to K'mtar.
			No further.
			K'mtar... why are you doing this?
			Step away from the door.
			You will have to kill me.
			I won't do that. But I can stun
			you -- then kill the boy.
			What?
			I... am Alexander.
			What... are you saying?
			I... am your son... Alexander...
			I have come to this time from
			forty years in the future.
			P'tak! Tell me the truth or I
			will kill you.
			Look at me!
			You said when you first met me
			that I looked familiar.
			I could have seen you on the
			Homeworld...
			No. Look closely. I am your son.
			If you are Alexander... you will
			remember the final words your
			mother said as she died.
			I was three years old. She was
			dying when we found her. She
			barely managed to whisper my
			name... and she took my hand...
			and placed it in yours.
			Then she died. You howled with
			rage... and then you told me to
			look at her... to look at death...
			and always to remember.
			And I always have.
			How... have you done this? Come
			to this time?
			Forty years from now the ways are
			well known. But few are willing
			to risk the dangers.
			I decided I must take the risk.
			And you did it... in order to end
			your own life?
			I was hoping I wouldn't have to...
			that I could change things, change
			myself. But I couldn't.
			Everything's going to turn out the
			way it did before. And I can't
			let that happen.
			Why? What is going to happen that
			is so terrible?
			You will be killed. Because I was
			naive... too weak... to be able to
			protect you.
			I don't believe that...
			I was there! I saw you
			murdered... and I was to blame.
			You mustn't blame yourself.
			You don't understand -- I never
			became a warrior! I became a
			diplomat... a "peacemaker."
			When the time came for me to lead
			our family -- I thought I could
			single-handedly put an end to the
			fighting between the great
			houses... I declared publicly
			that the house of Mogh would take
			the first step to end the feuding.
			There would be no more
			retribution, no more revenge.
			You tried to warn me... you tried
			to tell me that I mustn't show
			weakness... but I thought you
			were a foolish old man. I told
			you that you were a relic of an
			earlier time, and that a new era
			of peace was at hand.
			But you were right. My enemies
			saw my weakness... and they moved
			against me.
			Unless I stop it all now...
			-- that boy will see his father
			killed on the floor of the Council
			Chamber.
			That's why you wanted to take
			Alexander away. To turn him into
			a warrior, not a peacemaker.
			I staged the assassination attempt
			to frighten him... make him
			realize he must learn the ways of
			a warrior.
			If I had listened to you... if I
			had become the warrior you
			wanted... you would not have died
			in my arms.
			Who is to say what the future will
			be now, after you have disrupted
			time? I may die tomorrow... or I
			may outlive you.
			But when I die... I would like an
			honorable death. And the only way
			that is possible -- is for you
			accept yourself, as you are, and
			stay true to what you believe.
			The cause of peace is a worthy
			one... go back, and continue to
			work for it. Your struggle must
			continue.
			But it is a futile struggle...
			No... you've already changed
			things more than you realize.
			The boy I was has not changed...
			I'm talking about myself.
			You have given me a glimpse into
			my son's future. I see now that
			he has his own destiny... and I
			believe it will be a great one...
			I love you, Father...
			And I you, Alexander...
			I've been waiting -- where's
			K'mtar?
			He had to leave... he was called
			away...
			He never said goodbye.
			He asked me to say goodbye for
			him.
			He wanted me to tell you that no
			matter what happens, no matter
			what you decide to do with your
			life, he'll always care about you
			a great deal.
			When will I see him again?
			It may be a long time...
			We should start practice...
			Alexander... there will be plenty
			of time for training. Why don't
			we... just spend some time
			together?
