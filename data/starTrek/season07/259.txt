			Captain's Log, Stardate 47254.1.
			A delegation of the Cairn have
			just come on board. This
			telepathic species has no concept
			of spoken language, and is being
			instructed in its use by... an
			old friend.
			I don't know what they'd have done
			without me. First, I had to learn
			how they communicate. It was an
			absolutely exhausting process...
			It must have been.
			Quite different from Betazoid
			telepathy. We transmit words...
			with the Cairn...
			... it's images. A flood of them,
			all at the same time. It's
			overwhelming...
			I can imagine...
			It's actually a very efficient way
			of communicating. If two Cairn
			were having this conversation it
			would have been over minutes ago.
			Really?
			But of course they realize they'll
			want to communicate verbally if
			they join the Federation.
			Do me a favor... introduce
			yourself to one of them and engage
			him in conversation -- they need
			the practice.
			I'd be happy to.
			... it's called a VISOR. It lets
			me see things.
			Like my vocal enhancer.
			It lets me make sounds.
			I see you've met my star pupil.
			Hedril has picked up spoken
			language much faster than the
			others.
			It is often the case that children
			learn languages more easily than
			adults.
			Deanna was quite good at languages
			when she was little.
			Where is Deanna?
			Should be here someplace...
			Hedril, darling...
			What?
			Go find your father, dear. I want
			to talk to him.
			Mrs. Troi, are you all right?
			Yes... yes... just a little tired.
			This constant telepathy with the
			Cairn...
			I'm fine, really.
			Aren't you going to mingle, Mister
			Woof?
			I do not care for telepaths. They
			make me... uneasy.
			Don't worry -- The Cairn couldn't
			read your thoughts even if they
			wanted to. Your brain isn't
			sophisticated enough.
			Neither is yours, dear. They can
			only communicate with other
			telepaths.
			Has either of you seen Deanna?
			She was working, but she said
			she'd be here -- ah -- speak of
			the devil.
			Sorry I'm late. I lost track of
			the time.
			Deanna, dear, come with me. I
			want you to meet the senior
			diplomat of the Cairn delegation.
			Maques...
			This is the beautiful daughter
			I've been telling you about --
			Deanna.
			Pleased to...
			Hello.
			Hello.
			Pleased to meet you.
			Yes, that is it. Pleased to meet
			you, Deanna.
			Well, I'll just let you young
			people chat...
			Well, Maques... what do you think
			of the Enterprise?
			It is... --
			-- beautiful... comfortable, also.
			I'm glad you think so.
			There is another word... a word
			that describes it... but... I
			cannot remember.
			You've learned a great deal in a
			very short time. I'm sure it
			won't be long before your words
			will do justice to your thoughts.
			Your Mother has... told me... of
			your need.
			Need?
			A moment...
			Husband. You need a husband.
			I need a wife.
			Deanna!
			Good morning...
			So what did you think of Maques?
			Why did you do that, Mother? You
			embarrassed both of us.
			He's really very sweet. And
			lonely. Poor man, a widower,
			raising a child alone.
			Please, Mother... don't start.
			I just think it's time for you to
			settle down. If your Father were
			still alive I'm sure he'd say the
			same thing.
			But you'll do exactly what you
			want...
			Just like always...
			Stop it, mother.
			Are you coming?
			What's wrong... ?
			You're so precious to me. You're
			all I've got. If something
			happened to you I don't know what
			I'd do...
			Nothing's going to happen to me...
			You'd better go...
			My first appointment isn't for a
			few minutes... why don't we talk
			for a while?
			I'm fine... I'm just tired from
			working with the Cairn and it's
			making me emotional.
			Are you sure?
			Go on... I'll see you later...
			Go on.
			Maques...
			I wanted to... apologize... for
			yesterday.
			You don't have to --
			My words... they were... confused.
			It wasn't your fault. My mother
			misled you.
			Not in everything... she has an
			image of you... in her mind --
			-- she shared it with me...
			You are even more beautiful...
			The way my people communicate...
			It is... direct. Nothing is
			hidden.
			Yes.
			Your Mother is... the first... to
			learn our telepathy...
			You mean you've never had
			telepathy with someone who wasn't
			Cairn?
			No...
			To communicate with her is... very
			different.
			In what way?
			Always... there is a part of
			her... a part of her that is...
			dark.
			Dark?
			A part of her that... can not be
			seen. Do you understand?
			I'm not sure...
			Did you ask my Mother about this?
			She called it... a moment...
			Privacy.
			Of course.
			You said that among the Cairn,
			nothing is hidden. We value
			honesty, but we don't always share
			everything we're thinking and
			feeling.
			This is... privacy?
			Yes.
			It is... normal?
			For us, yes.
			If this is your way... I am...
			relieved.
			It is our way.
			I will leave now.
			I'm glad you stopped by.
			I am glad to have stopped also.
			I was all set for another round of
			arguing when all of a sudden she
			just... fell apart.
			She's been under a lot of stress,
			preparing the Cairn to meet with
			the Federation Council.
			It's more than that. I've been
			sensing very... erratic emotions
			from her. Even the clothes she's
			wearing seem unusual -- very
			subdued.
			Maybe you better have a talk with
			her --
			Commander --
			Take your hands off her.
			Mrs. Troi --
			Don't "Mrs. Troi" me.
			Mother!
			Why don't you leave her alone? If
			it weren't for you she'd be
			married by now.
			That's enough.
			I'm warning you, stay away from
			her!
			You're coming with me --
			I don't know what got into me.
			Please tell Wil how sorry I am.
			She's fine, except her psilosynine
			levels are a little low.
			Psilosynine?
			That's a neurotransimitter
			involved in telepathy.
			It's been depleted by your work
			with the Cairn. You're going to
			have to avoid telepathic
			communication for a while.
			I can't -- We only have three days
			left and the Cairn still have so
			much to learn.
			I'm sorry, but you're going to
			have to take some time and rest.
			Maybe I can help with the Cairn.
			You're only half-Betazoid, dear.
			And you don't have any experience
			with their form of telepathy.
			Then I won't use telepathy; we'll
			work verbally.
			I suppose we could do that...
			And if they don't understand
			something I'll explain it to them
			telepathically.
			No, you'll work verbally too. The
			point is for you to rest.
			Besides, it'll be good for them to
			have to figure things out with
			words.
			Well... I suppose you're right.
			This is the ship's arboretum.
			Arbor means tree.
			Very good, Hedril. People like to
			come here to relax, enjoy
			themselves in a natural setting.
			"Flowers of all hue, and without
			thorn the rose... "
			That's from an old earth poem by
			John Milton.
			Please... what is a... poem?
			Poetry is... an art-form that uses
			words, put together in new and
			unexpected ways -- sometimes in
			rhyme.
			Milton was speculating that in
			Heaven, roses wouldn't have
			thorns.
			Heaven... ?
			Heaven is... it's a...
			I see. Yes, thank you. "Heaven."
			Mother, you're supposed to be
			avoiding telepathy.
			I was just trying to help, dear.
			You don't look well.
			I'm just tired -- maybe I'll sit
			down...
			Don't worry... she'll be fine...
			Mother!
			Mother... ?
			Troi to Sickbay... medical
			emergency in the arboretum...
			She's not responding to cortical
			stimulation. I'm not sure what
			more I can do...
			I don't understand... she was fine
			just yesterday.
			I've never seen anything like
			this. It's almost as if her brain
			has... shut itself down.
			Is there any physiological cause?
			I'm running a sub-neural scan, but
			as far as I can see there's no
			tissue damage, no neuro-chemical
			imbalance, no sign of infection --
			nothing.
			Yet her neural activity is
			practically non-existent.
			The only exception is in the
			paracortex -- activity there is
			almost off the scale.
			The paracortex is the Betazoid
			telepathic lobe.
			She communicated with Maques
			telepathically just before she
			fell...
			Might there be some side-effect of
			Cairn telepathy that we're not
			aware of?
			It's a possibility.
			I think you and I had better have
			a talk with Maques.
			I am very...
			apologetic -- for what has
			happened to your Mother.
			Maques, is it possible that your
			telepathic communications with
			Mrs. Troi harmed her in some way?
			No... I tried to... to explain...
			before.
			Bad thoughts... they hurt her...
			What thoughts, Maques? Take your
			time...
			Inside her... the dark place...
			I don't understand.
			She is... what are the words... I
			don't have the words...
			Counsellor --
			Stop it!
			It's all right, Captain.
			I'm fine... He was just trying to
			communicate with me
			telepathically.
			Do you understand now?
			I... I'm not sure...
			He communicated so much to me that
			at first it was just a jumble of
			images.
			Have you been able to sort any of
			it out?
			I think so... during his
			telepathic contact with my Mother,
			Maques sensed what he calls a
			"dark place."
			He tried to tell me about it
			before, in my office. I
			misunderstood, I thought he was
			talking about thoughts she was
			keeping private. What he meant
			was that something was happening
			in her meta-conscious mind.
			Meta-conscious?
			It's a part of the Betazoid
			psyche. A kind of... filtering
			mechanism to protect us from
			psychic trauma.
			Is Maques suggesting that
			Lwaxana's meta-conscious is
			damaged somehow?
			He feels that whatever is wrong
			with her is centered there. If
			he's right... that may mean that
			she's suffered some kind of trauma
			that her meta-conscious can't
			tolerate.
			Did your Mother mention anything
			that happened to her lately,
			something that might have been
			traumatic for her?
			No. Nothing like that.
			Maques could be wrong about this.
			There's still a chance that the
			sub-neural scan will pinpoint an
			physiological cause for your
			Mother's condition, something I'll
			be able to treat.
			The results won't be in until
			morning; maybe we should all get
			some rest.
			I'd like to stay here with her...
			I'm going to try to contact her
			telepathically.
			All right.
			Mother... can you hear me... ?
			Please come back to me...
			please...
			Help me...
			Mother... ?
			Help me...
			How? How can I help you?
			Tell me, Mother. Please.
			Computer, lights!
			What are you doing?
			What were you doing in Sickbay,
			Maques?
			Helping... trying to help
			Lwaxana...
			How... what were you trying to do?
			I was... she is...
			You, Deanna. Maybe you --
			I don't understand.
			You must... how can I explain...
			Tell me, telepathically.
			Maques believes my Mother's psyche
			has... collapsed in on itself --
			that for some reason, she's
			retreated into her meta-conscious
			mind.
			Was he trying to contact her
			telepathically?
			Yes. He was able to access images
			being generated by her meta-conscious
			mind. But he couldn't
			make any sense of them...
			I did not... understand...
			He saw faces he didn't recognize,
			events he couldn't interpret.
			If we could decipher those images,
			it might help us determine whether
			or not your Mother's condition was
			induced by some traumatic event.
			Maques believes he can provide
			a... telepathic "bridge" that
			will allow me to access her meta-conscious.
			If he can, I might be
			able to find out what happened to
			her.
			If you succeed, would you be able
			to use that information to help
			your Mother?
			I'm not sure. But I do know that
			some part of her wants to be
			helped. When I tried to contact
			her telepathically, I heard a
			voice calling out to me.
			If her psyche has... "collapsed in
			on itself," could accessing her
			mind pose any danger to you?
			There's no way to know.
			Sir, I'd like to try...
			I'll be monitoring her through the
			whole procedure. If anything goes
			wrong, Maques can break the
			telepathic link.
			Your Mother -- part of her is...
			very frightened. She may...
			resist you.
			I understand.
			Help me...
			Mother... ?
			Help me...
			Counselor... can you hear me... ?
			Captain... ?
			Deanna... Doctor Crusher is
			concerned that your para-cortical
			readings have become erratic.
			Are you... talking to me from
			Sickbay?
			Yes. I want you to sever your
			connection to your Mother.
			Why don't you ask Maques to do it?
			I'm asking you.
			That's an order, Counselor.
			You're not Captain Picard.
			Leave me alone... please...
			This isn't real... none of this is
			real...
			Daddy... ?
			Deanna...
			Look at you... you've become a
			beautiful woman...
			Don't do this...
			I'm sorry I had to go away when
			you were so little... I didn't
			want to...
			You're not my father... you're a
			part of Mother's mind...
			What is this place?
			It's our house near Lake El'nar,
			on Betazed. We used to live here.
			Deanna -- let's not waste this
			chance. I want to hear everything
			that's happened to you...
			Did I live here?
			For a while... when you were a
			baby. You were such a beautiful
			baby... Your mother and I loved
			you so much...
			I don't remember these toys...
			I'll bet you don't remember me
			singing you to sleep at night,
			either... but I did.
			I do remember... I always felt
			safe when you sang to me...
			There was one song you always
			asked me to sing... you couldn't
			fall asleep unless you heard
			it....
			Down in the valley...
			Valley so low... hang your head
			over.... hear the wind blow --
			No... no... you're trying to keep
			me here... keep me from finding
			something...
			Your Mother doesn't want to see
			you, Deanna.
			I have to help her...
			If you want to help her... leave.
			Let her have peace.
			But... she called out to me....
			she does want my help.
			Stay with me... just a little
			while... it's been so long --
			we'll never have this chance
			again.
			Goodbye, daddy.
			Hedril... ?
			Mother...
			Get away from here!
			No!
			I asked your Father to bring you
			here because I wanted to talk to
			you about something.
			You know that Lwaxana is sick,
			don't you?
			Yes.
			Is it my fault?
			No... not at all. But... I
			believe my Mother has been
			thinking about you. Do you know
			why?
			I make her sad.
			Why do you say that?
			Because it's true.
			Do you have any idea why Hedril
			would make my Mother sad?
			No.
			Thank you for coming to talk to
			us. I'll see you later, all
			right?
			I hope your mother gets better.
			Thank you, Hedril. So do I.
			I just don't understand how she
			fits in to all this...
			I still haven't been able to find
			a physiological cause for what's
			happened to your Mother. That
			makes me think that Maques was
			right, that her condition was
			precipitated by some traumatic
			event.
			Could this event have involved
			Hedril?
			I don't think so. My Mother never
			mentioned her.
			Does your mother make personal
			logs... or keep a journal?
			Yes, she does. I'll contact
			Mister Homn on Betazed and ask him
			to transmit a copy as soon as
			possible. Maybe there's a clue
			there...
			Perhaps we are being too literal.
			In my recent study of dream
			analysis, I learned that people
			who appear in a dream can
			sometimes represent different
			aspects of the person who is
			dreaming.
			That's right... a child might
			represent vulnerability. Maybe
			Hedril depicts some fragile part
			of my mother.
			A part that she's protecting...
			... you said everything you
			encountered when you were in her
			mind was a barrier of one kind or
			another...
			Yes... you, the wolf, my father...
			as though she were summoning all
			her defenses to keep me away.
			But away from what? What is she
			protecting?
			Come in.
			Counselor...
			Hello, Captain.
			I've just been in Sickbay. Doctor
			Crusher feels your mother's
			condition is deteriorating... her
			neural functions are getting
			weaker.
			Have you had any luck here?
			No, nothing. I've gone through
			her belongings... and read her
			journal from the last five
			years...
			... and other than the fact that
			I'm not married yet, nothing bad
			seems to have happened to her.
			Is this your Father?
			Yes...
			He had a kind face...
			I remember when he died, my Mother
			had to go through all his things
			and pack them away... I was
			seven... and I remember thinking
			that he'd be mad when he came home
			and saw what she'd done.
			I didn't understand that he wasn't
			coming back...
			Deanna... your Mother might still
			come out of this.
			If we can't figure out what's
			wrong with her -- I don't think
			she will.
			But I don't know what to do. I've
			talked with Mister Homn, who's
			known her for years. I've checked
			her medical records. I've made
			enquiries to the government on
			Betazed and I've contacted several
			of her close friends. If she
			suffered some kind of psychic
			trauma, there's just no evidence
			of it.
			You said you'd reviewed her
			journals for the past five years.
			Perhaps we should go further back.
			There's a lot to review. My
			mother's kept a journal since she
			was first married...
			Well, let's start at the
			beginning.
			The first entry seems to be
			Stardate 30620.1.
			That's the year they were married.
			This is odd... there's a seven
			year gap.
			It starts about a year after my
			parents were married...
			And if I'm not mistaken, it ends
			a few months after your birth.
			My Mother has always been so
			diligent about her journal -- why
			would she have stopped making
			entries for so long?
			She didn't. The files were
			deleted.
			By your Mother... almost thirty
			years ago.
			I don't understand any of this...
			Captain, I have to go back in to
			my mother's mind. That's the only
			way we're ever going to get any
			answers.
			Deanna... you understand that if
			your para-cortical readings go too
			high again, I'll have to tell
			Maques to sever the connection.
			I know.
			Hedril, be careful...
			Who is Hedril?
			Wait! I want to talk to you --
			Help me...
			Help me...
			Mother... ?
			Go away.
			No... I want to help you.
			Why did you delete parts of your
			journal?
			Did something happen to you --
			something you don't want me to
			know about?
			Leave me alone... please...
			Who is Hedril, Mother? Why is she
			here?
			Is Hedril me -- when I was a
			little girl?
			No -- I would never let anything
			happen to you... never.
			Did you let something happen to
			someone... ?
			Was it here, at El'nar?
			You were just a baby...
			Tell me; whatever it is we can
			face it together.
			I can't...
			You can... we can.
			Help me...
			Help me, papa...
			Please... don't make me go through
			this again...
			Here...
			Now hold on to him, don't let him
			run off.
			I won't...
			Mommy, can we go play by the
			water?
			No, Kestra... stay here with us...
			Please?
			Kestra, you woke your sister.
			Kestra... ?
			Don't cry, Deanna... mommy's
			here..
			Please, mommy?
			No, Kestra... we're going to eat
			in just a few minutes...
			What's wrong, little one... what's
			wrong... ?
			She's teething, Ian... where's her
			ring... ?
			In your bag, I think...
			Mommy's going to make it all
			better...
			I can't find it -- are you sure
			it's in here?
			No, I don't want to see this again --
			I can't --
			What happened, Mother. What
			happened next?
			I don't remember --
			You have to. You can't hold it
			back -- it's killing you.
			The dog got away... she ran after
			him... we didn't notice... until
			it was too late...
			The current was too strong...
			Kestra...
			Why did I look away... why wasn't
			I paying attention... ?
			You have to forgive yourself,
			Mother... you have to let go...
			How can I? I let her die...
			It was a terrible tragedy -- the
			worst thing that can happen to any
			parent... I know you feel
			responsible... but it was an
			accident...
			And what you're doing isn't fair
			to Kestra...
			I saw a little girl who was sweet
			and happy... she must have brought
			a great deal of joy into your
			lives...
			She woke up every morning with a
			smile...
			Then isn't it better to remember
			her like that?
			I've just found out I had a sister
			I never knew... I'd like to
			remember what was good and joyous
			about her... to celebrate her
			life, not mourn it...
			But when she died... the pain was
			so awful...
			I know. And you shut it away
			inside you all these years. But
			hiding it didn't make it go away.
			It's still there, hurting you...
			and it will stay there unless you
			can forgive yourself and move on.
			How? How can I do that?
			Kestra was here, a few moments
			ago. Talk to her...
			No --
			Do it. Tell her how you feel.
			I'm here with you. I'll help you.
			Mommy...
			Kestra...
			Oh, Kestra... my precious one...
			I'm so sorry...
			I have to go now...
			I know...
			Kestra always wanted to help take
			care of you... she was never the
			slightest bit jealous of all the
			attention you got.
			She sounds very sweet...
			I made your father promise never
			to speak of her... it was a
			terrible thing to ask... but he
			went along with it.
			If it hadn't been for your work
			with the Cairn, the strain of the
			telepathic contact, you might have
			been able to repress the memory
			forever.
			And if it hadn't been for you --
			I might have died trying to keep
			that dreadful secret.
			I contacted Mister Homn and told
			him you were all right. He asked
			me to give you something.
			I remember the day I took this...
			Mister Homn said he saved it... in
			case someday you wanted to
			remember her...
			I wish you could have known her,
			Deanna. I wish you two could have
			grown up together...
			Tell me about her.. I want to know
			everything.
