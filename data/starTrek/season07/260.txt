			Captain's Log: Stardate 47304.2.
			The Enterprise has arrived at
			Kesprytt Three in order to
			evaluate an unusual request on the
			part of the Kes for associate
			membership in the Federation.
			She's been very secretive... every
			time I ask her about it or try to
			edge around the subject, she
			changes the subject. Personally,
			I think she's in love.
			Mmmmm.
			Didn't you hear me? I said, she's
			in love.
			Yes?
			Is that all you can say?
			What would you like me to say?
			I'm very pleased for them both.
			Both of who?
			The two... people we were
			discussing.
			You don't have the slightest idea
			who I'm talking about, do you?
			No... no, I'm sorry... but I
			really don't.
			I'll try not to take that
			personally... I've been talking
			about Nurse Ogawa and Ensign
			Markson for almost fifteen
			minutes.
			Oh, now it hasn't been that long.
			How would you know? You haven't
			heard a thing I've said since I
			got here.
			You're right. I'm sorry.
			Are you worried about this mission
			with the Kes?
			Not worried exactly... just
			uneasy. This notion of admitting
			half of their planet to the
			Federation while leaving the other
			half out...
			Well, first of all, the Kes are
			not half the planet, they're
			almost three-quarters of it. And
			the Prytt are not being left out --
			they simply don't want any outside
			contact with the Federation or
			anyone else.
			Every member of the Federation has
			entered as a unified world... and
			that unity said something about
			them... that they had resolved
			certain social and political
			problems at home and were ready to
			join a larger community.
			From all indications, the Kes are
			a very unified, very progressive
			people.
			But the Prytt are not. They are
			reclusive to the point of
			xenophobia.
			Think about Earth -- what if one
			of the old nation-states, say
			Australia, had decided not to join
			the World Government in twenty-one
			fifty? Would that have
			disqualified us from being a
			Federation member?
			That analogy is not entirely --
			Riker to Captain.
			Go ahead, Number One.
			We've received word from
			Ambassador Mauric that he's ready
			to see you and Doctor Crusher.
			Inform him we're on our way.
			Acknowledged.
			Thank you for breakfast.
			Wait until tomorrow... I have
			something very special planned.
			It's a Vulcan dish -- that's all
			I'll tell you.
			Captain. Doctor. I have the
			coordinates of Ambassador Mauric's
			chambers.
			Let's not keep them waiting,
			Mister Worf.
			Enterprise to Kes Security Relay
			Station One. We're ready to
			commence transport.
			Acknowledged, Enterprise. We have
			lowered our defense shield.
			Confirmed.
			Energize.
			This is Security Relay Station
			One. We are ready to receive your
			Captain and Medical Officer.
			This is the Enterprise. We have
			completed the transport sequence.
			You should have them.
			Negative, Enterprise. They are
			not here.
			Beverly... Beverly...
			What happened?
			I don't know.
			The last thing I remember... was
			beginning the transport...
			I would assume that we're on
			Kesprytt... in some kind of
			prison cell.
			The question is why? I can't
			imagine that Ambassador Mauric
			would --
			Jean-Luc.
			What is it?
			I'm not sure.
			It's an implant... looks like it
			might be connected directly to the
			brainstem.
			Some kind of coercive device... ?
			Whatever they are... I doubt
			they're designed for our health.
			Why are we being held?
			If you tell us why you've taken us
			hostage, we might be able to --
			You are not hostages. You are
			prisoners.
			Prisoners. By whose authority?
			You are being held under the
			authority of the Prytt Security
			Ministry. The charge is
			conspiring with the enemy.
			The enemy... you mean the Kes.
			We are not fools. We are aware of
			the Federation attempt to
			establish a military alliance with
			the Kes. It will not be
			tolerated.
			Your information is in error.
			There are no plans to enter into
			any --
			There is no point in trying to
			mislead us, Captain. The devices
			which have been implanted in your
			cerebral cortexes will soon be
			calibrated to your psi-wave
			patterns. At that time, we will
			get all the information we need.
			And you will discover that we're
			telling the truth.
			We shall see.
			There is nothing wrong with the
			Transporter. I have run a
			complete diagnostic and checked
			all the targeting components.
			Then what happened to the Captain
			and Doctor Crusher?
			Commander. The Transporter sensor
			log shows an unusual concentration
			of antigraviton particles in the
			emitter coil. These particles do
			not occur naturally -- something
			must have interfered with the
			Transporter.
			Interfered?
			A concentration of antigraviton
			particles would suggest a tractor
			beam. It might have deflected the
			Transporter beam to a different
			set of coordinates.
			Is there a way to locate those
			coordinates?
			No, sir.
			However, it may be possible to
			determine the point of origin of
			the tractor beam itself.
			Well, that's a start.
			The tractor beam originated from
			somewhere within the Prytt
			Alliance.
			The Prytt... things just got a
			little more complicated.
			Can we scan for them?
			Prytt territory is shielded by a
			high-energy forcefield. It cannot
			be penetrated by our sensors.
			Why would the Prytt want Captain
			Picard and Doctor Crusher?
			I don't know. And it's not going
			to be easy to find out... the
			Prytt have consistently refused
			all outside contact and somehow I
			don't think they're going to be
			eager to start now. We'll have to
			work through the Kes.
			Contact Ambassador Mauric and tell
			him we need a meeting right away.
			Aye, sir.
			What?
			What?
			You're staring at me.
			Sorry. I was just wondering how
			long you were going to keep at
			this.
			As long as it takes. With any
			luck, there may be a structural
			flaw that would allow us to
			escape.
			Right.
			The important thing during any
			confinement is to think positively
			and not to give up hope... there
			is a way out of every box... there
			is a solution to every puzzle...
			it is simply a matter of --
			Damn.
			Well, at least this means we're
			not going to starve to death.
			What it means is that they plan on
			keeping us here for a while...
			I'm starting to think negatively,
			Jean-Luc.
			My tricorder!
			Does it work?
			Yes. But something's been added
			to the main directory.
			It's a map...
			An escape route. That guard must
			be working for the Kes...
			Possibly.
			What else could it be?
			It could be part of a very
			carefully laid trap.
			If you ask me, I'd rather take my
			chances out there.
			Agreed. Is there a way to open
			the cell door?
			Yes. The code's been entered.
			On behalf of my government, I
			would like to take this
			opportunity to present our
			profound apologizes to you
			regarding this unfortunate
			incident.
			That's very kind, Ambassador. But
			I don't think anyone here blames
			you or the Kes government for
			what's happened.
			Our primary concern is not to
			assign blame, but to recover our
			missing officers.
			Of course.
			We are prepared to insert a
			hostage rescue team into the Prytt
			capital city on three hours
			notice.
			Ambassador... we haven't even
			tried a diplomatic effort yet.
			I'd rather not use force until
			we've exhausted all other options.
			I don't believe we have any...
			diplomatic options, Commander.
			There are no formal relations with
			the Prytt...
			... no ambassadors... there's
			simply no way to contact them.
			Surely you must have some means of
			communication in case of a
			planetary emergency.
			We have never had need of such a
			system.
			We can determine their
			communications frequencies and
			establish a link.
			Allow me to be blunt.
			The Prytt are a fanatical,
			xenophobic people, with little
			regard for civilized discourse.
			Even if you do establish a
			communications link with them, it
			will be a complete waste of time.
			How long has it been since your
			last diplomatic contact?
			Almost a century.
			Then it's possible that they've
			changed over the years.
			We have had other... less formal
			contacts with the Prytt --
			contacts that I cannot discuss.
			But I can assure you, they have
			changed very little.
			Mister Ambassador... with all due
			respect, I feel I should make an
			attempt to communicate with the
			Prytt before I sanction the use of
			force.
			Of course, Commander. In the
			meantime, I will continue to make
			preparations for a rescue attempt.
			Agreed.
			I do have one request. We believe
			that the Prytt obtained their
			information about the transport of
			your captain and doctor through a
			breach in our communications
			network. If I could set up a base
			of operations here on the
			Enterprise, I would feel much more
			secure.
			Mister Worf will help you.
			Thank you.
			You first.
			Is there a problem, Ambassador?
			Probably not. I am simply
			securing the area.
			I can assure you there is no need.
			I'm sure you're right.
			This will do nicely.
			As Security Chief of the
			Enterprise, I would be glad to
			assist you in any way possible --
			There's no need. We'll take care
			of everything.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Is there a problem, Ambassador?
			Probably not. I am simply
			securing the area.
			I can assure you there is no need.
			I'm sure you're right.
			Well. This will do nicely.
			As Security Chief of the
			Enterprise, I would be glad to
			assist you in any way possible --
			There's no need. We'll take care
			of everything.
			Thank you, Lieutenant.
			Someone obviously put a lot of
			time and effort into this.
			It might have been the guard's
			personal escape route.
			You're assuming he's a Kes agent.
			Seems logical.
			There must be a lava flow or a hot
			spring somewhere near by.
			It's a lava flow... about thirty
			meters beneath us.
			We're supposed to head this way.
			I smell gas...
			This whole chamber is filled with
			pockets of a methanogenic
			compound...
			Can we get through it?
			I think so...
			What did you say?
			I didn't say anything.
			There seems to be a fairly regular
			pattern to these eruptions... if
			we're careful we should be able to
			navigate through them.
			Say when...
			Now...
			The eruptions have stopped...
			The gas is building up!
			I have scanned the entire Prytt
			communications system and I
			believe this is the primary access
			module for the central government.
			Can you determine which of these
			com links is connected to their
			prime minister's office?
			I believe so. However, the Prytt
			have no link designed for extraterritorial
			communications. Our
			hail may come as a surprise to
			them.
			Well, they're going to have to
			adjust. Open a channel.
			This is Prime Minister Horath's
			headquarters. How can I be of
			service?
			This is Commander William T.
			Riker of the Federation starship
			Enterprise. I know this is an
			unusual way to --
			The Enterprise? You mean the ship
			in orbit?
			That's right.
			Why are you on this com-link?
			Well, we didn't know how to
			contact your government directly,
			so we had to start somewhere. Now
			if I could talk with your--
			Did you get authorization for this
			communication from the Security
			Ministry?
			No. As I said, we didn't know how
			to contact you so--
			I cannot participate in an
			unauthorized communication.
			Not very friendly are they?
			No, sir.
			Sir. We are being hailed... it is
			the Prytt Security Council.
			Looks like we got somebody's
			attention. On screen.
			Enterprise, this is Security
			Minister Lorin. You will
			immediately cease all attempts at
			communication with our people.
			Minister, we've been trying to
			contact someone in your
			government. It appears that
			you've detained two of our
			officers and we would like to
			discuss this situation.
			There is nothing to discuss. If
			you do not terminate these
			transmissions, we will be forced
			to take aggressive action against
			your ship.
			Their weapon systems pose no
			threat to the Enterprise.
			Just the same, let's keep the
			shields up for the time being.
			Aye, sir.
			Is there a problem, Commander?
			Our efforts with the Prytt just
			ran into a wall.
			I am sorry. But perhaps this will
			brighten your spirits -- we have
			freed your Captain and doctor.
			What?
			They were being held in a prison
			just outside the Prytt capital.
			One of our operatives was able to
			arrange their escape.
			Where are they now?
			They should be en route to the Kes
			border. Our operative provided
			them with a detailed map and
			instructions on where to go.
			How do you plan to get them across
			the border?
			At the moment, that information is
			confidential. But trust us... we
			do have a plan.
			Ambassador... I'm afraid I must
			insist that you provide us with
			more information.
			I understand your concern, of
			course. But I would feel more...
			comfortable discussing operational
			details in a... less public
			environment.
			Certainly. We can step into the
			Ready Room.
			I would prefer... the quarters you
			provided me. They're safer.
			All right.
			There's no way out of here...
			Maybe we took a wrong turn...
			Me too...
			What?
			I'm thirsty too.
			I didn't say anything about being
			thirsty.
			I heard you. You said, "I'm very
			thirsty."
			I was thinking about it, but I
			didn't say anything.
			You were thinking it...
			The transceivers. Lorin said they
			would align themselves to our psi
			wave patterns...
			The implants might be transmitting
			our thoughts.
			What am I thinking?
			I don't know.
			I can't hear your thoughts,
			either. Maybe it was just a
			fluke.
			For now, I'm afraid we have more
			immediate concerns. Does the map
			indicate a way out of here?
			Yes. We go up.
			There's a ledge about thirty
			meters up that connects to another
			tunnel which should lead to the
			surface.
			Right.
			I heard that.
			They weren't words exactly... I
			suddenly had this... sense of
			fear... a fear of heights.
			So much for it being a fluke.
			What a strange sensation... your
			thoughts just appeared in my mind.
			If you sensed fear of heights, you
			sensed pretty accurately.
			Come on. We've done this
			before... it's just like on the
			Holodeck.
			One hand-hold at a time... nothing
			too fast... just a slow, gentle
			climb.
			Right.
			I see you've done some
			redecorating.
			Just a few pieces of equipment we
			needed for security reasons. You
			understand.
			Certainly.
			He is all right.
			Ambassador... how do you plan to
			get my people out of Prytt
			territory?
			You must realize that what I am
			about to tell you cannot leave
			this room.
			For some time now, we have had
			certain... friends among the
			Prytt. Citizens who have realized
			that the long struggle between our
			two peoples can only end when the
			Prytt government is made to see
			reason.
			You've recruited a few Prytt
			spies.
			A crude, but accurate term. These
			friends will be waiting for your
			Captain and Doctor when they reach
			the village of Ohn-Kor near the
			Kes border. The map we provided
			your officers will take them to a
			tavern there.
			Forgive me, Ambassador, but is it
			wise to send two human fugitives
			in Starfleet uniforms into a Prytt
			village?
			The danger is minimal. Our
			operatives control most of the
			town.
			Once they have made contact with
			Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher,
			our friends will escort them
			across the Kes border.
			I'd still feel better if they
			could rendezvous with your
			operatives in a less public place.
			Commander, I assure you we know
			what we're doing. We have a great
			deal of experience in dealing with
			the Prytt. And we would hardly
			risk the safety of your people...
			after all -- we're still hoping
			you'll recommend our entrance into
			the Federation.
			One of us is hungry.
			That would be me.
			Try to think of something else.
			You're making me hungry.
			What would you like me to think
			about?
			Something other than a large bowl
			of vegetable soup.
			My grandmother used to make it...
			with beans and peas and carrots --
			Beverly.
			Sorry.
			I am not being unreasonable.
			I didn't say you were. I may have
			thought it, but there's a
			difference.
			You're right. We can't react to
			every random thought that crosses
			the other person's mind.
			It's astonishing how much...
			clutter there is in our
			consciousness. Odd memories
			coming to the surface... bits of
			half-remembered songs...
			Stray day-dreams... scattered
			minutiae... I wonder how true
			telepaths sift through it all.
			How can they get to what someone's
			really thinking if their minds are
			constantly churning all this
			flotsam to the surface?
			That is not funny.
			I just wanted to see if you were
			listening.
			I think the link is getting
			stronger.
			Maybe we should put some distance
			between us... that might weaken
			it.
			Not that I'm tired of hearing your
			most intimate thoughts...
			Certainly not.
			Jean-Luc...
			What happened?
			I don't know... I suddenly felt a
			wave of nausea.
			Me too.
			I don't see anything wrong with
			either of us.
			Maybe the air is toxic...
			The same thing... but when you
			moved back toward me... I felt
			better.
			It would seem we're stuck with
			each other.
			What's wrong?
			I can't tell if we're supposed to
			go over this hill... or that one.
			The topography on this map is a
			little vague.
			Let me see.
			This way.
			You don't really know, do you?
			What?
			You're acting like you know
			exactly which way to go... but
			you're just guessing. Do you do
			this all the time?
			No.
			But... there are times when it's
			important for a Captain to give
			the appearance of confidence.
			I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I
			couldn't resist...
			I'm beginning to realize that you
			seem to always have some...
			acerbic remark on the tip of your
			tongue.
			At least I've trained myself not
			to say it anymore. When I was a
			little girl, my mouth was always
			landing me in trouble with my
			parents... my teachers...
			Your friends... and someone named
			Tom Norris... ?
			That's right. We had one date...
			which I brought to an abrupt halt
			with the words... "Is that a beard
			or is your face dirty?"
			"Or is your face dirty?"
			There's something more... you're
			laughing, but...
			You actually feel... embarrassed
			about that incident.
			Yes.
			I thought I was being cute... but
			I really hurt him.
			That was a long time ago. And it
			taught me a valuable lesson.
			This... sharing of thoughts and
			feelings... it's compelling in a
			strange way...
			Very.
			We'd better get going.
			I don't think so, either. Maybe
			there's another way to reach the
			village.
			No. We'd have to backtrack
			several kilometers to find another
			way over this ridge.
			The border's only two kilometers
			east of here... there's a
			forcefield protecting it, but
			we'll have to find a way to deal
			with that when we get there.
			All right.
			Is something wrong?
			Have a seat.
			Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher
			did not show up at the designated
			rendezvous point.
			Do you know what happened to them?
			No. We have no idea what happened
			to them.
			We find it strange that your
			officers would follow the escape
			plan so precisely -- but then fail
			to make a crucial rendezvous with
			our operatives.
			It is possible they have been
			recaptured.
			Our sources would have informed us
			instantly if that had happened.
			But of course, if they weren't
			captured... if they simply... made
			a different rendezvous... we might
			not ever know about it.
			A different rendezvous? I'm not
			sure what you mean.
			Of course you're not. You
			wouldn't know if your Captain and
			Doctor were meeting secretly with
			the Prytt.
			Meeting in order to set up a
			military alliance with the
			Federation...
			What?
			It was a clever scheme... first
			you pretend to "lose" your
			officers during transport... then
			you ask us for help... and get us
			to expose several of our
			undercover operatives in the
			process. But what you didn't
			expect was for us to get your
			people out of prison so quickly.
			They needed more time... more time
			to plot the destruction of the Kes
			with their new Prytt friends.
			This is ridiculous. You're
			starting to see conspiracies
			everywhere. We were invited here
			by the Kes, why would we want to
			ally ourselves with the Prytt?
			Why indeed?
			You can believe what you want...
			we're going to find our people
			with or without your help.
			Then I believe it's time for us to
			be leaving the Enterprise.
			Just make sure you take all that
			junk with you.
			No luck.
			I'm beginning to think there's not
			a single thing on this planet we
			can eat.
			Well... if we're lucky, we'll be
			back on the Enterprise by this
			time tomorrow and you can plant
			yourself in front of a replicator
			with a knife and fork.
			Remember that Vulcan dish I
			promised you for breakfast? I was
			just thinking...
			You hate having breakfast with me.
			That's not true.
			Yes, it is. As soon as I said,
			"breakfast" I heard you say, "I
			hate that."
			That's not quite what I meant...
			Well, what did you mean?
			I simply... don't like...
			... don't like what I've been
			choosing for breakfast.
			No, no. It's... just that I feel
			breakfast should be... a simple
			meal... and recently they seem to
			have become more elaborate.
			Tea and scones. That's all you
			really want, isn't it? Tea and
			scones. Why didn't you say so?
			It didn't seem that important...
			You don't like those elaborate
			meals either.
			I usually prefer something simple
			myself... but somehow I thought
			you might enjoy more variety.
			Well, it's tea and scones for both
			of us from now on.
			I love firelight.
			I love firelight.
			There's something about the
			flame... the smell of the
			smoke... I've always felt it's
			intoxicating in a way...
			I remember when Jack and I took
			Wesley on his first camping trip
			to Balfour Lake. Wesley kept
			throwing manta leaves in the fire
			to watch them pop... Jack kept
			telling him...
			What?
			Jean-Luc... I heard you. Don't
			push it away.
			Beverly, please. I don't want to
			talk about this right now.
			When I said, "Jack and I"... I
			could feel this sudden wave of...
			something.
			I never knew you felt that way.
			Didn't you?
			I guess I always knew there was...
			an attraction between us, right
			from the start. But I had no idea
			how strongly you felt...
			Why didn't you ever tell me you
			were in love with me?
			You were married to my best
			friend.
			At first, it seemed like a
			harmless infatuation... something
			more hormonal than emotional. But
			then...
			But then as the months went by...
			and the three of us starting
			spending more time together...
			I began to realize that it was
			something more.
			It wasn't right... and I knew I
			wouldn't act on it... but I
			couldn't help the way I felt.
			And when Jack died... you felt
			guilty.
			I felt guilty before he died...
			having those kind of feelings for
			my best friend's wife. Then...
			later, after the accident... I
			told myself that no matter what
			happened I would never let you
			know how I felt.
			You didn't want to feel as if you
			were...
			Betraying my friend...
			That's why you didn't want me on
			the Enterprise seven years ago.
			I didn't know how I would react.
			But gradually, I found that I
			didn't feel that way anymore...
			that twenty years was indeed a
			long time...
			And now we're friends...
			Yes... friends.
			We still have a lot of ground to
			cover tomorrow. We should get
			some sleep.
			Right.
			Ambassador. Thank you for coming.
			Commander.
			We're about to clear up this
			misunderstanding once and for all.
			Hail Minister Lorin, please.
			Aye, sir.
			Enterprise, I have warned you
			about these unauthorized
			communications...
			Yes, I know. But I think it's
			about time we all sat down
			together and tried to work this
			out. I have Ambassador Mauric
			here and --
			That is your misfortune. We have
			nothing to say to either of you.
			Commander... I know you're working
			with the Prytt. Putting on a
			little show like that for my
			benefit does neither of us any
			good.
			We'll see.
			Mister Worf...
			I think there's someone waiting
			for us in the Observation Lounge.
			I should have known that anyone
			willing to deal with the Kes would
			be capable of such an outrage.
			I'm sorry I had to resort to these
			drastic measures, Minister, but
			you left me little choice.
			Don't pretend that the two of you
			are enemies. It is too late for
			a charade.
			If that is an attempt to hide your
			military alliance with the
			Federation, you needn't bother.
			I already know far more than you
			can imagine.
			Let's all just sit down and try to
			talk about what's happened to
			Captain Picard and Doctor Crusher.
			I will not sit at a table with...
			him.
			No more than I would sit with her.
			All right... then we'll stand.
			The important thing is that we
			start talking.
			I am not authorized to talk with
			a Kes official.
			Then talk to me. Where are my
			officers?
			As if you don't already know.
			I'm all right.
			We are already aware of your plan
			to use Federation technology to
			build new attack satellites. You
			will find that we are prepared for
			them.
			An interesting, if pointless lie.
			I would rather discuss your own
			plans to use Federation aid to
			stage a takeover of Kolrod Island.
			We have been over this before.
			Kolrod clearly belongs to the
			Prytt who originally--
			That's it.
			I can see that... diplomacy is not
			going to get us anywhere today,
			and I don't have time for an
			extended negotiation session. So
			it's time to lay all the cards on
			the table.
			That means it's time to stop
			fooling around and get serious.
			You're concerned that the Kes are
			about to be admitted into an
			associative membership with the
			Federation.
			Correct.
			As First Officer of the Enterprise
			I think I can promise you that is
			not going to happen. The Kes will
			be denied membership.
			You do not have the authority to
			do that. Despite whatever games
			you may have played with the Prytt
			since your arrival, we still plan
			on taking our petition directly to
			the Federation Council. They will
			listen to our--
			They will listen to the report of
			the Enterprise Captain and his
			First Officer. And I can tell you
			right now that the First Officer's
			report will go something like
			this:
			"Kesprytt is a deeply troubled
			world with social, political, and
			military problems that it has yet
			to resolve. The Kes, although a
			friendly and democratic people,
			are driven by suspicion,
			deviousness, and paranoia. In the
			opinion of this officer, they are
			not ready for membership."
			Now to the matter of our missing
			officers...
			They are still charged with
			spying, Commander. I have heard
			nothing here which would alter
			that.
			Then maybe you should consider
			this: If anything happens to them,
			Starfleet is going to want a full
			investigation. That means more
			starships will be sent to
			Kesprytt... and those ships are
			going to want answers... which
			means they'll be putting your
			country under a very large and
			very uncomfortable microscope.
			Remember how unhappy you were when
			we contacted just one of your
			people without authorization?
			Well, think of what it'll be like
			when ten starships start looking
			for answers. They'll be
			contacting hundreds of your
			people... they'll conduct massive
			sensor sweeps... they might even
			start sending down Away Teams.
			And all because you wouldn't help
			me find my missing officers...
			I think I can use the tricorder to
			set-up a multiphase pulse. That
			should weaken the field enough for
			us to get through.
			No, no. The modulation frequency
			should be in the upper-harmonic
			range.
			Right.
			I'm going as fast as I can.
			Minister, we have the human
			female. The male is standing in
			Kes territory.
			Very well. Transmit their
			coordinates to the Enterprise
			Transporter Room.
			Understood.
			Thank you, Minister. Now, if
			you'll excuse me...
			Mauric is determined to take his
			protest to the Federation Council,
			but I don't think he'll get very
			far.
			I tend to agree, Number One.
			Did I miss something?
			I know... I know... you're
			absolutely right.
			That was wonderful.
			My pleasure.
			Don't take this the wrong way,
			Jean-Luc... but I'm glad we're not
			joined at the hip anymore.
			Were you getting tired of my
			company?
			Just tired of bumping into you
			every thirty seconds. I was
			beginning to feel like you were
			part of my uniform.
			Champagne... ?
			What shall we drink to?
			Our... freedom.
			Freedom.
			Penny for your thoughts.
			I was just thinking... that as
			distracting as it was... I was
			beginning to get used to...
			"hearing" your thoughts.
			So was I. It was very...
			intimate.
			You know... last night... I woke
			up...
			Oh?
			I was awake for several hours.
			And thanks to the implant, I got
			to "hear" some very interesting
			dreams of yours.
			A man can't be held responsible
			for what his mind does when he's
			asleep.
			What about when he's awake?
			So now that we've had this...
			unique experience... what do we do
			now?
			What do you mean?
			You know exactly what I mean.
			No I don't. The implant's been
			removed, remember?
			I mean now that we know how we
			each feel... perhaps we shouldn't
			be afraid to explore those
			feelings...
			I'm not afraid... but I'm also not
			ready.
			Good-night.
			Good-night.
