			Data, there you are... we need to
			install that plasma conduit right
			away. We're bringing the new warp
			core on-line in less than three
			hours.
			I will go to deck twenty and begin
			modifications.
			Great. Meet me in Engineering as
			soon as you're finished.
			This should be a lot of fun.
			Excuse me. Do you have
			authorization to work in this
			area?
			You are dismantling a warp plasma
			conduit. I must ask you to stop.
			Be quiet!
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47225.7.
			Commander La Forge has completed
			the installation of our new warp
			core. We are preparing to test
			its capabilities.
			Something wrong, sir?
			I just got a message from
			Starfleet command.
			Bad news?
			You could say that...
			I've been invited to the annual
			Starfleet Admiral's banquet.
			My condolences.
			I've managed to avoid it for the
			last six years. I guess my luck
			just ran out...
			I can't imagine anything more
			tedious. Fifty Admirals shaking
			hands, making dull conversation...
			uninteresting food... boring
			speeches...
			Can't you find an excuse not to
			go?
			After six years, I don't have any
			excuses left. Besides, I've been
			invited by Admiral Nakamura, the
			Sector Commander. He'd consider
			it an insult if I turned him down.
			We could cause a diplomatic
			crisis. Take the ship into the
			neutral zone and attack the
			Romulans... that should get you
			out of the banquet.
			I wouldn't count on it.
			Have you ever had nightmares
			before?
			Sure. Everybody does from time to
			time...
			I have had one hundred eleven
			dreams since I first discovered
			the program nine months ago. In
			all of that time, I have never
			experienced such strange and
			disturbing imagery in a dream.
			I believe it was... a nightmare.
			Nightmares are part of dreaming,
			Data. Maybe you just discovered
			a new level to your program.
			Perhaps. I have also noted that
			I am spending an inordinate amount
			of time thinking about nightmare
			imagery. One could almost say
			that I am... preoccupied.
			Well, that's perfectly normal.
			When I have a nightmare, sometimes
			I can't shake that weird feeling
			for days...
			Commander La Forge!
			Speaking of nightmares...
			I just finished recalibrating the
			starboard EPS module.
			That's great. Thank you, Ensign.
			It's just like you said -- reset
			the power tap... and the module
			came right on-line. You have such
			a wonderful grasp of engineering
			principles. I'm learning so much
			just by being around you...
			Well. Ah... why don't you go help
			Farrel check the deuterium
			cartridges. We're about to bring
			the warp core on-line.
			Anything you say.
			Geordi, you do not seem to
			appreciate Ensign Tyler's
			enthusiasm.
			Oh, she's enthusiastic all
			right... about me.
			I do not understand.
			She has a crush on me, Data.
			And you do not share her
			affection?
			Frankly, no. And it's getting a
			little awkward...
			I believe I understand. You are
			concerned about unintentionally
			hurting Ensign Tyler's feelings.
			Yeah... something like that...
			It would appear that you require
			a third party to intervene on your
			behalf. I would be happy to speak
			to her.
			No, Data... I'll take care of it
			myself. Thanks.
			When I first woke up from my
			nightmare, there --
			Bridge to Commander La Forge.
			What's our status?
			We're ready to bring the core on-line,
			Captain. Stand by.
			All right. Let's do it.
			Initializing deuterium infusion
			sequence...
			It's a beauty, isn't it? Now
			let's see how fast she can run...
			La Forge to Bridge. Warp power at
			your discretion, Captain.
			Acknowledged.
			Ensign Russell, plot a course to
			Starbase Two-nineteen. Warp six.
			Engage.
			Engage...
			Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
			Forge... why isn't my ship moving?
			I'm on it, sir. There's a warp
			plasma conduit out of alignment,
			but I think I've fixed it...
			Ready, sir.
			Very well. Ensign Russell?
			Mister La Forge?
			Stand by, Captain...
			I will take the warp engines off-line.
			La Forge to Bridge. I'm sorry,
			Captain. We're going to have to
			reconfigure the plasma conduit.
			It's going to take a few hours at
			least, sir.
			Enter.
			Hello, Data...
			What are you doing?
			I am watching Spot sleep. In the
			past fifteen minutes, he has had
			twelve muscles spasms, which
			indicates that he is dreaming.
			I have often wondered what he
			dreams about. His twitching and
			his rapid breathing would seem to
			suggest anxiety -- but Spot has
			never seen a mouse or any other
			form of rodentia. Nor has he
			encountered an insect, or been
			chased by a canine.
			I understand you've had some
			interesting dreams lately...
			Geordi was a little worried about
			you. He just wanted me to check
			in and see how you were doing...
			That was very thoughtful of him.
			I have been debating whether or
			not to initiate another dream
			sequence.
			Because of the nightmares... ?
			I have found them to be quite...
			unsettling.
			Data, you shouldn't be afraid to
			experience dark imagery in your
			dreams. It's a natural expression
			of your unconscious...
			... if you have an unconscious.
			I'm not really sure how your
			positronic brain works... but if
			it's anything like our brains,
			then there's part of you that's
			trying to express itself through
			your dream state. And I think you
			should allow yourself to
			experience it.
			As Sigmund Freud would have
			said... "Dreams are the royal
			road to the knowledge of the
			mind."
			Thank you, Counselor. I believe
			I will initialize the dream
			program now.
			Let me know how it goes. Good
			night, Data.
			Good night, Counselor.
			Good night, Spot.
			Computer -- dim lights.
			Mmm. It is delicious.
			What kind of cake are you eating?
			It is cellular peptide cake...
			with mint frosting. Would you
			like a bite?
			No, thank you.
			Excuse me, Mister Worf.
			Aren't you going to answer that,
			Mister Data?
			Sir?
			That damn ringing. Answer it,
			will you?
			Yes sir.
			Please identify yourselves.
			I must know what you are trying to --
			Be quiet!
			Counselor...
			Data, please... don't hurt me..
			I am sorry, Counselor.
			No...
			Data, no! DATA!
			Data!
			What is wrong?
			We've been trying to wake you up
			for the past five minutes.
			When you didn't show up in
			Engineering on time, I got
			worried... I called security...
			My internal chronometer was
			supposed to wake me thirty-five
			minutes ago.
			You must have... overslept.
			That is not possible...
			Something is wrong.
			I can't find anything wrong with
			your internal time-base... and as
			far as I can tell, your primary
			systems check out fine.
			My chronometer is functioning
			normally, as well.
			I will compare my autonomic logs
			to the ship's chronometer.
			Perhaps we overlooked something.
			You know, Data... there's a lot we
			don't know about your dream
			program. Maybe it was designed to
			cause some side-effects...
			For all we know, Doctor Soong
			intended for you to oversleep now
			and then... as part of the human
			experience.
			It is a possibility. However, I
			would prefer to make certain there
			are no anomalies in my neural net.
			I'm curious... what were you
			dreaming about when we woke you
			up?
			I have not fully assimilated its
			impact. I would prefer to study
			the images further before
			discussing them.
			Sure... I understand.
			Sounds like it must've been pretty
			strange...
			"Strange" is not a sufficient
			adjective to describe the
			experience.
			Tell me more about this... "cake."
			It is difficult to explain.
			Counselor Troi's body was -- a
			cake.
			Her upper-body...
			Describe the knife you used to...
			"cut" the Counselor.
			It had a black handle and a
			serrated blade. And it was quite
			long.
			How long?
			Approximately twenty-five
			centimeters in length.
			What happened next?
			One of the workmen pointed to her
			right shoulder. At that moment,
			I felt an overwhelming urge to cut
			a piece out of the cake.
			And did you... ?
			Yes. As I began to slice the
			cake, she reacted as though I was
			causing her pain. And yet, I
			could not stop cutting.
			It was then that I woke up.
			Mmm...
			I am curious, Doctor Freud... what
			do my nightmares mean?
			I believe you are experiencing a
			classic dismemberment dream.
			Or in your case... being a
			mechanical man... a dismantlement
			dream.
			I do not understand.
			Your mechanistic qualities are
			trying to reassert themselves over
			your human tendencies. Ego and id
			are struggling for domination.
			The "workmen" symbolize the ever-present
			id constantly working to
			destroy the ego.
			The image of Counselor Troi, a
			female, is devoured by you...
			clearly indicating an unconscious
			desire to possess your own mother.
			But I do not have a mother.
			Do not interrupt. The knife and
			its violent connotation suggests
			a certain feeling of sexual
			inadequacy...
			I have no sexual desires.
			Ach! Repression on top of
			everything. It is all becoming
			clear to me now...
			There might be a paper in this...
			I could call it "Mister D: An
			Analysis of Android Dementia."
			I do not believe I am being helped
			by this session.
			Classic transference! Your anger
			toward me is, in fact, the
			animosity you feel toward your
			father.
			You are a polymorphously-perverse
			individual, Mister Data, and I
			recommend full psychoanalysis.
			I believe I can fit you in... next
			Tuesday.
			That will not be necessary.
			Computer -- end program.
			Captain. Incoming message from
			Admiral Nakamura.
			On screen.
			Admiral.
			Captain, we were expecting you
			this morning. Is there a problem?
			Actually, we've been experiencing
			a few minor difficulties with our
			new warp core. But my Chief
			Engineer assures me that we'll be
			under way within the hour.
			I was hoping we'd have a chance to
			discuss your new mission orders
			before the banquet... but I guess
			it'll have to wait.
			My apologies, Admiral.
			You're not trying to... avoid this
			particular engagement, are you,
			Captain?
			Oh, no... certainly not, sir. I'm
			looking forward to it.
			Good. I'll expect you soon.
			Nakamura out.
			I think he's on to you, sir.
			La Forge to Bridge.
			Go ahead, Geordi.
			We've just started her up, sir.
			All systems are holding steady...
			Ready when you are, Captain.
			Ensign Russell -- set course and
			engage.
			Engineering -- report!
			The warp field has collapsed, sir.
			It looks like we've blown out the
			entire power converter, Captain.
			Impulse engines are down, too --
			we're not going anywhere...
			But I know exactly how to fix it.
			Give me two, three hours, tops.
			Now what?
			Talk about going nowhere fast.
			Mister Worf, open a channel to
			Starbase Two-nineteen. Advise
			Admiral Nakamura... I'll be later
			than I thought.
			Tyler, how are you coming with
			that relay diagnostic?
			Almost done, sir...
			If you'll excuse me, I need this
			plasma inverter...
			Ensign Tyler still appears to have
			a "crush" on you, Geordi. It is
			clear that you did not speak with
			her.
			I haven't had a chance, Data...
			Here. Give me a hand with this
			coil brace.
			Could you perform a metallurgical
			scan on the brace... see if there
			are any microfractures? Be
			careful, it's kind of sharp.
			Is there a problem, Data?
			I am reminded of a recent dream.
			This brace is reminiscent of...
			Aren't you going to answer that,
			Commander?
			What are you waiting for? Answer
			it!
			Hello?
			Kill them. You must kill them
			all... before it's too late.
			Data.
			Data, what's wrong?
			I do not know.
			Everything seems to remind me of
			the nightmare -- objects, sounds,
			smells. And now I have seen
			elements from the dream while
			still in a waking state.
			I cannot explain it.
			Data... if you were one of my
			human patients, I might be
			concerned right now. I'd say you
			had a waking dream... or a
			hallucination...
			But you're not human. It seems to
			me that we might be looking at
			some sort of technological
			problem...
			I have run three complete self-diagnostics.
			All of my systems
			are functioning normally.
			I have studied over one hundred
			thirty-eight different theories of
			dream analysis in an effort to
			explain my nightmares.
			What have you found?
			I have been unable to find a
			single interpretation of my
			nightmares. For instance, Neo-Platonic
			hermetic texts from the
			Ancient Near East would suggest
			that my experience indicates a
			prophetic function -- that I have
			perceived an impending disaster.
			Professor Syrus of Tilonus Four
			would consider my dreams nothing
			more than epi-phenomena in my
			neural net. Random discharges
			with no meaning whatsoever.
			Doctor Freud of early Twentieth
			century Earth suggested that my
			dreams represent a latent psychosexual
			complex.
			Perhaps Freud was correct... and
			the knife I dreamed of is the
			embodiment of my unconscious
			desire to inflict violence.
			Data... even Freud said "sometimes
			a cigar is just a cigar."
			A lot of the theories you've
			examined are interesting... but
			they're also flawed and obsolete.
			That knife could just as well be
			an archetypal symbol of rational
			clarity -- it's sharp... it cuts
			through things that are dull...
			The bottom line is... I think you
			may be developing an almost...
			obsessive interest in your own
			inner-workings.
			I'd almost call it the beginnings
			of a... neurosis.
			That is not possible.
			Why not? You've eliminated all
			the technical explanations. And
			it makes sense that as your neural
			net becomes more complex... more
			human... you might experience the
			same kind of psychological
			complexities as a human.
			Do you really think it is
			possible?
			You may be the first person who's
			come into my office who's actually
			been excited by the prospect of a
			new neurosis.
			But yes... I do think it's
			possible. In fact, I'd like to
			start counseling you on a regular
			basis.
			Daily?
			No... we'll start weekly. And as
			a first step, I want you to shut
			down your dream program until our
			next session... just to be safe.
			Give yourself a chance to reflect
			on this experience.
			Thank you, Counselor. I look
			forward to our next meeting.
			And Data...
			Next time... see me before you see
			Sigmund.
			Admiral, I can explain...
			Let me guess. Your new warp core
			is... "malfunctioning" again?
			Unfortunately, the problem has
			affected our impulse systems now.
			At the moment, we are... adrift.
			Are you expecting to have the
			problem fixed soon... or shall we
			send out a tow ship to bring you
			in?
			That won't be necessary. I have
			full confidence in my Engineering
			staff. I will be at the banquet
			on time.
			Incidentally, Captain... the
			banquet really won't be as bad as
			you might expect.
			The key note speaker is going to
			address Bajoran aqueduct
			management. And I hear they're
			serving Ktarian spice cake for
			dessert this year.
			Yes, I know... it sounds...
			delightful.
			It is not to be missed.
			Understood?
			Yes, sir. Picard out.

			Yes, sir. Picard out.
			Have you tried reconfiguring the
			plasma conduit?
			Yes, sir... we did that two hours
			ago.
			What about the relays? Have you
			made absolutely sure they don't
			need a new phase invertor?
			I am currently running a level
			three diagnostic on the relays,
			sir. We will have the results of
			the analysis in approximately ten
			minutes.
			I see...
			Perhaps I can help you reconfigure
			these isolinear chips...
			No, sir, please don't touch that --
			Sir... Commander Data and I have
			the situation under control. If
			you'd just let the two of us take
			care of it... we can get the work
			done a lot faster...
			You're right...
			If you don't mind, I'll just wait
			here and observe your progress.
			Actually, Captain...
			Captain. We could use an extra
			hand moving the containment
			pods...
			Not at all. I'd be happy to...
			Good work, Ensign. I thought he'd
			never leave...
			Data, would you help me lock down
			this plasma conduit... ?
			Data?
			Data... ?
			Deck Thirty-six.
			Hello, Data.
			Data... are you all right?
			What are you doing?
			I am sorry, Counselor.
			NO!
			Ever since you gave Alexander that
			music program... he has been
			playing it all night... every
			night.
			I was just trying to broaden his
			horizons. Besides, he likes it.
			It is screeching... pounding...
			dissonant. It is not music.
			Worf, it's better than music --
			it's jazz.
			Data -- !
			Medical emergency, deck seventeen,
			section three alpha!
			I believe I had another waking
			dream, sir. But this time, I felt
			an uncontrollable urge to...
			eliminate the image I saw.
			And what you saw was some sort of
			a... "mouth" on Counselor Troi's
			shoulder...
			Yes, sir. And for a reason I
			cannot explain, I felt the need to
			destroy it.
			What about me? Did you see one of
			these mouths on my head?
			No, sir. I saw a straw coming out
			of your head.
			A straw?
			As I said, these are all images
			that I originally experienced in
			my dream program. I do not have
			a rational explanation for them.
			But you said you shut down your
			dream program...
			That is correct.
			Mister La Forge?
			We've run every possible
			diagnostic on Data's positronic
			net... but we can't find anything
			wrong. I can run a sub-polymer
			scan... but it'll take some time
			to get the equipment together.
			Make it so.
			In the meantime, Mister Data...
			I'm going to have to relieve you
			of duty and confine you to
			quarters.
			A sensible precaution, sir.
			It's all right, Deanna... you're
			in Sickbay. Everything's going to
			be all right.
			Data...
			He's not here... try to relax.
			The vascular pad has healed your
			wound. But you've lost a lot of
			blood... so I want you to lie
			still for a while.
			That's odd... there shouldn't be
			any discoloration after the
			treatment. This looks like some
			sort of rash...
			What is it?
			I'm picking up cellular
			degradation. But I don't think
			it's related to the lacerations...
			And there's some kind of residual
			interphasic signature...
			Nurse, get me an interphasic
			scanner... I want to take a
			closer look.
			Does that hurt?
			Not at all...
			I will have to confiscate your
			sidearm.
			May I ask a personal favor?
			Yes?
			Will you take care of Spot for me?
			Your... animal?
			I am concerned that if I have
			another waking dream, I may...
			injure him.
			Of course.
			Spot. Come here.
			Unlike a canine, Spot will not
			respond to verbal commands.
			Goodbye, Spot.
			He will need to be fed once a day.
			He prefers feline supplement one-twenty-five.
			I understand.
			And he will require water. And
			you must also provide him with a
			sand box.
			And you must talk to him. Tell
			him he is a pretty cat, and a good
			cat...
			I will... feed him.
			Perhaps that will be enough.
			Captain. We have a problem. Take
			a look at this...
			Her tissue is breaking down on a
			cellular level... and it's
			spreading. At first I thought it
			was a rash from the coil brace she
			was stabbed with... but when I
			used the interphasic scanner, I
			found something else...
			What is it?
			The better question is... what are
			they?
			I've only checked the medical
			staff... but I've found them on
			almost everyone so far...
			The infestation rate has reached
			seventy-three percent of the crew
			so far. The cellular decay is
			accelerating in all cases. I
			haven't found a way to stop it...
			or even slow it down.
			What are we dealing with here?
			Are these creatures... feeding off
			us?
			In a way... They appear to be
			extracting our cellular peptides.
			It's roughly analogous to the way
			Terran leeches consume hemoglobin.
			Can we reverse the process?
			Not until the organisms are
			removed. And if they're not
			removed soon, our bodies will
			begin to lose all cellular
			cohesion... we'll collapse into
			nothing but a few pounds of
			chemicals.
			Can we affect the organisms in any
			way?
			We've tried E-M radiation...
			subspace fields... thermal
			protons... nothing works. They
			seem to exist in an interphasic
			state, just beyond our visual and
			sensor acuity. The only way we
			can see them is to use an IP
			scanner... tricorders can't even
			pick them up.
			Do we know where these things came
			from?
			I have scanned the vicinity with
			an IP scanner. There is no sign
			of any similar creatures, or any
			unusual interphasic activity.
			Perhaps Starbase Eighty-four...
			could we have picked them up there
			during the installation of the
			warp core?
			I contacted the Starbase and had
			them use IP scanners. Nothing.
			What about Mister Data? There
			must be some connection between
			his odd behavior and these
			creatures. Is he infested, as
			well?
			No. I scanned him, but I didn't
			find anything.
			Data attacked Counselor Troi
			because he said he saw a...
			"mouth" on her shoulder...
			And in that same area, you first
			discovered one of the organisms...
			He also saw a "straw" on the side
			of my head... and Beverly found an
			organism in the same spot.
			Those were all images from his
			dreams... maybe he's unconsciously
			perceiving these creatures...
			I think it's time we took a closer
			look at Mister Data's dreams.
			It is an interesting hypothesis.
			If I am being affected by these
			interphasic creatures on an
			unconscious level, it may also
			explain my waking dreams, and my
			subsequent anti-social behavior.
			What we want to do is link your
			neural net into the Holodeck...
			and have you activate your dream
			program, so as you're dreaming...
			we can observe the dream images.
			Perhaps we can learn more about
			the creatures by interpreting the
			symbols and images in your dreams.
			I see. The concept is similar to
			the method of Directed Dreaming.
			Exactly.
			How soon can you have the link
			ready?
			We'd need about an hour to
			establish all the interface
			parameters.
			Make it so.
			In the meantime, Mister Data...
			I'd say you should prepare for
			bed.
			I think we're ready, Captain...
			the link is active, and the
			Holodeck has been calibrated to
			Data's neural net.
			Ready, Mister Data?
			Yes, sir.
			Normally, I would wish you
			pleasant dreams... but in this
			case, bad dreams would be more
			helpful.
			I understand.
			I am initializing my dream
			program. Stand by...
			Keep your eyes peeled. Even an
			apparently insignificant image
			could be an important symbol.
			Right...
			Hello.
			Can we talk to Data directly... or
			will that wake him up?
			He should be perceiving us as just
			another part of his dream.
			Anything we say to him will be
			taken in that context...
			That sounds like a telephone
			ringer...
			I don't see a receiver...
			Cake?
			Thank you.
			Look at that... her right
			shoulder... the same place he
			stabbed her...
			Wait a minute... in his waking
			dream, he said there was a mouth
			on her shoulder...
			They're both symbols of...
			consumption. Food... a mouth...
			Mister Data, what kind of cake is
			this?
			It is cellular peptide cake.
			With mint frosting.
			Cellular peptides... that's
			exactly what the creatures are
			extracting.
			Will someone answer that damn
			ringing!
			Captain -- the ringing is getting
			worse.
			What could the ringing symbolize?
			Sound... a bell... an old way of
			communicating...
			Want some? It's delicious.
			Will somebody please get that!
			Yes... ?
			It's for you.
			Picard.
			Kill them.
			Kill who?
			Kill them... before it is too
			late.
			Who is this?
			I am Doctor Sigmund Freud.
			How does he fit into all this?
			If I were to interpret my own
			appearance in this dream, I would
			say I am the symbolic
			representation of Data's
			unconscious mind trying to warn
			him about the dangers he perceives
			around him.
			You mean, the interphasic
			organisms...
			Of course.
			Tell me, Doctor... how can we kill
			them?
			Answer it.
			Nien, nien, nien. Do not be so
			literal. When I say answer it, I
			mean respond to it... to them.
			Be quiet!
			What do they represent?
			I don't know... but I recognize
			that junction they're working on.
			It's the plasma conduit we
			installed with the new warp
			core...
			"Respond"... respond to them...
			what does that mean?
			What is it you're doing?
			Go away. Leave us alone.
			Who are you?
			We are... your enemies.
			Stop. You are hurting my friends
			and I must --
			Be quiet!
			Data, the shrieking noise you made --
			it causes them pain!
			Be... quiet!
			I believe I understand.
			Geordi, you must adjust my
			positronic subprocessor to emit an
			interphasic pulse.
			Data, what's going on?
			The workmen in my dreams represent
			the organisms which are trying to
			demolish the ship. The incessant
			ringing of the telephone, and
			Freud's cautions at the other end,
			were warnings of the dangers
			around us.
			What about the shrieking noise you
			made?
			My positronic subprocessors were
			detecting high-frequency
			interphasic signatures from the
			organisms... which were
			symbolically represented in my
			dreams by the high shriek.
			When you made those sounds, the
			workmen reacted in pain...
			That is why I have asked Geordi to

			Ready...
			Picard to Sickbay. Beverly, we're
			going to be sweeping the ship with
			a high-frequency IP pulse.
			Monitor the creatures for any
			response.
			Understood.
			It's working, Captain...
			Captain's Log, supplemental The
			creatures infesting the Enterprise
			have been completely eliminated.
			We believe the infestation
			originated within the warp core we
			obtained on Starbase Eighty-four.
			This conduit was manufactured on
			Thanatos Seven using a new
			interphasic fusion process. We
			think that process must've
			attracted the organisms to the
			conduit... where they lay
			dormant... until we activated the
			warp core.
			That's also why we couldn't get
			the warp core on-line. The
			creatures were disrupting the
			plasma flow.
			How long until we have warp power
			again?
			We'll have to manufacture a new
			conduit. I'd say another six
			hours.
			The banquet is in eight hours...
			Take your time. Give yourself
			another twelve hours, if you need
			it.
			Understood, sir.
			Ensign Tyler.
			Yes, Commander?
			There's something I've been
			meaning to tell you...
			Sir?
			Thanks. You've been doing a great
			job. We've got to work on toning
			down your enthusiasm a little...
			but I think you're going to fit in
			just fine.
			Thank you, sir.
			Enter.
			Counselor, I did not get a chance
			to apologize for my behavior...
			Data, don't worry about it.
			Geordi explained everything. It
			wasn't your fault.
			But somehow I felt turnabout would
			be fair play... so I made us a
			little something to snack on...
			I wonder... what would Freud say
			about the symbolism of devouring
			oneself?
			Data... sometimes a cake is just
			a cake.
