			Report.
			There's an object of some kind
			closing in on our position.
			On screen.
			It appears to be an unmanned probe --
			approximately half a meter in
			diameter. It has no identifiable
			armaments.
			We are being hailed...
			You are being hailed, sir -- by
			name.
			Open a channel.
			This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of
			the --
			I am reading a power surge --
			Shields up.
			The beam appears to contain
			holographic imaging information...
			It's trying to project
			something...
			Isolate the bandwidth and let the
			signal through the shields.
			Bok...
			I trust you remember me, Picard,
			because I haven't forgotten you...
			or how you murdered my son...
			For fifteen years I've thought
			about how to avenge his death...
			but nothing I could do to you
			could equal what you did to me...
			until now.
			You thought you could hide him
			from me, didn't you? But I found
			out about him... Jason Vigo is as
			good as dead.
			I'm going to kill your son,
			Picard, just like you killed
			mine...
			Put a tractor beam on that probe
			and determine if it's safe to beam
			it aboard. I want to know where
			it came from.
			Mister Data, see if there's any
			mention of a Jason Vigo in
			Federation records.
			You might start with Miranda Vigo --
			she was born on New Gaul about
			forty years ago...
			Yes, sir.
			Contact the Ferengi Government and
			find out what you can about Bok.
			He was wearing a Daimon's uniform --
			if he's regained his rank, I want
			to know why.
			Come.
			The Ferengi Government is debating
			an amendment to the Rules of
			Acquisition...
			-- it might be a while before they
			get back to us...
			Data found out that the woman you
			mentioned does have a son named
			Jason.
			This is the most recent picture we
			could find.
			How old is the boy now?
			Twenty three.
			He and his mother left Earth about
			six years ago and settled on Camor
			Five. That's all we know, the
			planet's records are practically
			non-existent.
			Picard to Bridge. Set course for
			the Camor system, warp five.
			Aye, sir.
			Wil... I appreciate your not
			asking, but you have the right to
			know...
			There is a possibility that the
			boy is my son... I was involved
			with his mother for a short time
			about twenty four years ago. I
			met her through a friend during
			shore-leave on Earth. It was all
			very romantic...
			-- probably because we both knew
			I'd be leaving in two weeks... we
			kept in touch for a short while,
			but we never managed to get
			together again...
			And she never said anything about
			being pregnant... ?
			No... either Bok's got it wrong
			and I'm not the father, or Miranda
			decided she wanted to raise the
			child on her own. Quite frankly
			it wouldn't surprise me. She was
			very independent... very strong-willed...
			You'd have to be to get by on
			Camor Five.
			Whether he's really my son or not,
			the fact is he's in danger. Bok
			tried to kill me six years ago...
			I have no doubt he intends to make
			good on his threat against the
			boy...
			Anything?
			There are no Ferengi vessels
			within range of our scanners...
			Captain, I have been unable to
			find any information about Jason
			Vigo's current whereabouts...
			What about his mother's?
			No, sir.
			Miranda was trained as a
			botanist... she used to talk
			about running a farm some day. We
			might start with the agricultural
			areas.
			That would significantly narrow
			our search; the only cultivated
			land is on the southern continent,
			and there are relatively few
			people engaged in agricultural
			activities.
			There can't be too many non-Camorites
			among them. Try
			scanning for human life-signs.
			I am detecting seven humans...
			three are female... however they
			are all too young to be Miranda
			Vigo.
			What about males?
			One is an infant... another is
			elderly... and two are middleaged.
			That's seven, you said there were
			eight humans.
			I am having difficulty getting a
			clear reading on the eighth...
			-- the individual appears to be
			located approximately two
			kilometers beneath the planet's
			surface.
			Male or female?
			Male... adult... between twenty
			and thirty years old.
			No one in their right mind would
			go that far underground alone.
			Unless he was forced to.
			Sir, I am reading seismic
			instability in the area. He is in
			danger.
			Relay his coordinates to the
			Transporter Room and have them
			beam him aboard.
			What the... ?
			This is a Federation ship...
			That's right. I'm Captain
			Picard... Jean-Luc Picard.
			I realize I wasn't supposed to be
			spelunking that cave, but don't
			you have something better to do?
			We thought you were in danger.
			Oh... well... I wasn't. Maybe you
			should just beam me back where I
			was?
			Are you Jason Vigo?
			I... know him. Is he in trouble?
			In a manner of speaking...
			someone's made a threat against
			his life.
			Jason... I'm an old friend of your
			Mother's. I came here because
			you're in danger.
			Why would anyone want to kill me?
			The person who made the threat is
			under the impression that... that
			you are my son...
			Am I... ?
			I don't know...
			My mother never told me who my
			father was... just that he was in
			Starfleet.
			Perhaps we should contact her... ?
			She... died a few years ago...
			I'm sorry...
			Jason... I think it's important
			that we find out one way or
			another. Would you be willing to
			permit a genetic test?
			If I'm not your son... is this
			person still going to want to kill
			me?
			Once he's made aware of the fact,
			I expect he won't...
			In that case you won't mind my
			saying that I hope you're not my
			father...
			What were you doing down in that
			cave? Are you a seismologist?
			No, I just enjoy climbing.
			Without an antigrav harness... ?
			They get in the way...
			So... what do you do?
			I'm... between jobs right now.
			I see...
			Excuse me, gentlemen, but I have
			the results if you want to hear
			them.
			Your genetic code is a cross
			between the DNA of your mother,
			Miranda Vigo, and your father --
			Jean-Luc Picard.
			What is all this... ?
			Archaeological fragments I've
			collected over the years...
			This is a Silvan glyph stone...
			And this is a Gorlan prayer
			stick... it's extremely rare...
			Is it valuable... ?
			Not really. Only to students of
			archaeology like myself. Still,
			I had to give up a very old bottle
			of Saurian brandy for it.
			I'd say you got taken.
			Perhaps... but I value it
			nonetheless...
			On Camor, something has value if
			you can eat it or sell it...
			everything else is a luxury.
			Would you like some tea?
			No. Thanks.
			Something else?
			Tea, Earl Grey, hot.
			Well. I'm sure this whole thing
			is as much a surprise to you as it
			is to me...
			I'll be honest with you, Jason.
			I was with your mother for only a
			short time. I would like to have
			known her better... but it didn't
			work out that way.
			You look a lot like her -- it's
			your eyes, I think...
			I want to be clear about one thing --
			your mother didn't tell me about
			you. If she had... I would have
			been part of your life.
			I guess that's not what she
			wanted.
			I think I'd like to go back to the
			surface.
			It would be best if you stayed
			aboard the Enterprise... until we
			can resolve the situation with
			Bok.
			What is the situation with Bok,
			anyway? Why does he want me dead?
			Years ago, I was forced to destroy
			a starship that was under his
			son's command. Apparently Bok
			feels it would be fitting
			vengeance to kill my son.
			I can't hide forever.
			Of course not. We're trying to
			locate Bok... I intend to confront
			him, settle this matter.
			How long will that take?
			I assure you -- no one's more
			eager to get this behind us than
			I am.
			Where do I stay?
			We'll give you quarters.
			Okay. Let's go.
			Jason... your being here... I hope
			it will give us the chance to get
			to know each other.
			We managed to shut down the
			probe's power systems so we could
			beam it aboard, but it's not going
			to be easy to figure out where it
			came from.
			Bok took the precaution of
			encrypting the probe's
			navigational systems so that we
			would be unable to decipher its
			flight path.
			We ran an analysis of the probe's
			hull -- from the energy signatures
			and particle deposits we found, it
			looks like it travelled through a
			Dichromic Nebula, was exposed to
			an intensive gravimetric
			distortion, and passed within a
			light year of a class four pulsar.
			Those phenomena are relatively
			common -- we would need to
			identify at least one of them
			specifically in order to postulate
			a flight path.
			Understood.
			Sir, incoming message from Daimon
			Birta.
			On screen.
			Thank you for taking the time to
			talk to us, Daimon.
			I understand you have a problem.
			Yes, it concerns Daimon Bok.
			Bok is no Daimon. He was relieved
			of command six years ago -- he was
			unstable, dangerous. We had to
			confine him to Rog Prison.
			But he's no longer there?
			He was able to buy himself out
			about two years ago.
			Buy himself out?
			He paid his debt to society.
			Considering that he is dangerous
			and unstable, I trust you've kept
			track of him?
			He's a private citizen. We take
			no responsibility for him.
			I see. Do you have any idea of
			his present whereabouts?
			I understand he was seen in the
			Dorias cluster not too long ago...
			That cluster consists of over
			twenty star systems...
			You don't have to thank me,
			Captain.
			Believe it or not, sir -- that
			might've given us the fix we
			needed. There's a nebula in the
			Dorias cluster that matches the
			particle signature we found on the
			probe.
			There is a class four pulsar three
			light years from the nebula -- my
			calculations indicate that the
			probe was launched in the Xendi
			Kabu system.
			Plot a course and take us out of
			orbit.
			Jean-Luc... come in.
			I think I need to talk to a
			parent.
			What's he like?
			I'm not sure I can tell you. He's
			put up so many barriers... I don't
			really know what's underneath.
			It would certainly be
			understandable if he couldn't
			accept you right away...
			I can't imagine that he'll ever
			accept me. He won't even talk to
			me.
			Keep in mind... he's had twenty
			years to be angry that his father
			wasn't there... it'll take time to
			get over those feelings -- but I
			think it's possible.
			Perhaps. But surely it would be
			wrong of me to force the issue.
			He's made it clear he doesn't want
			to pursue a relationship... I
			believe I should respect his
			feelings.
			Of course you want to take your
			cues from him... move slowly...
			but you might want to keep trying
			to get through those barriers.
			What I sense about this young
			man... is that he's very
			independent.
			I think it's best if I leave him
			alone. Let him come to me if he
			wants.
			Maybe you're right.
			I just think you should consider
			one thing.
			Are you really thinking about
			what's best for Jason... or
			easiest for you?
			Yeah...
			Hello, Jason. I'm Deanna Troi...
			the ship's Counselor.
			Come in...
			Did Captain Picard ask you to come
			talk to me?
			No... I just came to see how you
			were doing. A lot's happened in
			the last few hours... I thought
			you might want to talk about it.
			I'll be all right...
			People have wanted to kill me
			before...
			But you've never met your father
			before.
			I have to admit I never thought I
			would.
			It must be somewhat
			overwhelming...
			I am a little shaky.
			Of course. That's only natural.
			But you know what? Just talking
			to you... I feel better already.
			How did you feel about the Captain --
			about your father?
			He's okay. A little stiff.
			Where are you from?
			I was born on Betazed...
			Do all the women there have eyes
			like yours?
			Jason... I came here to talk to
			you because I'm the ship's
			counselor... if you don't want to
			talk to me in that way, I think I
			should go.
			Fine...
			You're welcome to make an
			appointment to come by my office.
			Maybe I'll do just that.
			Picard... can you hear me?
			I will kill him, Picard. And
			there's nothing you can do about
			it.
			Security to Captain's quarters.
			Our shields were up; how could he
			have beamed through them?
			I don't think he did. Sensor logs
			don't show any sign of an
			intruder.
			Could it have been another
			hologram?
			I don't think so... something has
			to generate a hologram -- we would
			have detected it.
			Bok once used a mind control
			device to make me hallucinate.
			That device gave off a very
			specific energy signature... I'm
			not reading anything like it.
			Could he have modified the device
			so he could use it without being
			detected?
			It's possible... I'll recalibrate
			the sensors to scan for low
			intensity transmissions. And just
			to be sure, I'll sweep your
			quarters with a resonance scanner.
			Good. Keep me posted.
			I want you to assign a security
			detail to Jason.
			What about yourself?
			I'm not the target of Bok's
			threats. Jason is.
			Captain, I have compiled all
			available records pertaining to
			Jason Vigo's criminal record, and --
			His criminal record?
			Yes, sir. He has been charged
			three times for petty theft, twice
			for disorderly conduct, and
			several dozen times for
			trespassing.
			Trespassing?
			I believe the charges were related
			to his climbing activities in the
			caves underneath the planet's
			surface.
			This is the information you
			requested, is it not?
			Yes, thank you.
			What was your name again?
			Lieutenant Rhodes.
			Actually, I meant your first name.
			Sandra...
			Well, Sandra... do you think you
			could give me some room?
			We're supposed to be keeping an
			eye on you.
			Don't you think you can keep an
			eye on me from over there?
			Good morning...
			I thought you said your ship was
			the safest place I could be.
			Why the guards?
			Because... Bok appeared in my
			quarters last night.
			It may not have been Bok -- just
			an image of him. We're
			investigating.
			Look, maybe you should just drop
			me off somewhere and let me watch
			out for myself.
			I don't think that's wise...
			I've been doing it since I was
			fifteen.
			I know you have. But Bok is
			extremely dangerous. He has a
			starship, technology --
			All right, all right. I'll stay
			here.
			You seem to enjoy rock climbing.
			Our Holodeck can create some very
			challenging climbs.
			Why don't I take you down there
			and show you how to use the
			programs?
			Thanks. But I can figure it out
			myself.
			Perhaps we could do a climb
			together...
			I'm probably not as skilled as
			you, but I'm not inexperienced.
			I kind of prefer to climb alone.
			Of course.
			There are other sports programs...
			fending, for example. Have you
			ever fenced?
			Hardly.
			I think it might appeal to you.
			It's very physical... demanding --
			Look... I'm sorry...
			I appreciate what you're trying to
			do. But Captain --
			Captain, father, Jean-Luc -- I
			don't even know what I'm supposed
			to call you... after this thing
			with Bok is over, I'm leaving. So
			when you think about it, there's
			really not much point in our
			getting acquainted.
			Let me know when you catch him,
			all right?
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47829.1.
			We've been in the Xendi Kabu
			system for over three hours, and
			still no sign of Bok.
			I have completed a subspace
			scan... there is an energy
			residual that suggests that a
			Ferengi vessel, possibly several,
			was in this area within the last
			eighteen hours.
			La Forge to Bridge.
			Go ahead.
			I've scanned your quarters, sir...
			I haven't been able to find
			anything that would explain Bok's
			appearance.
			Understood.
			Captain, I am detecting an object
			five thousand kilometers off our
			starboard bow -- it is another
			probe.
			Why didn't we detect it before?
			It must have been cloaked, sir --
			it appeared out of nowhere.
			On screen.
			Another holographic device?
			I do not believe so, sir.
			Captain, the probe's systems are
			overloading.
			Red alert. Shields up!
			Damage report.
			No damage, sir.
			Captain, I do not believe it was
			meant as an attack, but rather as
			a message.
			A message?
			In B'Zal, a Ferengi code which
			uses an alternating pattern of
			light and darkness.
			Can you translate it?
			I am attempting to do so...
			The message appears to read: "My
			revenge is at hand."
			He's proved he can get to us
			whenever he wants. What's he
			waiting for?
			Tea, earl grey -- hot.
			If you want me to stay and talk
			you'd better not call for security
			this time...
			How do you like your boy, Captain?
			Is he everything you'd always
			hoped for?
			It's a risky game you're playing,
			coming here. Next time we'll be
			ready for you. Why don't we
			settle this now?
			How do you propose to do that,
			Picard? You murdered my son.
			It was self-defense. He fired on
			my ship.
			You were in Ferengi space!
			I didn't know that. If he'd told
			me I would have withdrawn.
			I'm sorry, but there's nothing I
			can do to bring him back.
			How touching. But your apology is
			worthless to me. And I demand
			that you repay me for my loss.
			You can't put a price on a life.
			Oh, but you can, Picard. You can
			pay me with your son's life.
			No...
			I'm afraid you don't have any
			choice. I insist on being paid...
			That should do it, but let's run
			a level-three bio-scan just to be
			sure.
			Rhodes to Sickbay! Medical
			emergency -- deck nine, section
			four!
			Have you ever had a seizure like
			this before?
			Not really... sometimes my hands
			shake... but it's never been that
			bad.
			When did it first start to happen?
			A few months ago... do you have
			any idea what's wrong with me?
			You have a condition called
			Forrester-Trent syndrome. It's a
			degenerative neurological disorder --
			very rare.
			What do you mean degenerative?
			If it goes untreated, it can lead
			to paralysis... even death. I'm
			starting you on a neuro-stabilization
			regimen. If we're
			lucky, we should be able to halt
			the degeneration, maybe even
			reverse it.
			The disease is hereditary.
			I know your father doesn't have
			it... was your mother prone to
			seizures?
			Not that I know of.
			There have been a few reported
			cases where the disease was
			instigated by random mutation...
			I'll run a micro-cellular scan to
			see if that's what happened.
			In the meantime, I want you to
			take it easy, get some rest.
			Is he going to be all right... ?
			I wish I could say for certain.
			There's no way to know how he'll
			respond to the treatment.
			Is there any... facility we can
			take him to -- where they might
			have special expertise?
			I'm afraid there isn't. But I'll
			do everything I can.
			I know you will... I'm sorry.
			It's just hard for me to accept
			that there's nothing I can do...
			I understand...
			I've been thinking about what you
			said the other day. You were
			right, you know. I convinced
			myself Jason didn't want me to
			reach out to him...
			Because I don't have the faintest
			idea how to do it.
			I don't think anyone is born
			knowing how to be a parent. You
			kind of figure it out as you go.
			But nothing I try seems to work.
			I think anyone who's had a child
			can relate to that.
			If there's one quality parenthood
			tends to require -- it's patience.
			I'm just not sure that's going to
			be enough in his case.
			I found out he has a criminal
			record. Nothing terribly serious --
			petty theft, that sort of thing --
			but... he's a grown man. Is it
			too late for him to turn around?
			That's really up to him.
			Maybe. But you can't blame
			yourself for not having been
			there. All you can do is be there
			for him now.
			And be patient.
			And be patient.
			I think we've found something...
			Bok was in direct contact with
			this chair for an extended
			period... it is showing a
			distinctive subspace signature as
			a result.
			We think he's using some sort
			of... subspace transporter to
			beam aboard the Enterprise.
			My understanding is that such
			devices were impractical.
			The Federation abandoned its
			research in the field because the
			technology was found to be
			unreliable... as well as extremely
			energy intensive.
			In order to transport matter
			through subspace, you have to put
			it into a state of quantum flux --
			it's very unstable.
			The quantum effect would explain
			why our sensors did not detect
			Bok's presence.
			It would also explain why he was
			able to penetrate our shields.
			What range would this kind of
			transporter have?
			In theory it could operate over
			several light years.
			That means the probe that exploded
			could have been beamed into
			position from some point outside
			sensor range.
			If Bok uses his transporter again,
			we may be able to trace the
			subspace signature and locate his
			ship.
			Is there any way to keep him from
			beaming aboard the Enterprise
			again?
			I don't think there is...
			If he has the ability to beam
			aboard, he might be able to beam
			someone away.
			It is a possibility.
			I'm concerned that he's going to
			try to take Daniel -- is there any
			way we can protect him?
			We could keep a signal lock on him
			at all times... if Bok tried to
			beam him away, we might be able to
			keep him from getting a pattern
			lock.
			In order to do so, we would have
			to tie the ship's subspace field
			coils into the transporter system.
			Make it so.
			Open.
			Would you mind waiting outside?
			Not bad...
			I like climbing. There's
			something about... literally
			having your fate in your own
			hands.
			I know.
			I came to tell you that we may
			have found a way to locate Bok's
			ship... this might be over soon.
			You came all the way up here just
			to tell me that?
			I thought it might make you feel
			better.
			Thanks.
			That was nice of you.
			Jason... after your mother and I
			parted... I lost track of her
			completely.
			I'd like to know more about what
			happened to her... if you don't
			mind telling me.
			Like what?
			Well... why did you go to Camor?
			It seems an unlikely place for a
			woman and a child...
			You know what she was like...
			See a stray cat -- take it in.
			See someone cold -- give them your
			coat.
			That was Miranda, all right.
			She heard about the children on
			Camor who'd been orphaned during
			the Cardassian war.
			I see...
			I was only ten when we went there.
			I remember her telling me about
			all the boys and girls who didn't
			have anybody to take care of
			them...
			So she found this big house...
			practically falling apart... and
			started rounding up children.
			Eventually, there were over forty
			of them...
			She called it a school. She got
			up before dawn and she went to bed
			after midnight and in between she
			never stopped working. She taught
			everyone to read... she grew
			vegetables in hardpan to feed
			us... and she made sure we knew
			how to sing.
			That was important in a place like
			Camor...
			Then one day... two men attacked
			her... on the street in broad
			daylight... for the food she was
			carrying...
			If she'd just given it to them,
			they probably wouldn't have hurt
			her. But she knew we needed the
			food...
			So they killed her.
			I'm sorry...
			Don't be sorry for me. My mother
			made sure we were all tough enough
			to make it.
			Jason... isn't there some way I
			can be a father to you?
			My father and I were estranged...
			he thought I should stay home and
			tend the vineyards and I wanted to
			join Starfleet. He died before we
			could come to terms about it...
			and I've regretted that all my
			life.
			I don't want the same thing to
			happen to us.
			Don't you understand? I'm not
			anyone you'd want for a son.
			Trust me -- if you knew anything
			about me, you wouldn't be trying
			so hard.
			That's not so...
			No? Well let me spell it out for
			you. I've been in trouble since
			I was a teenager... I steal, I
			lie, I use people. I'm a
			criminal. That's what your son
			is.
			I know.
			I'm aware of your trouble with the
			Camor authorities.
			You are?
			It doesn't change anything.
			You're still my son. And, like it
			or not, I'm your father. I don't
			know what that means, but I know
			it means something. That we're...
			connected...
			Yes...
			At the very least...
			-- I know you'll never look at
			your hairline the same way again.
			Come on -- let's get to the top of
			this thing...
			You wanted to see me?
			It's about Jason...
			I finished the micro-cellular scan
			I was running... there's something
			you need to know...
			Sir... sensors detect a subspace
			carrier wave heading toward the
			ship...
			-- its signature is consistent
			with Bok's transporter.
			Can you tell what part of the ship
			it's headed toward?
			Not yet, Commander.
			See if you can track the signature
			and locate Bok's ship.
			Geordi, are you ready down there?
			I've got a signal lock on Jason.
			Riker to Captain --
			Picard, here.
			Bok is trying to use his
			transporter.
			The transporter beam is focusing
			on deck nine, section four.
			Jason's quarters...
			I'm on it, Commander.
			What's wrong?
			Security to Bridge -- Bok is
			beaming Jason off the ship!
			Initiating transport, now --
			I'm losing his signal...
			Bok's re-establishing his lock...
			Have you been able to locate Bok's
			ship?
			No, sir. The subspace signature
			left by his transporter is
			decaying more rapidly than
			predicted -- it may not be
			possible to trace it.
			Sir, another probe has
			materialized five hundred
			kilometers to starboard...
			-- it is sending a transmission.
			On screen.
			This is a very special day,
			Picard. Fifteen years ago you
			took my son away from me... today,
			I will take yours away from you.
			It will be... our anniversary.
			I wanted you to see him one last
			time... so you could cherish his
			memory forever...
			I have traced the transporter beam
			Bok used to send the probe -- His
			ship is holding position
			approximately three hundred
			billion kilometers from here...
			Plot a course -- maximum warp.
			Even at warp nine we won't get
			there for almost twenty minutes...
			The modifications you made to our
			Transporter... is there any way
			you could try a subspace transport
			from here and get me aboard Bok's
			ship?
			It may be possible, but it would
			not be advisable.
			You're with me.
			You know... if you're trying to
			make Captain Picard suffer,
			killing me won't do it.
			We didn't exactly hit it off. I
			think I'm something of an
			embarrassment to him.
			You're lying. Picard would never
			reject his own son.
			I mean it -- he cares more about
			his crew than he does about me.
			You are a clever young man. But
			I do not believe that Picard will
			be unaffected by your death.
			Daimon... if you kill him, the
			human will not pay the ransom.
			He will... Picard won't know the
			boy is dead until it's too late...
			Yes, Daimon...
			There... I've aligned the field
			coils...
			The phase dampers are in synch...
			standing by to modulate the
			transport pattern...
			Sir, we might be able to get you
			over there, but I don't see how
			we're going to get you back.
			We'll deal with that when the time
			comes.
			The transport is going to take
			longer than normal... we're going
			to have to shunt your pattern
			through the subspace field
			coils...
			Understood...
			Initiating transport sequence...
			now...
			Look... maybe we could make a
			deal.
			What kind of deal?
			Tell my father you killed me...
			Put a phaser burn on my shirt and
			send it to him. He'll think I'm
			dead. That's what's important,
			isn't it?
			I have friends on Camor Five
			who'll make it worth your while.
			I understand your desire to live.
			But I want Picard to see your body --
			so there will be no doubt.
			Lower your weapons or Bok is
			dead...
			Lower yours... or your son dies.
			You know as well as I do, Bok...
			he's not my son.
			I know what you did... Miranda
			Vigo is Jason's mother... but, I
			am not his father... it only
			appeared as if I were because you
			resequenced his DNA...
			But your technique was flawed...
			Jason began to suffer from a
			neurological disorder... when my
			ship's Doctor investigated its
			cause, she discovered what you'd
			done...
			Now he'll never pay the ransom...
			There was never going to be any
			ransom. All Bok has ever cared
			about was vengeance.
			Is this true, Daimon?
			He is no longer a Daimon -- he was
			stripped of command.
			They had no right to do that to
			me.
			He lied to you so you'd help him
			carry out his plan.
			The Enterprise is closing in on
			your position... if you let us
			both go now, you won't be
			attacked.
			Your crew won't attack -- not
			while you're on board.
			They'll cripple your vessel and
			keep you here until the Ferengi
			authorities arrive.
			You'll have a great deal of
			explaining to do... your only hope
			is to turn Bok over to them and
			tell them that he deceived you.
			There is no profit in this for
			us...
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47831.8.
			At Jason's request, the Enterprise
			has returned to Camor Five.
			Doctor Crusher said I'm responding
			well to the treatment... she
			thinks the damage is going to be
			completely reversed...
			I'm glad to hear it...
			Are you sure you wouldn't like to
			stay aboard the Enterprise for a
			few more days?
			I can't... I have a life on
			Camor...
			-- it's a bit of a mess, but I
			want to go back and try to
			straighten things out...
			I understand...
			Well...
			Maybe... next time you come back
			this way, you can look me up...
			I will...
			I slipped a little something into
			your bag while you were packing...
			I know you'd prefer a bottle of
			Saurian brandy... but this is all
			I could come up with.
			I... I can't accept this...
			I want you to have it...
			Energize...
