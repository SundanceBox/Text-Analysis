			That was an incredible program.
			I am glad you approve. I have
			always found the Black Sea at
			night to be a most... stimulating
			experience.
			Worf, we were strolling barefoot
			along the beach while balalaika
			music played in the air... ocean
			breeze washing over us... stars in
			the sky... a full moon rising...
			and the most you can say is
			"stimulating"?
			It was... very stimulating.
			The truth is, I don't spend nearly
			enough time on the Holodeck.
			I should take my own advice and
			use it to relax.
			Next time, I'll choose the
			program. If you like the Black
			Sea, you're going to love Lake
			Cataria on Betazed.
			Deanna... perhaps before there is
			a "next time" we should discuss...
			Commander Riker.
			Why, is he coming along?
			No... but I do not wish to... I
			mean, it would be unfortunate if
			he... if you and I are going to
			continue... I do not want to hurt
			his feelings...
			Worf... I think it's all right to
			concentrate on our feelings...
			yours... and mine.
			Counselor!
			What's today's date? The date?
			Stardate 47988.
			47988...
			Captain, what's wrong?
			I'm not sure... I don't know
			how... or why, but...
			I'm moving back and forth through
			time.
			It was as though I had physically
			left the ship and gone to another
			time and place... I was in the
			past...
			Can you describe where you were...
			what it looked like?
			It's all slipping away so fast...
			like waking up from a nightmare...
			It was years ago... before I took
			command of the Enterprise. I was
			talking with someone... I don't
			remember who...
			But then -- everything changed.
			I wasn't in the past any longer...
			I was an old man, in the future...
			I was doing something outside...
			what was it?
			I'm sorry. It's gone. I can't
			remember...
			It's all right. Have you
			considered the possibility that
			this was just a dream?
			It was more than a dream... the
			smells and the sounds... the way
			things felt to the touch... it was
			all so real...
			How long did you stay in each of
			these time periods? Did it seem
			like minutes... hours?
			I'm not sure.
			At first... there was a moment of
			confusion, of disorientation. I
			wasn't sure where I was. But that
			passed... and then I felt
			perfectly natural... as though I
			belonged in that time. But I
			can't remember how long I stayed
			there.
			I know this doesn't make much
			sense... it's a feeling more than
			a distinct memory.
			Maybe we can identify specific
			symbols. Can you remember
			anything you saw, an object, a
			building perhaps --
			Captain Picard to the Bridge!
			Sir, I think we have a problem
			with the warp core, or the phase
			inducers, or some other damn
			thing.
			Geordi...
			Hello, Captain... or should I make
			that Ambassador?
			Hasn't been Ambassador for a while
			either.
			How about Mister Picard?
			How about... Jean-Luc?
			I don't know if I can get used to
			that.
			Good Lord, Geordi. How long has
			it been?
			Oh... about nine years.
			No, no... I mean, since you last
			called me Captain? When was the
			last time we were all together...
			on the Enterprise?
			Close to twenty-five years.
			Twenty-five years...
			Time's been good to you.
			It's been a little too good to me
			in some places.
			Can I give you a hand?
			Oh... I'm just tying some vines.
			Looks like you've got leaf miners.
			Might want to use a bacillus
			spray.
			My wife is quite a gardener. I've
			picked up a little bit of it.
			How is Leah?
			Busy as ever. She's just been
			made director of the Daystrom
			Institute.
			And the little ones... Bret and
			Alandra? And...
			And Sidney. Not so little any
			more. Bret's applying to
			Starfleet Academy next year.
			So what brings you here?
			Oh... I just thought I'd drop by.
			I'd been thinking about the old
			days on the Enterprise... and I
			was in the neighborhood...
			Don't give me that. You don't
			make the trip from Rigel Three to
			Earth just to... drop by.
			No.
			So. You've heard.
			Well... Leah has a few friends at
			Starfleet medical... and word gets
			around.
			I'm not an invalid, you know.
			Irumodic Syndrome can take years
			to run its course.
			I know. But when I heard I
			just... wanted to come by all the
			same.
			Well... as long as you're here,
			you can help me carry in some of
			these tools.
			My cooking may not be up to Leah's
			standards, but I can still make a
			decent cup of tea.
			By the way, I read your last
			novel. Not bad. I thought the
			protagonist was written a bit
			flamboyantly, but that's just my --
			Captain, are you all right?
			Captain?
			Captain?
			Are you all right, sir?
			Sir... ?
			I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind
			seems to have wandered for a
			moment...
			What were you saying?
			I was asking if you'd ever been
			aboard a Galaxy Class starship
			before, sir.
			No. I'm, of course, very familiar
			with the blueprints and
			specifications... but this will
			be my first time aboard.
			Well then, sir, if I may be so
			bold -- you're in for a treat.
			The Enterprise is quite a ship.
			I'm sure she is.
			Have I done something wrong, sir?
			No. You just seem very...
			familiar.
			Enterprise to Shuttlecraft
			Galileo. You are cleared for
			arrival in Shuttlebay Two.
			Acknowledged, Enterprise.
			There she is...
			Captain?
			Tasha... I was just with Tasha, in
			the shuttle...
			Troi to Doctor Crusher.
			Something's wrong with the
			Captain. We're on our way to
			Sickbay.
			I've finished the neurographic
			scan. I don't see anything that
			might cause hallucinations or a
			psychogenic reaction.
			Is there any indication of
			temporal displacement?
			No. Usually a temporal shift
			would leave some kind of trypamine
			residue in the cerebral cortex.
			But the scan didn't find any.
			Personally, I think you just enjoy
			waking everyone up in the middle
			of the night.
			Actually, I just like running
			around the ship in my bare feet.
			The bio-spectral test results,
			Doctor.
			Your blood gas analysis is
			consistent with someone who's been
			breathing the ship's air for
			weeks.
			If you'd been somewhere else,
			there would be some indication of
			a change in your oxygen isotope
			ratios.
			Thanks, Alissa.
			Deanna... would you excuse us?
			Of course.
			Jean-Luc... I scanned for any
			evidence of Irumodic Syndrome, as
			you suggested. There wasn't any.
			But I did detect a small
			structural defect in your parietal
			lobe.
			A defect... that you've never
			noticed before?
			It's the kind of thing that would
			only show up on a level four
			neurographic scan.
			It could leave you susceptible to
			several neurological disorders...
			including Irumodic Syndrome.
			Now, it's possible you could have
			that defect for the rest of your
			life without developing a
			problem...
			... but even if you do... many
			people lead perfectly normal lives
			for a long time after the onset of
			Irumodic Syndrome.
			Then why do you look like you've
			just signed my death sentence?
			Sorry.
			I guess... this has caught me off
			guard.
			Well, let's not worry about it.
			Something tells me you're going to
			have to put up with me for a very
			long time.
			It won't be easy, but I'll manage.
			Did Worf find anything?
			No, sir. His security scans came
			up negative.
			They're checking the sensor
			logs... but there's still no
			indication that you left the ship.
			It wasn't a dream... something did
			happen.
			Worf to Captain.
			Go ahead, Lieutenant.
			Sir -- there is an incoming
			transmission from Admiral
			Nakamura. It is a priority one
			message.
			Beverly?
			Mister Worf, route it through to
			Doctor Crusher's office.
			Captain.
			Admiral.
			I'm initiating a fleetwide Yellow
			Alert. Starfleet intelligence has
			picked up some disturbing reports
			from the Romulan Empire. It
			appears that at least thirty
			Warbirds have been pulled from
			other assignments and are heading
			for the Neutral Zone.
			Is there any indication why they
			would make such a blatantly
			aggressive move?
			Our operatives on Romulus have
			indicated that there appears to be
			something happening in the Neutral
			Zone -- specifically, in the
			Devron System. Our own long range
			scans have picked up some kind of
			spatial anomaly in the area, but
			we can't tell what it is.
			What are our orders?
			This is a delicate situation. I'm
			deploying fifteen starships along
			our side of the Neutral Zone. I
			want you to go there as well --
			see if you can find out what's
			going on in the Devron System.
			Am I authorized to enter the Zone?
			Not yet. Wait and see what the
			Romulans do. You can conduct long-range
			scans, send probes if
			necessary... but don't cross the
			border unless they do.
			Understood.
			Captain... what's wrong?
			This isn't my time. I belong
			somewhere else...
			What?
			I mean... I... I wasn't here a
			moment ago...
			What do you mean? You've been
			right here with me...
			No, no... I was somewhere else...
			a long time ago...
			I was talking to someone...
			Beverly... Beverly was there...
			It's okay, Captain... everything's
			going to be all right.
			I'm not senile. It did happen.
			I was here, with you... and then
			I was in another place...
			It was... it was back on the
			Enterprise!
			At least, I think it was... it
			seemed like Sickbay... but maybe
			it was a hospital... or...
			Captain, I think we should go back
			to the house... call a doctor...
			No. I know what you're thinking.
			It's the Irumodic Syndrome -- it's
			beginning to -- to affect the old
			man's mind. Well, it's not that.
			And I wasn't daydreaming, either.
			All right... all right... what do
			you want do about it?
			I want to see Data.
			Data... Why?
			I think he can help...
			Help -- how?
			I don't know! I don't know, but
			I want to see him!
			Okay... we'll go see Data. Is he
			still at Cambridge?
			Yes... yes... I think he's...
			Do you see them?
			See... who?
			They're everywhere... laughing at
			me... why are they laughing?
			Come on, Captain... let's go see
			Data.
			Yes... Data... yes...
			I know how it sounds... but it
			happened. It was real. I was
			back on the Enterprise.
			How do you like your tea?
			Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.
			Of course it's hot. What do ya
			want in it?
			Nothing...
			This is quite a place you have
			here, Data. I see they treat
			Professors pretty well at
			Cambridge...
			Holding the Lucasian Chair does
			have its perquisites. This house
			originally belonged to Sir Isaac
			Newton when he held the position.
			It has become the traditional
			residence.
			If you're really his friend,
			you'll get him to take that grey
			out of his hair. He looks like a
			bloody skunk.
			She can be trying at times.
			But she does make me laugh.
			What is it with your hair, anyway?
			I have found that a touch of gray
			adds an air of... distinction.
			Is this Earl Grey? I'd swear it
			was breakfast tea.
			Captain, when was the last time
			you saw a physician about your
			Irumodic Syndrome?
			A week ago. I was prescribed
			peridaxon.
			And yes, I know it's not a cure...
			nothing can stop the deterioration
			of my... my synaptic pathways...
			You think I'm senile... that this
			is all some... delusion.
			No one said anything like that.
			In all honesty, Captain, it's a
			thought that has occurred to me.
			However, there is nothing to
			disprove what you are saying,
			either. So it's possible
			something is happening to you.
			The first thing we should do is
			give you a complete series of
			neurographic scans. We can use
			the equipment at the bio-metrics
			lab here on campus.
			Jessel, ask Professor Rippert to
			take over my lecture for tomorrow
			and possibly for the rest of the
			week.
			That's the Data I remember! I
			knew I could count on you!
			Commanding officer...
			Enterprise... arriving.
			To Captain Jean-Luc Picard,
			Stardate 41148...
			... You are hereby requested and
			required to take command...
			... to take command of the USS
			Enterprise as of this date.
			Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie,
			Starfleet Command.
			Red Alert! All hands to Battle
			Stations!
			You heard him -- move!
			Personal Log: Stardate 41153.7.
			Recorded under security lockout
			Omega three-two-seven. I have
			decided not to inform this crew of
			my experiences. If it's true that
			I've travelled to the past, I
			cannot risk giving them
			foreknowledge of what's to come.
			Report.
			We've completed a full subspace
			scan of the ship and surrounding
			space. We detected no unusual
			readings or anomalies.
			With all due respect, sir... it
			would help if we knew what we were
			looking for.
			Noted.
			Counselor, do you sense anything
			unusual aboard the Enterprise...
			an alien presence that doesn't
			belong here... perhaps operating
			on a level of intelligence far
			superior to our own?
			No, sir. I'm only aware of the
			crew... and the families aboard
			the ship.
			Mister Worf, I want you to
			initiate a Level Two Security
			Alert on all decks until further
			notice.
			Sir, with all due respect... I'm
			the Security Chief on this ship.
			Unless you're planning to make a
			change...
			No... no, of course not. Security
			Alert Two, Lieutenant.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain Picard to the Bridge,
			Please.
			On my way, Chief.
			Sir, Starfleet has just issued an
			alert. It appears that a number
			of vessels are moving toward the
			Neutral Zone between Romulan and
			Federation space.
			What kind of vessels?
			Freighters, transports... all
			civilian. None of them Federation
			ships.
			It says a large spatial anomaly
			has appeared in the Neutral
			Zone...
			In the Devron System.
			Perhaps it is a Romulan trick --
			to lure ships into the Neutral
			Zone as an excuse for a military
			strike.
			Starfleet's cancelling our mission
			to Farpoint Station and ordering
			us to the Neutral Zone as soon as
			we can leave spacedock.
			No... no, we'll proceed to
			Farpoint.
			Sir?
			You heard me.
			But Captain -- the security of the
			Federation may be at stake!
			Man your station, Mister Worf.
			Captain, perhaps if we understood
			your thinking, if you could
			explain --
			I don't intend to explain
			anything...
			... to anyone. We will proceed to
			Farpoint Station, as originally
			planned.
			Now, if I'm not mistaken, Chief,
			we're having some problems with
			the warp plasma inducers.
			That's right, sir.
			I think I know a way to get them
			back on-line. You're with me.
			We'll be in Main Engineering.
			I do not understand. The Romulans
			may be planning an attack, and he
			does not seem to care.
			Are you certain this is the same
			man who commanded the Stargazer?
			As far as I know.
			What are you going to do?
			I'm going to do what I'm told....
			prepare to go to Farpoint.
			Mister O'Brien, use these
			specifications to bypass the
			secondary plasma inducer.
			You have to realize, sir... this
			isn't exactly my area of
			expertise. The Chief Engineer
			should be making these
			modifications.
			But the Chief Engineer isn't on
			board yet.
			Mister O'Brien... trust me. I
			know you can do this.
			All those years you spent as a
			child... building model starship
			engines... were well worth it.
			How'd you know that, sir?
			From... your Starfleet records.
			Yes, sir. I'll get right to the
			modifications.
			Fletcher -- tell Munoz and Lee to
			get up here right away. We have
			to realign the entire power grid.
			We're all going to be burning the
			midnight oil on this one.
			That would be inadvisable.
			Excuse me?
			If you attempt to ignite a
			petroleum product on this ship at
			zero-hundred hours -- it will
			activate the fire suppression
			system, which will seal off this
			entire compartment.
			Sir... that was just an
			expression.
			An expression of what?
			A figure of speech... I was trying
			to tell him that... we were going
			to be working late...
			Ah. Then "to burn the midnight
			oil" implies late work?
			That's right.
			I am curious. What is the
			etymology of that idiom? How did
			it come to be used in contemporary
			language?
			I... don't know, sir...
			Commander Data, welcome aboard --
			it's good to see you.
			It is... good to see you, too,
			sir.
			I could use your help with the
			infusor array.
			Certainly.
			As you can see, we're having
			difficulty with the plasma
			conduits...
			This will require a completely new
			field induction subprocessor.
			It appears that we will be
			required to... ignite the midnight
			petroleum, sir.
			Jean-Luc... what's going on?
			It happened again.
			A time shift?
			Yes...
			What happened?
			It's still a little vague, but I
			can remember more this time. I
			think the more I shift between
			time periods, the more memory I
			retain...
			First, I was in what appeared to
			be the future... years from now.
			Then I was in the past again...
			right before our first mission...
			What is it?
			I just scanned his temporal lobe
			and compared it to the scan I
			performed just a few minutes ago.
			There's a thirteen percent
			increase of acetylcholine in his
			hippocampus.
			Within a matter of minutes, you
			accumulated over two days worth of
			memories.
			Counselor, do you remember the
			first day I came aboard the
			Enterprise?
			Yes.
			What happened after the welcoming
			ceremony?
			There was a reception in Ten
			Forward... I introduced you to
			Worf and the other senior
			officers...
			Do you have any memory of me
			calling for a Red Alert in
			spacedock? Do you remember
			Starfleet diverting us from
			Farpoint to the Neutral Zone to
			investigate a spatial anomaly?
			No...
			It would appear that there is a
			discontinuity between the time
			periods you have described.
			Events in one time period would
			seem to have no effect on the
			other two.
			And yet in both the past and the
			present -- there's a report of the
			same anomaly in the Devron System.
			It's hard to believe that's a
			coincidence.
			For all I know, there may be one
			in the future, too.
			Maybe the anomaly is some kind
			of... temporal disruption.
			But how is all this related to
			your time shifting?
			These are good questions. And I
			suspect I might find some answers
			when I return to the past... but
			for now we're facing a potentially
			dangerous threat from the
			Romulans.
			All departments should submit
			combat readiness reports by oh
			eight hundred hours tomorrow.
			Dismissed.
			Looks like it's going to be a late
			night... want to get some dinner
			first?
			Actually, I...
			I mean... we have plans.
			Oh... I see. Well then... see you
			tomorrow morning.
			Goodnight, sir.
			Worf...
			... and I want continuous subspace
			sweeps. We might detect a
			temporal disturbance.
			Aye sir.
			Wil... this time shifting... when
			it happens, I experience a moment
			of disorientation. If this should
			happen during a crisis, I want you
			to be ready to take command
			immediately.
			Number One?
			Sorry, Captain. Be prepared to
			take command. Aye sir.
			Speaking of disorientation... are
			you all right?
			Just a little distracted. I'm
			fine.
			You have the Bridge. I'll be in
			my Ready Room.
			Come.
			Milk, warm -- dash of nutmeg.
			What's this?
			A prescription. A glass of warm
			milk and eight hours uninterrupted
			sleep.
			Beverly...
			Doctor's orders. You're
			exhausted. I don't know if you've
			slept in the past or the future...
			but I know you haven't slept in
			the present.
			Get some rest, or I'll have you
			relieved and sedated.
			Yes, sir.
			What's wrong?
			Beverly.
			As a physician, it's often my job
			to give people unpleasant news...
			to tell them that they need
			surgery or that they can't have
			children...
			Or that they might be facing a
			difficult illness...
			You said yourself it's only a
			possibility.
			But you've been to the future...
			you know it's going to happen.
			I prefer to think of the future as
			something that is not written in
			stone. A lot of things can happen
			in twenty-five years.
			A lot of things can happen.
			Sir? Wake up... sir?
			Yes... yes, what is it? Have we
			reached the Neutral Zone?
			The Neutral Zone?
			Sorry... I was... in the past
			again...
			What's going on?
			Data's arranged for us to run some
			tests on you in the bio-metrics
			lab. We're ready to go if you
			are.
			No... no, we don't have time for
			that. We have to get to the
			Neutral Zone.
			Why?
			In the other two time periods...
			Starfleet reported a... uh... some
			kind of... spatial anomaly in
			the... in the...
			... in the Devron System! The
			Devron System in the Neutral Zone!
			Sir...
			If the anomaly was in the past...
			it might be here, too. We have to
			go find out...
			Just because you've seen it in two
			other time frames, doesn't mean
			it's going to be here.
			But if it is -- that means
			something! Damnit, Geordi -- I
			know what we have to do!
			Okay... but first of all, there is
			no Neutral Zone, remember?
			Right... right. Klingons... in
			this time period, the Klingons
			have taken over the Romulan
			Empire...
			And the relations between us and
			the Klingons aren't real cozy
			right now.
			I know that. I haven't completely
			lost my mind, you know.
			Sorry, Geordi... it's hard for me
			to concentrate... and remember
			things... I don't mean to take
			out that frustration on you...
			It's okay...
			Well, if we're going to the Devron
			System, we're going to need a
			ship.
			I think it's time to call in some
			old favors...
			Contact Admiral Riker at Starbase
			Two-four-seven.
			Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to
			help... but frankly, what you're
			asking for is impossible. The
			Klingons have closed their borders
			to all Federation starships.
			Wil... if this... spatial anomaly
			really is in the Devron System...
			I saw a report from Starfleet
			Intelligence on that sector this
			morning. There's no activity...
			there's nothing unusual happening
			in the Devron System.
			I don't believe that! Maybe their
			long-range scanners are flawed...
			we have to go there, see for
			ourselves!
			Data, what do you make of all
			this?
			I am not certain. I cannot
			disprove what the Captain is
			saying.
			And he is convinced he is
			travelling back and forth through
			time.
			Right.
			Look, I've got the Yorktown out
			near the border... I'll have them
			run some long range scans of the
			Devron System... if they find
			anything, I'll let you know.
			That's not good enough.
			It's going to have to be. I'm
			sorry. That's all I can do.
			Riker out.
			Computer -- restore holographic
			image.
			Damn him anyway... after all we've
			been through together... he's been
			sitting behind that desk too long.
			Well... I guess all we can do is
			wait to see if the Yorktown finds
			anything.
			There is another option.
			We could arrange passage aboard a
			medical ship.
			Medical ship?
			Yes. There was an outbreak of
			Terrellian Plague on Romulus. The
			Klingons have been allowing
			Federation medical ships to cross
			the border.
			Yes... yes...
			So now all we need is a medical
			ship.
			I think I can arrange that.
			Find the USS Pasteur. I have some
			pull with the Captain.
			At least, I used to...
			Well... this is a page out of the
			past. I never thought I'd see any
			one of you on a starship again.
			Data, Geordi...
			Let's just... choose one.
			Well. Did you get my message?
			Yes. Jean-Luc... going into
			Klingon territory -- it's insane.
			But I never could say no to you.
			Ah. So that's why you married me.
			Now... the first order of business
			is to get clearance to cross the
			Klingon border.
			What about Worf? Isn't he still
			on the Klingon High Council?
			I'm not sure. Information on the
			Klingon political structure is
			hard to come by these days.
			However, at last report Worf was
			governor of H'atoria, a small
			Klingon colony near the border.
			Worf... yes, that's it... that's
			the answer. Worf. He'll help us.
			Let's make it so.
			Captain Picard?
			Yes?
			Yes?
			Captain, McKinley Station is
			signalling. They want to know
			when we'll be docking.
			Tell McKinley that we've been
			called away on a priority mission.
			We won't be docking.
			Aye, sir.
			Kept the name, eh?
			I've prepared quarters for you on
			Deck Five if you'd like some rest.
			I'm fine. I don't need any rest.
			Nell, please escort the Ambassador
			to his quarters--
			I can find my way around a
			starship!
			You're all treating me like an
			invalid, but I assure you I've got
			a few years left. I don't need to
			be led around and I don't want to
			be patronized.
			You're right. I'm sorry.
			I'll go have a rest.
			How long since he's had a
			neurological scan?
			I'm not sure, but don't waste your
			time suggesting it. He says he's
			not taking "any more damn tests."
			Do you believe he's moving through
			time?
			I don't know if I do, either...
			but -- he's Jean-Luc Picard. And
			if he wants to go on one more
			mission, that's what we're going
			to do.
			Ensign Chilton, set course for
			H'atoria.
			We'll find the anomaly... I know
			we will...
			Report.
			We're nearing the coordinates you
			gave me, sir.
			Is there anything unusual in the
			vicinity?
			How would you define unusual, sir?
			Every region of space has unique
			properties that cannot be found
			anywhere else.
			There should be a... "barrier" of
			some sort nearby. A large plasma
			field... highly disruptive.
			Nothing, sir.
			It's the right time... right
			place... he should be here...
			Who, sir?
			Q! We're here! This has gone on
			long enough! What sort of game
			are you playing?
			Counselor, do you sense an alien
			presence?
			No, sir.
			What is a... "Q"?
			It's a letter of the alphabet, as
			far as I know.
			This is not the way it's supposed
			to happen...
			Maintain position here. I'll be
			in my Ready Room.
			Mon Capitan... I thought you'd
			never get here.
			Q... I thought so. What's going
			on?
			It's Judge Q to you. And isn't it
			obvious what's going on?
			The last time I stood in this
			courtroom was seven years ago...
			"Seven years ago... " How little
			you mortals understand time. Must
			you be so linear, Jean-Luc?
			You accused me of being the
			representative of a barbarous
			species...
			I believe my exact words were "a
			dangerous, savage, child-race."
			But we demonstrated that mankind
			has become peaceful and
			benevolent. You agreed, and let
			us go on our way.
			Why do I find myself back in this
			courtroom?
			You'd like me to connect the dots
			for you. Lead you from A... to
			B... to C... so your puny mind
			can comprehend.
			How boring. They would be so much
			more entertained if you tried to
			figure this out...
			I'll answer any ten questions that
			call for a "yes" or a "no."
			Well?
			Are you putting mankind on trial
			again?
			No.
			Is there any connection at all
			between the trial seven years
			ago... and whatever's going on
			now?
			Hmmmmm... I would have to say...
			yes.
			The spatial anomaly in the Neutral
			Zone -- is it related to what's
			happening?
			Oh, most definitely yes.
			Is it part of a Romulan plot? A
			ploy to start a war?
			No... and no. Five down.
			That's only four --
			"Is it a Romulan plot?" "Is it a
			ploy to start a war?" Those are
			separate questions.
			Did you create the anomaly?
			No, no, no. You're going to be so
			surprised when you realize where
			it came from -- if you ever figure
			it out.
			Are you responsible for my
			shifting through time?
			I'll answer that if you promise
			you won't tell anyone.
			Yes.
			Why?
			Oh, I'm sorry. That's not a "yes
			or no" question. You forfeit the
			rest of your questions.
			I expected as much. You're such
			a limited creature... a perfect
			example of why we've made our
			decision.
			The trial never ended, Captain.
			We never reached a verdict. But,
			now we have: you're guilty.
			Guilty of what?
			Of being inferior.
			Seven years ago I said we'd be
			watching you. And we have been.
			Hoping your ape-like race would
			demonstrate some growth... give
			some indication that your minds
			have room for expansion.
			And what have we seen instead?
			You spending time worrying about
			Commander Riker's career...
			listening to Counselor Troi's
			pedantic psychobabble...
			indulging Data in his witless
			exploration of humanity...
			We have journeyed to countless new
			worlds... made contact with new
			species... expanded man's
			understanding of the universe...
			In your own paltry, limited way.
			You have no idea how far you still
			have to go.
			We are what we are, Q -- and we're
			doing the best we can. It's not
			for you to set the standard by
			which we're judged.
			Oh, but it is. And we have. Time
			may be eternal -- but our patience
			is not.
			Having rendered a verdict... have
			you decided upon a sentence?
			Indeed. It's time to put an end
			to your trek through the stars...
			to make room for other, more
			worthy species.
			We're to be denied travel through
			space?
			Q... even you could not be capable
			of such an act --
			I? There you go again, blaming me
			for everything. Well, this time
			I'm not your enemy. I am not the
			one who causes the annihilation of
			mankind.
			You are.
			Me...
			That's right. You're doing it
			right now... you've already done
			it... and you will do it yet
			again.
			What sort of meaningless doubletalk
			is that?
			He doesn't understand. I have
			only myself to blame, I suppose.
			I believed in you... I thought you
			had potential... but apparently I
			was wrong.
			May whatever God you believe in
			have mercy on your soul. This
			court stands adjourned.
			Commander, assemble the Senior
			Staff and go to Red Alert.
			We have a bigger problem than we
			thought.
			I don't believe him. This has to
			be another one of Q's games. He's
			probably listening to us right
			now, getting a big laugh out of
			watching us jump through his
			hoops.
			I think that this time, we have no
			choice but to take him at his
			word... which means that in some
			fashion, I will cause the
			destruction of humanity.
			But didn't Q say you already had
			caused it?
			And that you were causing it
			now...
			Given the fact that there is an
			apparent discontinuity between the
			three time periods the Captain is
			visiting, Q's statement may be
			accurate, if confusing.
			So what should I do -- just lock
			myself in a room in all three time
			periods?
			No. Maybe not acting is what
			causes the destruction of mankind.
			What if you were needed on the
			Bridge at a key moment, and
			weren't there?
			We can't start second-guessing
			ourselves. I think we have to
			proceed normally... deal with each
			situation as it occurs...
			Agreed.
			I've been thinking about my
			conversation with Q. He admitted
			that he was responsible for my
			shifting through time...
			It occurred to me... that perhaps
			Q is giving me a chance to save
			mankind somehow.
			What makes you say that?
			Q has always shown a certain...
			fascination with humanity... and
			specifically with me. I think he
			has more than a casual interest in
			what happens to me.
			That is true. Q's interest in you
			is very similar to that of a
			master and a beloved pet.
			That was only an analogy, Captain.
			If I weren't traveling through
			time... I would never have
			realized that the anomaly in the
			Neutral Zone appeared there in the
			past as well.
			Assuming that's an important piece
			of a larger puzzle, my ability to
			shift through time may be the key
			to understanding what's going on.
			Bridge to Captain Picard.
			Go ahead.
			We're approaching the Neutral
			Zone, Captain.
			On our way.
			All stop. Initiate a long range
			scan.
			There are four Warbirds holding
			position on the Romulan side of
			the Neutral Zone, Captain.
			The Federation Starships Concord
			and Bozeman are holding position
			on our side.
			Face-off. The question is, who's
			going to move first?
			We are. Mister Worf, hail the
			Romulan flagship.
			The Warbird Terix is responding.
			On screen.
			Captain Picard.
			Hello, Worf. It's been a long
			time.
			Doctor... it is good to see you
			again.
			Did you have a chance to read our
			request?
			Yes. But you must realize... I am
			no longer a member of the High
			Council.
			You are the Governor of the
			H'atoria Colony.
			It is merely a ceremonial position
			given me when the house of Mogh
			was forced from power.
			Worf, surely you still have some
			influence. We must get into the
			Neutral Zone.
			Can't you at least grant us
			permission to cross the border?
			I must refuse. It is for your own
			safety -- the Neutral Zone is
			extremely volatile.
			If Admiral Riker had given you a
			starship with a cloak, you would
			have been safe. I cannot believe
			he refused to help you.
			I don't care what kind of ship
			we're in -- the important thing is
			to get to the Devron System --
			I am sorry, but my first duty is
			to the Empire. I must adhere to
			regulations.
			Maybe I'm just an old man who
			doesn't understand... but the Worf
			I knew cared more about things
			like loyalty and honor than he did
			rules and regulations.
			But then, that was a long time
			ago. Maybe you're not the Worf I
			knew.
			Dor-sHo GHA!
			You have always used your
			knowledge of Klingon honor and
			tradition to get what you want
			from me.
			That's because it always works.
			Your problem, Worf, is that you
			really do have a sense of honor...
			you really do care about things
			like loyalty and trust. Don't
			blame me because I know you too
			well.
			Very well. You may cross the
			border. But only if I come with
			you. I am familiar with the
			Neutral Zone.
			Terms accepted.
			Inform Transporter Room Two to
			beam the Governor aboard.
			I just want to make one thing
			clear, Jean-Luc. If we run into
			any serious opposition, I'm taking
			us back to Federation territory.
			We aren't well armed and we
			wouldn't last long in a fight.
			Governor Worf is aboard, Captain.
			All right. Ensign, set course for
			the Devron System. Warp thirteen.
			Once more, for old time's sake?
			Engage.
			Engage to where, sir?
			Set course for the Devron System,
			and engage at warp nine.
			The Devron System is inside the
			Neutral Zone, sir.
			I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.
			Carry out my orders, Chief.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain... may I have a word with
			you in private?
			Of course.
			Lieutenant, contact Farpoint
			Station. I want to talk to
			Commander Riker.
			Aye, sir.
			Captain, I just want to voice my
			concerns about the way the crew is
			responding to your... unexpected
			orders.
			They don't trust me... they think
			I'm behaving erratically.
			Some do... others are confused...
			it takes some time for a new crew
			to get to know their Captain, and
			for him to know them.
			I understand that. But I know
			what this crew is capable of, even
			if they don't.
			I'm happy to hear you say that.
			It may do them good to hear it, as
			well...
			It would also help if they knew
			what was going on.
			I know it's difficult operating in
			the dark, Counselor. But for now,
			I think it's the only choice.
			Perhaps if you could at least
			indicate why --
			Yar to Captain Picard. I have
			Commander Riker for you, sir.
			Put him through in here.
			Commander. I just wanted to let
			you know we'll be delayed in
			picking you up at Farpoint
			Station.
			I see. May I ask how long?
			I'm not sure. I'll keep you
			updated. Please inform Doctor
			Crusher and Lieutenant La Forge of
			our delay.
			Understood.
			Is there anything else, Counselor?
			Actually... there is, sir. I've
			been debating whether or not to
			mention it... but perhaps...
			It's about Commander Riker.
			What about him?
			Well... I think you should know
			that we... have had a prior
			relationship.
			I see. Do you anticipate this
			interfering with your duties?
			No, sir. It was several years
			ago. And it's well behind us
			both. But I thought you should
			know...
			I appreciate your telling me...
			but I'm sure the two of you will
			find a way to... deal with the
			situation.
			Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.
			That beverage has not been
			programmed into the replication
			system.
			So Captain... how long shall we
			stare at each other across the
			Neutral Zone?
			There is another alternative,
			Tomolak. We're both here for the
			same reason. We could each send
			one ship into the Neutral Zone to
			investigate the anomaly in the
			Devron System.
			Has Starfleet Command approved
			this arrangement?
			No.
			I like it already.
			Agreed. One ship from each
			side... but I warn you -- if
			another Federation starship tries
			to enter the Zone...
			You needn't make threats. I think
			we're all aware of the
			consequences.
			Very well. I'll see you in the
			Devron system.
			Set course for the Devron system.
			Warp five. Engage.
			Sensors are picking up a large
			subspace anomaly directly ahead.
			All stop. On screen.
			Full scan, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			We are approaching the Devron
			system, Captain. Sensors are
			picking up a large subspace
			anomaly directly ahead.
			All stop. Put it onscreen.
			It's bigger in the past...
			Sir?
			Nothing. Full scan, Mister Data.
			Aye, sir.
			On screen! On screen! Let's see
			it!
			As you can see, sir -- there's
			nothing there.
			Still nothing, Captain. I've
			conducted a full sensor sweep out
			to one light year from the
			Pasteur. No temporal anomalies,
			no particle fluctuations...
			nothing.
			Have you scanned the entire
			subspace bandwidth?
			Yes. The subspace barrier is a
			little thin in this region of
			space, but that's not unusual.
			I don't understand. I've already
			seen it in the other two -- the
			other two time periods. Why isn't
			it here?
			Captain. I have been monitoring
			Klingon communication channels...
			several warships have been
			dispatched to this sector to
			search for a... renegade
			Federation vessel.
			You're not thinking about leaving?
			Jean-Luc, there's nothing here...
			There should be -- there has to
			be!
			Data, there must be some other way
			to scan for temporal
			disturbances... something that's
			not covered in a normal sensor
			sweep.
			There are several methods of
			detecting temporal disturbances,
			but we're limited by the equipment
			on the Pasteur. This ship is
			designed primarily for medical
			emergencies.
			Jean-Luc, we've done all we can...
			we should head back to Federation
			territory.
			However, it may be possible to
			modify the main deflector to emit
			an inverse tachyon pulse, which
			could scan beyond the subspace
			barrier.
			Very good! Make it so!
			Wait a minute... Data, how long
			would this take?
			To make the modifications and
			search the entire Devron System
			will take approximately fourteen
			hours.
			All right. Data, begin modifying
			the tachyon pulse. Ensign
			Chilton, lay in a course back to
			the Federation. If we haven't
			found anything in six hours, we're
			heading back at maximum warp.
			Aye, sir.
			Six hours may not be enough. We
			have to stay here until we find it --
			no matter how long it takes!
			Carry out my orders.
			May I see you for a moment?
			Beverly, I can't believe you're
			not willing to stay here until --
			Don't you ever question my orders
			on the Bridge of my ship again!
			I'm just trying to... there are
			larger concerns here... don't you
			understand that --
			I understand that you would never
			have tolerated that kind of
			behavior back on the Enterprise --
			and I won't here. I don't care if
			you're my ex-Captain or my ex-husband.
			You're right... I was out of
			line... it won't happen again...
			But, you have to understand... the
			stakes here are enormous. Q has
			said all of humanity will be
			destroyed...
			I know. And that's why I'm
			willing to stay here a while
			longer and keep looking.
			But I also want you to consider
			the possibility that none of what
			you're saying is real.
			What... ?
			Jean-Luc, I care for you too much
			not to tell you the truth. You
			have advanced Irumodic Syndrome.
			I have to consider the possibility
			that all of this is in your mind.
			I'll stay here six hours... and
			then we're heading home.
			And I want you to remember, if it
			were anyone but you... we wouldn't
			be here at all.
			Eh? What was that she said,
			sonny? I couldn't quite hear
			her...
			Q... what's going on here?
			Where's the anomaly?
			Where's your mommy? I don't
			know...
			Stop this foolishness and answer
			me!
			There is an answer, Jean-Luc. But
			I can't hand it to you. Although
			you do have help...
			What help?
			You aren't alone, you know... what
			you were... and what you will
			become... are always with you.
			My time shifting... the answer
			does lie there...
			Just tell me one thing... this
			anomaly we're looking for... is
			that what destroys humanity?
			You're forgetting, Jean-Luc. You
			destroy humanity.
			By doing what? When? How are you --
			Report, Mister Data.
			The anomaly is two hundred million
			kilometers in diameter. It is a
			highly focused temporal energy
			source which is emitting
			approximately the same energy
			output as ten G-type stars.
			What is the source of that energy?
			I am uncertain. Sensors have been
			unable to penetrate the anomaly.
			What if we modified the main
			deflector to emit an... inverse
			tachyon pulse. That might scan
			beyond the subspace barrier...
			give us an idea what the interior
			of this thing looks like.
			That is a most intriguing idea,
			Captain. I do not believe a
			tachyon beam was ever put to such
			use. I had no idea you were so
			versed in the intricacies of
			temporal theory.
			I have some friends who are quite
			well versed in the matter. Make
			it so.
			Aye, sir.
			I believe we can make the
			necessary modifications in Main
			Engineering.
			We can get more power if we reroute
			the primary EPS taps to the
			deflector array...
			Agreed.
			Initiating tachyon pulse...
			Okay... the pulse is holding
			steady... we're starting to
			receive data from the scan...
			It will take the computer some
			time to give us a complete picture
			of the anomaly's interior. I
			suggest we --
			Whoa...
			What is wrong?
			I'm not sure... oh... it's like
			somebody put an ice pick through
			my temples...
			My VISOR's picking up all kinds of
			electromagnetic distortions.
			Data to Sickbay. Medical
			emergency in Main Engineering.
			Look at his eyes... you can see
			the difference yourself.
			Yes... I can see the iris...
			This is amazing. The DNA in his
			optic nerves is being
			regenerated...
			It's as if he were growing new
			eyes.
			I guess that's why I started to
			feel pain... my optical cortex was
			falling out of alignment with my
			VISOR.
			How is this possible?
			It shouldn't be possible at all.
			There's no medical explanation for
			the spontaneous regeneration of an
			organ.
			Doctor... we've just gotten
			reports from two crewmembers who
			say they have injuries... which
			are healing themselves.
			I believe I may have a partial
			explanation, Captain.
			I have completed my analysis of
			the anomaly. It appears to be a
			multi-phasic temporal convergence
			in the space-time continuum.
			In English please.
			It is, in essence, an eruption
			of... anti-time.
			Anti-time?
			A relatively new concept in
			temporal mechanics. The
			relationship of anti-time to
			normal time is analogous to the
			relationship of anti-matter to
			normal matter.
			So if time and anti-time were to
			collide...
			They would annihilate each
			other... creating a rupture in
			space. I believe this is what has
			happened in the Devron System.
			The rupture may be sending out
			waves of temporal energy which are
			disrupting the normal flow of
			time.
			Then it's possible the DNA
			molecules in Geordi's optic nerves
			aren't regenerating themselves...
			They might be reverting to their
			original state.
			You mean his eyes are getting...
			younger?
			For all intents and purposes, yes.
			So the temporal anomaly has
			certain... rejuvenating effects.
			It certainly doesn't sound like
			the destruction of humanity.
			Data, what could have caused this
			collision between time and anti-time?
			Anti-time, sir?
			I believe that if we modify the
			deflector to send out an inverse
			tachyon pulse, you'll find that
			the anomaly is a rupture between
			time and anti-time.
			That is a fascinating
			hypothesis... how did you
			formulate --
			It would take too long to explain.
			Begin the modifications and send
			out the pulse. Once you've done
			that, start working on a theory as
			to what could have caused this
			rupture.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister O'Brien... how big is the
			anomaly?
			Approximately four hundred million
			kilometers in diameter, sir.
			I still don't understand why it's
			larger here...
			Captain... there are five
			Terrellian transport ships holding
			position in the Devron system.
			We're being hailed by the lead
			ship.
			On screen.
			Enterprise, you are a welcome
			sight. We've been receiving
			threats from the Romulan Empire
			ever since we entered the Neutral
			Zone. I'm glad to see you're here
			to protect us.
			Why have you come here?
			We heard about the Light... from
			a merchant ship who told us about
			the power it has to heal
			illness... to rejuvenate the
			elderly... and we had to come
			here.
			We can't really be certain that
			the... Light... has this power.
			And there may be dangers, side
			effects we're not aware of...
			I have five ships full of sick and
			dying people, Captain. If there's
			even a chance it's true, I can't
			turn back now.
			It would be safer for all
			concerned if you left the Neutral
			Zone... and let us investigate the
			phenomenon more fully.
			No. I've come too far.
			I warn you that if the Romulans
			should decide to intervene, I may
			not be able to protect you.
			I understand. We'll take that
			risk.
			Good luck, Captain.
			You have the Bridge, Lieutenant.
			I'll be in my Ready Room.
			Aye, sir.
			What's going on?
			We're under attack.
			Shield strength down to fifty-two
			percent. Minor damage to the port
			nacelle.
			Two Klingon attack cruisers have
			decloaked to port and starboard.
			Warp speed -- get us out of here!
			Warp power is off-line, sir.
			Heading one-four-eight, mark two-one-five.
			Full impulse.
			Impulse power is fluctuating...
			shields down to thirty percent.
			Weapons status?
			These phasers are no match for
			their shields.
			Geordi, we need warp power -- now.
			Sorry, Captain, they're just too
			much for us. I can't keep the
			phase inducers on-line --
			Shields down to nine percent. One
			more hit and they'll collapse.
			Open a channel.
			This is Captain Beverly Picard.
			We're a medical ship on a mission
			of mercy! Break off your --
			Worf, signal our surrender.
			Tos Vah'cha Worf, do'lo jegh!
			(This is Governor Worf, we
			surrender!)
			Our shields have collapsed. We're
			defenseless.
			Captain, there's another ship de-cloaking
			-- bearing two-one-five
			mark three-one-oh...
			It's the Enterprise!
			They're hailing us.
			I had a feeling you weren't going
			to listen to me. Stand by while
			I try to get the Klingons'
			attention...
			The Enterprise is drawing their
			fire.
			Damage report.
			Our warp core's badly damaged...
			there's a breach in progress.
			Warp core breach... that may be
			it. We have to stop it!
			The Klingon ship is disengaging.
			Admiral Riker is hailing us.
			Our sensors indicate your ship has
			a warp core breach in progress.
			Prepare for emergency beam-out.
			All the Pasteur crew is safely
			aboard, Admiral.
			Raise shields. Where are the
			Klingons?
			They're still moving off, sir --
			half a light year away.
			They'll be back...
			As I said -- I figured you weren't
			going to take no for answer.
			But I thought you would have more
			sense. I can't believe you let a
			defenseless ship cross into
			hostile territory without an
			escort.
			If you had not turned down the
			Captain when he came to you for
			help, none of this would have
			happened. Unlike you, I still
			have a sense of loyalty and
			honor...
			We don't have time for this. The
			Pasteur's core is going to breach.
			Move us away. Full impulse.
			All right. Let's get out of here.
			No... we can't... we have to save
			humanity...
			Engage cloak.
			Our cloak isn't functioning. We
			took a direct hit to the starboard
			plasma coil. Engineering reports
			seven hours until we can cloak
			again.
			We'll have to do this the old-fashioned
			way. Lay in a course
			back to the Federation. Warp
			thirteen.
			Wil, don't leave! We have to stay
			here -- find the cause of the
			temporal anomaly...
			Captain, we can't stay...
			We have to! Everything depends on
			this! We can't leave now --
			please listen to me!
			Jean-Luc.
			I'll be right back, Alissa.
			Alissa lost the baby.
			I think it's the same thing that
			happened to Geordi. Somehow, the
			temporal energy from the anomaly
			caused the fetal tissue to revert
			to an earlier stage of
			development. It was as if the
			unborn child began to... grow
			younger... until finally the DNA
			itself began to break down.
			How is she?
			Physically, she's fine. For now.
			But if this temporal reversion
			continues, I don't think any of us
			are going to be fine for much
			longer.
			So this is affecting the entire
			crew...
			Our cellular structures appear to
			be coalescing... reverting to
			earlier structures.
			In some cases, this has caused old
			injuries to be healed... but
			that's only a temporary effect.
			Eventually, this could kill us
			all.
			We also have to find out how
			widespread this effect is.
			Send an inquiry to Starbase Twenty-three
			-- they're the nearest
			outpost -- have them begin
			checking their personnel for any
			signs of temporal reversion.
			Aye, sir.
			Mister Data, how long until we've
			completed the tachyon scan?
			Approximately one hour, forty-five
			minutes.
			Good. Once it's completed, I want
			you to find a way to dissipate the
			anomaly without making things
			worse. Give me a risk analysis on
			whatever solution you come up
			with.
			Aye, sir.
			Dismissed.
			That's a pretty big decision, Jean-Luc...
			Tinkering with an anomaly you know
			nothing about... trying to
			collapse it... isn't that risky?
			Why? Will that cause the
			destruction of mankind?
			Maybe...
			On the other hand, maybe leaving
			it alone would be the wrong thing
			to do...
			It's a big decision, all right...
			Perhaps it would help to get a
			different perspective...
			Welcome home.
			Home?
			Don't you recognize your old
			stomping grounds? This is Earth --
			France. About... oh... three and
			a half billion years ago. Give or
			take an eon or two.
			Smells awful, doesn't it... all
			that sulfur and volcanic ash... I
			really must speak to the maid.
			Is there a point to all this?
			Look --
			The anomaly is here, at Earth... ?
			At this point in history, the
			anomaly has filled this entire
			quadrant of your galaxy.
			The further back in time... the
			larger the anomaly.
			oh, oh -- come here, there's
			something I want to show you!
			See this? This is you.
			I'm serious. Right here, life is
			about to form on this planet for
			the very first time. A group of
			amino acids is about to combine
			and form the first protein.
			The building blocks of what you
			call "life".
			Strange, isn't it, Jean-Luc?
			Everything you know... your entire
			civilization... it all begins
			right here in this little pond of
			goo. It's appropriate somehow,
			isn't it?
			Too bad you didn't bring a
			microscope -- this is quite
			fascinating.
			Here they go... the amino acids
			are moving closer... closer...
			closer...
			Ohhhh! Nothing happened!
			You see what you've done?
			You mean I caused the anomaly...
			and the anomaly... in some way...
			disrupted the beginning of life on
			Earth.
			Congratulations.
			Captain, I've just spoken to
			Doctor Selar... she said that
			twenty-three children on board
			have contracted some kind of
			illness. Their tissues appear to
			be... reverting to an earlier
			stage of development.
			She thinks it has something to do
			with the anomaly.
			Inform Starfleet Command that we
			believe the anomaly has toxic
			effects. Tell them I'm ordering
			the Terrellian ships back to
			Federation territory, but that
			we're staying here.
			We are?
			Yes. We have to find a way to
			collapse this anomaly.
			Counselor, prepare to evacuate all
			civilians and non-essential
			personnel to the Terrellians
			ships.
			Aye, sir.
			Data, O'Brien, you're with me.
			Let's concentrate on how this
			anomaly was initially formed.
			Speculation?
			Temporal ruptures in the spacetime
			continuum are rarely a naturally
			occurring phenomenon. It is
			therefore most likely that this
			anomaly was caused by an outside
			catalyst.
			Like a warp core explosion...
			I think I can rule out a warp core
			explosion.
			Our tachyon pulse has been unable
			to penetrate the anomaly
			completely. If we had information
			about the center of the
			phenomenon, we might have a basis
			for speculation.
			Can you find a way to scan the
			interior?
			I've tried everything I know of...
			there's just too much
			interference. There's nothing on
			board that'll do the job.
			Do you know what could?
			In theory, a tomographic imaging
			scanner capable of multiphasic
			resolution would be able to
			penetrate this much interference.
			The Daystrom Institute has been
			working on such a device, but it
			is still only theoretical.
			Data... do we have a tomographic
			imaging scanner on board?
			Yes, sir.
			Can you use it to scan the
			interior of the anomaly?
			Possibly.
			There is a great deal of
			interference... but I am getting
			some readings.
			This is very unusual...
			What is it?
			It appears that our tachyon pulse
			is converging with two other
			tachyon pulses at the center of
			the anomaly. The other two pulses
			have the exact same amplitude
			modulation as our own pulse. It
			is as if all three originated from
			the Enterprise.
			Three pulses... from three time
			periods... all converging at one
			point in space.
			Captain, what are you suggesting?
			Computer, where's Admiral Riker?
			Admiral Riker is in Ten Forward.
			The ship has held up pretty well
			over the years.
			They were going to decommission
			her about five years ago... but
			one nice thing about being an
			Admiral is getting to choose your
			own ship.
			Wil... how long is this thing
			between you and Worf going to go
			on?
			It's been going on for twenty
			years now... doesn't look like
			it's going to end any time soon.
			I suspect the last thing Counselor
			Troi would have wanted is for the
			two of you to be alienated.
			I agree. It's time to put this
			behind you.
			I tried -- at Deanna's funeral.
			He wouldn't talk to me.
			Might have been tough for him
			then... he took her death pretty
			hard.
			Yeah, well... he wasn't the only
			one.
			I know. But in his mind... you
			were the reason he and Deanna
			never got together.
			I didn't do anything to stand in
			his way --
			Didn't you, Wil?
			Did I?
			I just... never could admit it was
			over. I kept thinking one day
			we'd get together again... and
			then... she was gone.
			You think you've got all the time
			in the world, until...
			Yeah.
			Ensign. How... do I get to Ten
			Forward?
			Two decks up, sir. Section zero
			zero five.
			Thank you.
			Oh, my god.
			Wil! I know what's happening...
			I know what causes the anomaly...
			we have to go back!
			Jean-Luc... the only place you're
			going back to is bed.
			Damnit Wil, I know what's
			happening. We're causing the
			anomaly... with a... with the
			tachyon pulse... it happened in
			all three time periods. We do it
			in all three time periods!
			Jean-Luc, you better come with me.
			Leave me alone! I'm not crazy.
			The tachyon pulses... they -- they
			were used in the same spot -- in
			all three time periods... don't
			you see? When the tachyon pulse
			used the -- I mean, when the
			Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, we
			set the -- you know -- we...
			started everything... we set it
			in motion.
			It's like... the chicken and the
			egg! You think it started back
			then... but it didn't... it
			started here in the future...
			that's why it gets larger in the
			past...
			I think I understand what the
			Captain is saying. If I'm not
			mistaken, he is describing a
			paradox.
			Yes! Yes, exactly!
			Intriguing... it is possible we
			could've created the very anomaly
			we have been looking for.
			Let us assume for the moment, that
			the Captain has indeed been
			travelling through time. Let us
			also assume he has initiated an
			inverse tachyon pulse at the same
			coordinates in space in all three
			time periods.
			In that case, it is possible that
			the convergence of three tachyon
			pulses could've ruptured the
			subspace barrier and caused an
			anti-time reaction.
			I see where you're going. And
			because anti-time operates in the
			opposite way normal time does, the
			effects would run backwards
			through the spacetime continuum.
			Yes! That's why the anomaly was
			larger in the past. It was
			growing as it travelled backward
			through time.
			All right... let's say for the
			moment, you're right. What do we
			do about it?
			Go back. Go back to the Devron
			System.
			He may be right. If we return to
			the Devron System now, we might
			see the initial formation of the
			anomaly.
			Riker to Bridge. Set course for
			the Devron System. Maximum warp.
			Aye, sir.
			Worf... we could use a hand.
			Entering the Devron System, sir.
			All stop.
			Sensors are picking up a small
			temporal anomaly off the port bow.
			On screen.
			I was right...
			It's an anti-time eruption. It
			seems to have formed in the last
			six hours.
			We've got to stop it here... so it
			won't be able to travel back
			through time...
			All right, Data -- we need a
			solution and we need it fast.
			The anomaly is being sustained by
			the continuing tachyon pulses from
			the other two time periods. I
			suggest they be shut down.
			The next time I'm there, that's
			the first thing I'll do.
			Isn't there more we can do here...
			seal the rupture somehow?
			I am investigating the options.
			Data, disengage the tachyon pulse.
			Sir?
			Just do it. The convergence of
			tachyon pulses from the three time
			periods is what causes the
			anomaly.
			Aye, sir.
			Report. Is there any change in
			the anomaly?
			No, sir.
			Disengage the tachyon pulse.
			We haven't finished the scan, sir.
			I know that. But it's imperative
			that you disengage it immediately.
			Aye, sir. Disengaging.
			Why isn't the anomaly affected?
			Why would it be, sir?
			I've shut off the tachyon pulses
			in the other time periods -- but
			the anomaly didn't change.
			It remains unaffected here as
			well.
			What do we do?
			The only way to stop this thing is
			to repair the rupture at the focal
			point where time and anti-time are
			converging.
			How do we do that?
			It would require taking the ship
			into the anomaly itself. Once
			inside, we may be able to use our
			engines to create a static warp
			shell.
			Yeah, yeah... and the shell would
			act like an artificial subspace
			barrier -- separating time and
			anti-time...
			Collapsing the anomaly and
			restoring the normal flow of time.
			But this would have to be done in
			the other two time periods, as
			well.
			That could be a problem... the
			anomaly's so much larger in the
			other time periods...
			... It could be dangerous to take
			the ship in.
			Take the ship in where, sir?
			Into the anomaly, Chief. Lay in
			a course to the exact center.
			Transfer all available power to
			the shields.
			Sir... can you give us some
			explanation?
			No. I cannot.
			Captain, so far we've obeyed every
			order -- no matter how far-fetched
			it might have seemed. But if
			we're to risk the safety of the
			ship and crew... I think we have
			to ask you for an explanation.
			I know all of you have doubts
			about me... about each other...
			about the ship. All I can say is
			that even though we've only been
			together for a short time... I
			know that you are the finest crew
			in the fleet... and I would trust
			each of you with my life.
			I'm asking you to make a leap of
			faith -- and trust me.
			Shields up, maximum strength.
			Boosting field integrity on the
			warp nacelles. We may encounter
			shearing forces once we enter the
			anomaly.
			I am preparing to initiate a
			static warp shell.
			Course laid in, sir.
			All decks report ready, Captain.
			Chief... take us in.
			Captain, I have an idea. If we
			take the ship to the center of the
			anomaly and create a static warp
			shell...
			... a static warp shell, it could
			repair the barrier and collapse
			the anomaly.
			Yes, sir.
			Mister Data, you're a clever man --
			in any time period.
			Lay in a course to the center of
			the anomaly. Prepare to initiate
			a static warp shell.
			The other two Enterprises...
			they're on their way.
			Very well.
			Ensign... take us in.
			We're entering the anomaly, sir.
			All hands brace for impact!
			The temporal energy's interfering
			with main power. Switching to...
			... auxiliary power. I'm having
			trouble keeping the impulse
			engines on-line! I've got power
			fluctuations all across the board!
			Maintain course and speed!
			Mister Data, how long until we
			reach the center?
			Another thirty seconds at least,
			Captain.
			We've entered the anomaly.
			We have reached the center, sir.
			Initiate warp shell!
			Initiating static warp shell --
			now.
			Is it having any effect?
			Something is happening... A new
			subspace barrier appears to be
			forming --
			Captain! Sensors are picking
			up... two other ships...
			Captain, It appears to be working.
			The anomaly is beginning to
			collapse. I think that --
			Sir -- the temporal energy is
			rupturing our warp containment
			system!
			We must eject the core!
			No. We have to maintain the
			static warp shell for as long as
			possible!
			We're losing containment! I can't
			stop it, it's going to --
			Transfer emergency power to the
			anti-matter containment system!
			I'm trying, sir... but there's a
			lot of interference...
			The warp shell is definitely
			having an effect, sir. The
			anomaly is collapsing --
			The containment system's going --
			I can't hold it --
			Maintain position! Mister La
			Forge --
			Both of the other ships have been
			destroyed.
			Two down... one to go.
			Data, report!
			The anomaly is nearly collapsed...
			We're losing containment...
			Goodbye, Jean-Luc. I'll miss you.
			You did have so much potential.
			But I guess... all good things
			must come to an end.
			Containment field at critical!
			I'm losing it --
			The Continuum didn't think you had
			it in you, Jean-Luc... but I knew
			you could.
			Are you saying it worked? We
			collapsed the anomaly?
			Is that all this meant to you?
			Just another spatial anomaly...
			just another day at the office?
			Q, did it work?
			You're here, aren't you? You're
			talking to me, aren't you?
			What about my crew?
			"The anomaly... my crew... my
			ship." I suppose you're worried
			about your fish too. Well, if it
			puts your mind at ease, you've
			saved humanity once again.
			Thank you.
			For what?
			You had a hand in helping me get
			out of this.
			I was the one who got you into it,
			Jean-Luc. That was the directive
			from the Continuum.
			The part about the helping hand...
			was my idea.
			I sincerely hope this is the last
			time I'll find myself here.
			You just don't get it, do you,
			Jean-Luc?
			The trial never ends.
			We wanted to see if you had the
			ability to expand your mind and
			your horizons... and for one brief
			moment, you did.
			When I realized the paradox...
			Exactly. For that one fraction of
			a second, you were open to options
			you'd never considered. That's
			the exploration that awaits you...
			not mapping stars and studying
			nebulae... but charting the
			unknowable possibilities of
			existence.
			What are you trying to tell me, Q?
			You'll find out.
			In any case, I'll be watching...
			and if you're lucky, I'll drop by
			to say hello from time to time.
			See you out there.
			Captain, are you all right?
			Worf... what's the date?
			Stardate 47988.
			Is something wrong, sir?
			No, no... in fact, I think I'll go
			back to bed. I could use some
			sleep.
			Captain's Log, supplemental.
			Starfleet Command reports no
			unusual activity along the Neutral
			Zone, and there is no sign of a
			temporal anomaly. It would appear
			that I am the only member of the
			crew to retain any knowledge of
			the events I experienced.
			That's it for me.
			There's always next time.
			That's four hands in a row. How
			does he do it?
			I cheat.
			I'm kidding.
			I've been thinking... about all
			the things the Captain told us
			about the future. The way we
			changed and drifted apart... why
			would he tell us what's to come?
			It sure goes against everything
			we've heard about not polluting
			the time line...
			I believe, however, that this
			situation is unique.
			Since the temporal anomaly did not
			occur, there have already been
			changes in the way this time line
			is unfolding. The future we
			experience will undoubtedly be
			different from the one the Captain
			encountered.
			Maybe that's why he told us.
			Knowing what that future could
			bring... gives us a chance to
			change things now.
			So that some things never happen.
			Come in.
			Am I too late?
			Not at all. Have a seat.
			What's the game?
			Five card draw, deuces wild.
			Come.
			Captain. Is there a problem?
			No. I just thought I might...
			join you this evening. If there's
			room...
			Of course.
			Would you care to deal?
			Oh... thank you.
			I should have done this a long
			time ago. I was quite a card
			player in my youth, you know.
			You were always welcome.
			So. Five card stud, nothing wild.
			The sky's the limit.
