			Geordi... Have you found it yet?
			Not yet...
			Starting to get fumes... Ammonia,
			fluorine, potassium cyanide...
			I can feel the heat from here.
			There it is!
			How far?
			About ten meters. Along the ODN
			line. It's hot -- over two
			thousand degrees.
			I'm going in.
			Geordi, wait.
			We're okay... I've activated the
			emergency supression system.
			It's under control.
			All his vital functions are
			completely normal.
			The interface unit is operating
			within expected parameters.
			Why did he start coughing when he
			went through the gasses?
			Psychosomatic response.
			I feel like I'm actually here...
			I mean there -- in the Jefferies
			tube. I saw the smoke and I
			couldn't help coughing.
			No one else has reported so
			complete a sensory experience.
			The interface is perfect for
			Geordi because his VISOR inputs
			allow the probe to transmit
			information directly into his
			cerebral cortex.
			It looks like this is going to
			work. Let's get the probe out of
			the Jefferies tube and into the
			launch bay before we reach Marijne
			Seven.
			Will do...
			Something's wrong. I'm having
			trouble controlling my left leg.
			What is it?
			The probe is designed to respond
			to the movements Geordi intends to
			make -- when his brain sends a
			message to move his leg, the
			interface moves the probe instead.
			Apparently the gain on the tactile
			sensors is too low; I will
			increase the input.
			There it goes.
			I'm on my way down.
			Why the body-suit?
			It provides tactile sensations so
			that Geordi will feel as if he is
			in the same environment as the
			probe.
			What's wrong?
			Nothing...
			I just saw my reflection in a
			panel.
			I forgot what a handsome guy I am.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47215.5.
			We are responding to a distress
			call from the science vessel
			Raman, which is apparently trapped
			inside the turbulent atmosphere of
			an unusual gas giant planet. We
			will use an experimental interface
			probe in our attempt to rescue it.
			I have reviewed the vessel's
			mission plans. The Raman was to
			descend to the lower atmosphere,
			eleven thousand kilometers below
			its current position...
			The crew was to sample the
			atmosphere at that level, and then
			return to a safer orbit.
			Something must have happened down
			there. Maybe the shields failed,
			or they had an inversion reaction
			in the nacelles.
			Any life signs?
			Our bio-sensors are useless --
			there's too much interference in
			the atmosphere.
			The crew might still be alive.
			But we'll never be able to tell
			from up here.
			Will the probe be able to transmit
			through the interference?
			The probe sends information via a
			focused particle beam that should
			be able to cut through the
			interference.
			But we may have to operate the
			interface at near tolerance
			levels.
			Will your nervous system be able
			to handle that much sensory input?
			We've tested the interface at up
			to seventy percent of tolerance.
			There shouldn't be a problem going
			higher -- the safety override will
			kick in at ninety-eight percent
			tolerance and disengage the
			interface.
			Captain, I am receiving a
			transmission from Starfleet
			Command -- Admiral Holt.
			In my Ready Room.
			The seven people on that ship are
			our first priority. Is the probe
			ready for launch?
			Yes, Sir.
			Send it directly to the aft
			section of the Raman, through the
			secondary air lock. That'll put
			it one bulkhead away from the
			Bridge.
			I'll interface with the probe as
			soon as it's in place and take it
			in the rest of the way.
			Make it so.
			Onscreen.
			Hello, Marcus.
			Jean-Luc.
			How's life on DS-Three?
			We're hosting this year's palio.
			The Ferengi have already been
			accused of trying to bribe the
			Breen pilot into throwing the
			race...
			Nothing unusual about that.
			Nothing at all...
			I wish I could say I was just
			calling to catch up on things.
			Nine days ago, the Hera left here
			on a routine courier mission. We
			were in contact with them for five
			of those days. Then the ship
			disappeared without a trace.
			The Hera?
			I'm afraid so.
			The Excelsior and the Noble have
			spent the last seventy-two hours
			retracing its course. Nothing.
			I'm going to keep them at it for
			seventy-two more.
			But to be honest, I don't think
			another week would make any
			difference.
			I'll tell Commander La Forge...
			Mister Data, I need a word with
			Commander La Forge.
			Yes, Sir.
			I will be on the Bridge.
			I've just spoken to Starfleet.
			The Hera is missing.
			Missing... ?
			What about my mother... ?
			Captain La Forge has disappeared
			along with the rest of her crew...
			-- I saw your father last week and
			your sister about ten days before
			that. I decided I missed my
			favorite son...
			Your only son, Mom...
			You're going to have to see the
			Hera again. We've got a lot of
			new faces on board. Including a
			chief engineer who juices up the
			nacelles every chance she gets.
			I think she's the best technician
			in the fleet.
			Okay, second best.
			Come in...
			I didn't mean to interrupt.
			Don't worry about it.
			Maybe you should meet her. We're
			going to be in the same sector
			next week. Take a shuttle over
			and I'll introduce you.
			Mom's always trying to find me a
			wife.
			But if you're too busy, I'll see
			you at your father's birthday
			party. Remember, if you talk to
			him -- it's a surprise.
			This came in about three weeks
			ago.
			I never got back to her...
			Geordi, the probe has entered the
			planet's atmosphere. I'm ready to
			move it inside the ship.
			If you want to take a couple of
			days off, I'll run the interface.
			The interface is calibrated
			specifically for my VISOR inputs.
			You'd need at least ten hours to
			convert it. Those crewmen down
			there can't wait...
			The interface doesn't have to be
			fully compatible. I could use it
			right now. I wouldn't have the
			control you'd have, but it would
			still work.
			Forget it. I'm the best one for
			the job, and there's no reason not
			to go ahead as planned.
			The Hera is reason enough.
			The Hera is missing. That's all.
			Until I hear something more, my
			mother might just as well have
			taken the crew on an unscheduled
			holiday.
			Let's go.
			Sir, the probe is through the
			airlock and in position aboard the
			Raman.
			Picard to Commander Data. Report.
			We are ready to bring the
			interface on line.
			Proceed.
			Activating the remote sensors...
			Initiating interface... now.
			Vital signs normal... How do you
			feel, Geordi?
			Fine...
			Do you have visual contact?
			Not yet...
			Increase the input signal, Data.
			I'm not seeing anything...
			Acknowledged.
			I can see. But no colors.
			Increasing signal strength of
			seventy-five percent of tolerance.
			That's better.
			Your pulse has gone up...
			It might take your nervous system
			a little while to get used to this
			input level.
			I'm excited, that's all. This is
			like being on a roller coaster.
			Or a first date... Everything's
			okay.
			I'll be the judge of that, Geordi.
			If your heart rate goes too high,
			we'll disconnect you.
			Understood. But don't pull the
			plug yet...
			It's a mess in here. There must
			be a hull breach somewhere. I'm
			picking up atmospheric gasses
			inside the corridor -- methane and
			ammonia primarily.
			I'm heading toward the Bridge.
			It's getting worse the closer I
			get. The break in the hull might
			be on the Bridge itself.
			I found somebody!
			What is your position?
			About twelve meters up the main
			corridor! A section of the
			bulkhead collapsed on top of him.
			I can't move it. I need more
			power to the tractor beams.
			Go to eighty percent of tolerance --
			no higher.
			He looks pretty bad.
			He's dead.
			Data, the door halfway down the
			left corridor... what's it lead
			to?
			A magnetic storage bay.
			If there was a breach on the
			Bridge, that would be the safest
			place to go.
			Data, I need a phaser burst. Wide
			focus, level four intensity.
			I've found them!
			They're dead... all of them.
			There's a fire in here...
			Data! Disconnect him!
			What happened?
			I don't know... My hands...
			They're burned...
			How did this happen?
			There was some kind of energy
			discharge in the interface suit.
			Shouldn't the safety over-rides
			have prevented that?
			Yes... but I have a theory why
			they didn't.
			The tolerance levels on the
			interface were set extremely high.
			I think Geordi's neural response
			to the input was so strong that it
			created a feedback loop.
			The sensors that were transmitting
			the sensation of heat to my hands
			must've overloaded.
			I know it seems hard to believe,
			but the probe was sending huge
			amounts of sensory data directly
			into Geordi's brain. The
			tolerance levels on the interface
			were set extremely high.
			The Raman's crew is dead. I'd
			like to retrieve their vessel, but
			not if it means risking Geordi's
			safety.
			If we turn down the sensory input
			from the probe, I should be fine.
			Seven people lost their lives down
			there... we should at least
			retrieve the data they were
			collecting. Otherwise their
			deaths won't have any meaning.
			Doctor?
			If we operate the interface at
			lower input levels, I'd say the
			risk is acceptable.
			Alright.
			Picard to Riker.
			Riker, here.
			The Raman's crew is dead. I'd
			like to retrieve their vessel, but
			not if it means risking Geordi's
			safety.
			If we turn down the sensory input
			from the probe, I should be fine.
			Seven people lost their lives down
			there... we should at least
			retrieve the data they were
			collecting.
			Doctor?
			If we operate the interface at
			lower input levels, I'd say the
			risk is acceptable.
			Alright.
			Picard to Riker.
			Riker, here.
			I've decided to proceed with the
			probe.
			We'll have to take it into the
			Raman's auxiliary control room --
			the Bridge is too badly damaged.
			How long before you can get it
			into position?
			A few hours -- we're going to have
			to cut through a bulkhead.
			Acknowledged.
			Looks like you'll have some time
			to recuperate.
			There's something I need to do
			anyway.
			How are you, Dad?
			As well as expected, given the
			circumstances. Are you okay?
			Yeah...
			I talked to your sister this
			morning. She said she'd get in
			touch with you in a few days.
			Right now she's pretty upset.
			The service for the Hera will
			probably be on Vulcan -- most of
			the crew was from there. But your
			sister and I want to have a
			private ceremony --
			-- Dad. Don't you think
			everybody's jumping the gun here?
			Last I heard, two starships were
			still out there looking. They've
			found no debris, no residual warp
			distortion --
			-- And no ship.
			Not yet. That doesn't mean they
			won't.
			Starfleet is considering the Hera
			lost. The search isn't much more
			than a formality at this point.
			Geordi, your mother's gone...
			You can think that if you want.
			But until I see some hard
			evidence, I'm not going to give up
			hope.
			All right, Geordi. Call me if you
			need anything...
			Come in.
			Hey, Data. Still working?
			No. I have completed the
			adjustments on the interface. I
			am now waiting for Commander Riker
			to finish moving the probe.
			Do you wish to be comforted?
			No... I was just passing by.
			Wondered what you were up to.
			I am using the time to catch up on
			my study of poetry.
			Data, there's nothing on the
			screen.
			That is not entirely correct.
			While it is true the display is
			currently blank, this emptiness
			has a poetic meaning. So it
			cannot be considered "nothing" as
			such.
			Says who?
			The ancient Doosodarians. Much of
			their poetry contained such
			"lacunae" or empty spaces. Often
			these pauses measured several days
			in length, during which poet and
			audience were encouraged to fully
			acknowledge the emptiness of the
			experience.
			I remember some lectures at
			Starfleet academy that seemed like
			that.
			Are you certain you do not wish to
			talk about your mother?
			Why do you ask that?
			You are no doubt feeling emotional
			distress as a result of her
			disappearance. Though you claimed
			to be "just passing by," that is
			most likely an excuse to start a
			conversation about this
			uncomfortable subject. Am I
			correct?
			Well, no. Sometimes "just passing
			by" means "just passing by."
			Then I apologize for my premature
			assumption.
			This particular poem has a lacuna
			of forty-seven minutes. You may
			experience the emptiness with me
			if you wish.
			Thanks...
			Data, maybe you gave up too fast.
			I do not understand.
			When I said "just passing by"
			means "just passing by" -- I
			didn't really mean it.
			My initial assumption was correct.
			You do wish to speak of your
			mother.
			Am I crazy to think she's still
			alive?
			Your sanity is not in question.
			However, your evaluation of the
			available information is...
			biased.
			She's the captain of a starship!
			She's gotten herself into and out
			of impossible situations before.
			Why should this be any different?
			Disappearances fitting the profile
			of the Hera have rarely ended with
			the safe recovery of ship and
			crew.
			That makes me feel better.
			I'm sorry, Data. I didn't mean to
			snap at you.
			I am not offended. You are upset
			and your reactions are not
			surprising.
			I guess I am a little... on edge.
			It's just that... If she really is
			dead...
			I don't know what I'm going to
			do...
			We're receiving the probe's
			telemetry.
			The input levels are currently at
			fifty-three percent of tolerance.
			That's too low, Data. I won't be
			able to do anything down there.
			I want to start with as wide a
			margin of safety as possible. We
			can adjust upward as needed.
			Ready?
			Go ahead.
			Initiating interface...
			I can't see anything.
			I am increasing input now...
			That's better... but I need
			more...
			Is this level sufficient?
			Geordi?
			Geordi, can you hear me?
			Mom...
			Mom, is it you?
			Is it you... ?
			I forgot! All you're seeing is a
			probe. Yes, it's me. I'm on the
			Enterprise. I'm interfaced with
			this probe.
			Geordi. Who are you talking to?
			What are you seeing?
			But is it really you?
			Yes, Geordi. It's me.
			How can it be... ? How is it
			possible --
			There's no time to explain. We
			have to go down...
			Down where?
			The surface.
			Geordi. Report.
			Hang on, Doctor...
			Why? Why do we have to go to the
			surface?
			We're dying.
			"We?" Your ship? The Hera is
			down there?
			Geordi, we're disconnecting you
			right now...
			No. Wait...
			We need your help. I need your
			help... Geordi...
			The cut-off has been automatically
			activated.
			He's in neural shock --
			The sensory overload didn't cause
			any permanent damage -- but I
			wouldn't want to expose his
			nervous system to that much
			stimulus again.
			Is there any indication of what
			caused the hallucination?
			His brain functions are normal --
			I told you, I wasn't
			hallucinating.
			Geordi, I have analyzed the
			probe's sensor logs -- there are
			no readings that would indicate
			the presence of a living human on
			board the Raman.
			She wasn't actually there. Her
			ship is on the surface.
			Then you believe you saw some kind
			of... transmission?
			Somehow she managed to contact me.
			We have no indication of a
			transmission of any kind.
			Maybe I'm the only one who could
			detect it -- because I was
			interfaced with the probe.
			The probe does allow Geordi to
			sense quantum fluctuations,
			subspace anomalies, and other
			phenomena not perceptible to other
			kinds of sensors.
			Granted. But why would he
			perceive his mother visually, as
			if she were standing in the room?
			I'm not sure... I do know that our
			brains aren't designed to process
			the kind of sensory information
			Geordi was getting. When the
			brain receives something it can't
			understand, it interprets the
			input as best it can -- sometimes
			as a sound or smell, sometimes
			visually.
			You see?
			Geordi, that doesn't mean you're
			mother was really communicating
			with you. I'm just trying to
			explain why you might've thought
			she was.
			I'm telling you, my mother's ship
			is trapped down there -- they need
			our help.
			The Hera's last reported location
			was over three hundred light years
			away. How could it have ended up
			here?
			If the Hera is on the surface, its
			hull could not possibly withstand
			the pressure of the atmosphere.
			Just let me go back so we can be
			sure.
			I don't recommend he use the
			interface again -- the sensory
			overload nearly killed him.
			I'll be all right.
			I'm sorry, Geordi. But I won't
			risk your life.
			Mister Data, find another way to
			salvage the Raman. I want to hear
			an alternate plan in two hours.
			Yes, Captain.
			In the meantime, I'd like you to
			talk with Counselor Troi. She's
			expecting you.
			Aye, Sir...
			What's your mother like, Geordi?
			Counselor, if you think I'm going
			to start talking about my
			childhood, you're way off.
			That's not what I asked.
			No, I guess not.
			She was --
			She is... brilliant, funny...
			really perceptive. She knows
			people. Knows what they're all
			about even before they open their
			mouths. She's always been like
			that. A good judge of character.
			When did you see her last?
			Seven months ago, when she first
			took command of the Hera. I went
			to a party she had for her crew...
			The Enterprise and the Hera were
			in the same sector three weeks
			ago. She wanted to see me. We
			were both pretty busy though...
			I guess I could have made the
			time. But I didn't think... I
			mean I just didn't think...
			You didn't think it would be your
			last chance to see her...
			You don't know that! None of us
			does!
			I'm going to suggest something.
			Call it a theory. Alright?
			Alright...
			You're very worried about the
			disappearance of your mother...
			and guilty over not seeing her
			when you had the chance. So
			you're unwilling even to consider
			that she might be dead. This need
			to believe she's alive is so
			strong, it manifested itself as a
			physical image.
			But she told me she's trapped on
			the planet! She's in danger! If
			this was some kind of wish
			fulfillment, don't you think I'd
			fantasize her being safe and
			sound?
			No. Because that would end the
			fantasy -- you'd know it wasn't
			true. The more involved and
			complicated and unending your
			story is, the longer you can
			believe your mother is still
			alive.
			That's your theory, Counselor.
			I've got a different one.
			I have been exploring the
			possibility of using a tractor
			beam to pull the Raman from the
			atmosphere. However, there is so
			much interference that it prevents
			a positive lock.
			If we could set up some sort of
			relay system...
			That is my conclusion as well,
			Commander. Two shuttlecraft,
			staggered between the Enterprise
			and the Raman, with their shields
			adjusted to refocus the tractor
			beam.
			Can we get those shuttles close
			enough without putting them in
			danger?
			Mister La Forge.
			I suppose so.
			Yes. As long as you keep them
			above the troposphere, they'll be
			alright.
			In that case --
			What about the Hera?
			We'll be leaving my mother and her
			crew stranded on the planet. We
			have to save them.
			Commander --
			-- I've been thinking about
			this...
			A few weeks ago I got a message
			from my mother. She said she had
			a new chief engineer who was
			always experimenting with the warp
			drive.
			Well, I've seen the Hera -- it
			uses trionic initiators in the
			warp coil. They have a history of
			strange side effects -- especially
			if you start playing around with
			them.
			There have been reports of warp
			bubbles and other subspace
			deformations.
			So what if that's what happened?
			Not a warp bubble, but a subspace
			funnel.
			Connecting two points through
			subspace.
			The Hera could have accidentally
			created a distortion that emptied
			out right here, on Marijne Seven.
			Why here?
			The Hera passed near this planet
			just ten days ago. There's a lot
			of subspace distortion in the
			atmosphere -- the ship might've
			picked up some residual traces
			that directed the funnel back
			here.
			And the Hera is still in one
			piece, down on the surface?
			Maybe it's surrounded by some kind
			of subspace field that's keeping
			it together. But who knows for
			how long?
			Do you have any evidence to
			support this... hypothesis?
			I did get some strange subspace
			readings when I was interfaced
			with the probe.
			Geordi, that could be anything.
			I talked to her. She asked me to
			take the Raman closer to the
			planet.
			Is any of this possible?
			Yes.
			There.
			However, I believe it is...
			unlikely.
			How unlikely?
			Nearly impossible, Sir.
			Proceed with the shuttle plan.
			Captain --
			-- Mister La Forge. Stay here for
			a moment.
			Geordi, I'm not unsympathetic
			about what you're going through.
			But I want you to consider my
			position as well.
			Yes, Sir.
			Your mother's disappearance...
			It's... a tragic thing...
			But I can't risk your safety on
			the basis of a dubious hypothesis.
			If there's even one chance in a
			million I'm right and she's
			alive...
			I'm sorry, Geordi. I've made my
			decision.
			I understand, Sir.
			I suspected you would decide to
			operate the interface alone.
			You did?
			I am familiar enough with your
			behavior patterns to predict
			certain... decisions.
			I guess you know me pretty well...
			You are disobeying the Captain.
			I can't just sit back and do
			nothing when my mother might be
			down on that planet.
			I can not allow you to endanger
			your well being.
			If we leave here without knowing
			for sure...
			I'll have to live with it for the
			rest of my life... wondering... if
			I left her to die... I couldn't
			take that, Data... I couldn't...
			That's why I have to do this.
			I could have you confined to
			quarters for the duration of the
			mission.
			If you want to do that to me,
			Data, then go ahead. Because
			nothing less is going to stop me
			from trying to save my mother.
			What are you doing?
			I will monitor the interface and
			attempt to keep you safe.
			I can not have you confined to
			quarters for something you have
			not yet done.
			Data, we could both end up in a
			lot of trouble for this.
			There is a high degree of
			probability that you are right.
			Thanks, Data.
			However, I have a request.
			What's that?
			I would ask you to consider the
			possibility that what you see is
			not real.
			I will. I promise.
			I am establishing the interface...
			Mom... ?
			Hello, Geordi...
			How did you get here?
			I'm not really with you, Geordi.
			I'm on my ship, on the surface.
			We were pulled into a warp funnel.
			That's just what I thought!
			How are we communicating?
			We found a way to send a subspace
			signal that could cut through the
			atmospheric interference.
			Geordi, are you seeing the image
			of your mother... ?
			Yes, and she just confirmed
			everything I've been saying.
			I am reading some unusual subspace
			energy in your vicinity -- similar
			to what the probe sensors recorded
			the first time you encountered
			your mother.
			That's how she's communicating
			with me. It's the only kind of
			signal they could send that would
			get through the interference.
			We need your help.
			I've been thinking about this --
			I'm going to take the Raman into
			a low stationary orbit and
			initiate an inverse warp cascade.
			Why?
			The subspace distortion from the
			cascade should reverse the warp
			funnel -- your ship will end up
			right where it started.
			Geordi, the atmosphere becomes
			increasingly turbulent the farther
			down you go -- you may not be able
			to bring the Raman close enough to
			the Hera before being destroyed.
			I have to try, Data.
			We're running out of time.
			Shields back on line... we're
			starting our descent...
			Thank god...
			Thank... god...
			That you're alive -- that I was
			right about all this.
			I can't wait to call Dad. He and
			Ariana had given up...
			We're going home...
			Eventually, yeah.
			Data -- everything's fading in and
			out.
			I'm losing the interface.
			The probe is descending out of
			range.
			You're going to have to turn up
			the input gain to maintain my
			connection.
			It is already at seventy-five
			percent of tolerance.
			You can take it all the way up to
			a hundred if you increase it
			slowly enough -- give my nervous
			system time to adapt.
			That is theoretically true. But
			even at this input level you have
			already experienced dangerous
			neural feedback.
			Data, there are over three hundred
			people on board the Hera. We're
			the only chance they've got.
			I will increase the gain
			incrementally as you descend.
			It's working.
			When we are ready to disconnect
			the interface, we must allow
			sufficient time to lower the input
			levels -- otherwise your nervous
			system would go into shock from
			the sudden drop in input.
			Once I initiate the warp cascade
			we can start dropping the gain.
			We'll be in sensor range of your
			ship within a few minutes.
			I'm sorry I didn't get over to see
			you a few weeks ago.
			You were... too busy with work.
			I'm sorry; it won't happen again.
			Captain, the Raman is descending
			toward the planet.
			Geordi...
			Geordi, we are now at ninety
			percent of tolerance.
			My calculations show that you will
			reach one hundred percent of
			tolerance before you are in range
			of the Hera.
			Then we're going to have to go
			beyond tolerance.
			That is not advisable. You must
			cease your descent.
			Geordi, don't stop... please.
			Data, I'm taking this ship down.
			If you don't boost the gain past
			tolerance levels, I'll lose the
			interface when we go out of range
			and my nervous system will go into
			shock.
			You are putting me in a very
			difficult position. Please cease
			your descent.
			I won't do it... so you'd better
			increase the tolerance...
			Disengaging safety systems...
			going to full tolerance levels...
			now.
			Thanks, Data.
			We're getting close...
			Thank god...
			La Forge.
			Yes, Captain?
			Stop your descent and prepare to
			disengage the interface.
			I'm sorry, sir. But I can't do
			that.
			Damn it, Geordi -- you're going to
			kill yourself...
			If I come back now, my mother and
			her entire crew will die.
			I'm scanning for your ship...
			I'm not getting anything.
			We're still too far away...
			Not really. I should be picking
			something up by now.
			I'm not finding anything... No
			warp funnel... No ship... There's
			nothing there.
			His neural synapses are
			overloading.
			He can't survive this...
			Geordi -- what's happening to you?
			Geordi!
			Reverse tractors -- Reverse --
			Reversing tractor beams...
			What are you?
			You are killing us... We must go
			down.
			Geordi... Report.
			You're trapped... ?
			Is there any way we can disconnect
			him?
			If we cut him off abruptly, he'll
			go into neural shock.
			How can we lower the input
			gradually and still get him out
			before it's too late?
			Perhaps we can deceive his neural
			receptors.
			Deceive them?
			By feeding them the sensory
			information recorded from his
			earlier experiences with the
			probe.
			We could disconnect the interface
			and still maintain the input
			levels.
			We could then lower them in a
			controlled manner.
			Like a decompression tank.
			Let's try it.
			Captain. I have to take the ship
			into the lower atmosphere...
			Explain.
			As I understand it... when the
			Raman got close to the planet,
			they accidentally picked up some
			lifeforms that live in the lower
			atmosphere. Subspace beings of
			some kind -- intelligent. When
			the ship went back into a higher
			orbit, the beings were trapped.
			How do you know all this?
			One of them is able to communicate
			with me. It must have read my
			thoughts through the probe
			interface and took the form of my
			Mother -- to try to talk me into
			taking the ship closer to the
			surface.
			Were these beings responsible for
			the death of the Raman's crew?
			Yes, but I don't think it was on
			purpose. They probably tried to
			communicate with them the same way
			they're communicating with me --
			by directly accessing their
			thoughts. That must've been fatal
			to the crew... I guess the
			interface protected me.
			I have to take them back -- they
			can't survive so far up in the
			atmosphere.
			I'll turn the ship around and come
			back as soon as we're --
			La Forge! What happened?
			The atmosphere is getting more
			turbulent. It's overloading the
			systems.
			I'm having trouble keeping the
			shields up.
			Geordi...
			We're safe now...
			Good bye...
			I'm losing power...
			Total shield failure in eight
			seconds...
			Are you ready to switch inputs?
			Almost.
			Shields are failing...
			Switching inputs!
			Is it working?
			His vital signs are stabilizing.
			He's going to make it.
			Captain's Log, supplemental. We
			have succeeded in disengaging
			Mister La Forge from the interface
			and are en route to Starbase four-nine-five.
			You disobeyed my direct order, and
			you put yourself in grave danger.
			I'm not happy.
			It's my fault, sir. Data was just --
			I'll deal with Data at another
			time. Meanwhile, I'll have to
			write this incident into your
			permanent record.
			Yes, sir.
			Geordi...
			I'm very sorry you didn't find
			your mother.
			Thank you, sir.
			When I was down there... it was so
			real. It's funny, but in a way...
			I feel like I got a chance to say
			goodbye...
			You're trapped?
			Caught on the ship...
			You killed the Raman's crew?
			What do you want?
