			Tell me... why is it so important
			that you find this man?
			We had some business dealings...
			he owes me money.
			If we had business dealings, I can
			tell you I wouldn't disappear...
			Maybe we should discuss that
			possibility. But first, I have to
			find him... collect the money I'm
			owed...
			Let me guess... you and your
			friend were smuggling relics from
			the ruins of Nafir...
			Mmmmmm...
			A dangerous game.
			Maybe I like danger.
			Then you've come to the right
			place.
			I'll be closing in a few hours.
			Perhaps we can discuss this...
			more privately.
			If I can't find him, I'll have to
			move on. Are you sure you haven't
			seen him?
			Human... two meters tall... smooth-headed...
			no, I don't remember
			anyone like that.
			You're lying...
			And you're Betazoid... I thought
			so.
			The people who come here count on
			a certain amount of... anonymity.
			If I started answering questions
			about them... even to a very
			beautiful woman... I wouldn't be
			in business very long.
			As a businesswoman, I'm sure you
			understand.
			Great story... I'll have to
			remember that the next time I'm in
			a knife fight...
			Any luck?
			I think the one over there knows
			something.
			He wouldn't admit to having seen
			the Captain... but he said that
			anyone who visited the ruins of
			Nafir would probably come here
			eventually... I suspect he knows
			more.
			Let's go.
			Commander -- I told him --
			My friend here tells me you might
			know about the man we're looking
			for.
			The only reason I'm talking to
			you... is that I have a sister,
			too.
			I explained to him... that we are
			looking for the man who
			impregnated your sister.
			You can imagine how much this
			means to me.
			Family honor is important... If
			someone had defiled my sister...
			I would do anything... pay
			anything... to find the one
			responsible.
			I see. And just how much would
			"anything" be?
			As much as... five bars of goldpress
			latinum.
			I think you've had too much to
			drink. You'd better leave.
			On your way, Yranac.
			I'm sorry... but I think he wants
			to stay.
			Sit down.
			This --
			-- is my sister.
			She's angry.
			She has a vicious temper. I
			wouldn't cross her.
			You talk and you're a dead man,
			Yranac.
			Perhaps there is an element of
			risk here that I did not fully
			appreciate.
			And how much more latinum will it
			take to offset that risk?
			This isn't about latinum.
			As a man with a sister -- a sister
			with a temper -- I can sympathize
			with you. But...
			How did you come here? Do you
			have a ship in orbit?
			Yes...
			Then take me with you. You can
			drop me anywhere you like.
			Agreed. Now talk.
			The man you're looking for was
			here several weeks ago. There was
			a group of aliens sitting at this
			table... he was asking them
			questions.
			Who were these aliens?
			I don't know. But they looked
			dangerous.
			They attacked him. He managed to
			incapacitate three of them before
			he was knocked down.
			He was thrown against that wall...
			and fell there.
			I'm picking up some Starfleet
			fiber traces... and human cellular
			debris.
			Can you establish a DNA sequence?
			There's something strange here.
			The cell structures are badly
			distorted. It looks as if they've
			been exposed to some kind of high
			energy field.
			A weapon discharge?
			It could be. There are faint
			traces of micro-crystalline damage
			in the floor material. But I'm
			not familiar with the pattern.
			Who are you people?
			You didn't say anything about a
			weapon.
			I hadn't finished yet. You'll
			like this... the man got what was
			coming to him. When they knocked
			him down, one of them took out a
			weapon... and fired.
			He was vaporized.
			He's telling the truth.
			Doctor?
			There's no question. It's Captain
			Picard's DNA.
			I used a multi-base progression to
			regenerate the DNA. The technique
			is practically flawless...
			The cellular damage could have
			been caused by a variety of energy
			fields... it's hard to be
			specific. I can't tell whether it
			was the field itself that killed
			him or if he was already dead
			when...
			I'll need your analysis for my
			report to Starfleet.
			It's all here.
			Thank you.
			I'll inform the crew.
			Come.
			How are you doing?
			I'm all right.
			The crew is pretty shaken up...
			I'm arranging a memorial
			service... I think you should be
			the one to deliver the eulogy.
			You'd be better at something like
			that. Or Beverly. She knew him
			the longest...
			I know it won't be easy... but
			it's important for all of us to
			face what's happened. You're in
			command now. The crew will be
			looking to you for guidance --
			You don't understand. I can't
			give the eulogy because I won't be
			at the service.
			A memorial service helps to give
			everyone a sense of completion.
			Helps them begin the healing
			process...
			That's exactly the point. I don't
			want to heal.
			Wil --
			I've got an open wound in here, it
			hurts like hell, and I don't want
			it to get better. I don't want to
			believe that everything's all
			right.
			You're angry...
			You're damn right. And I intend
			to stay angry -- until I find
			whoever's responsible for the
			Captain's death.
			That's pretty selfish, Wil.
			Do you think you're the only one
			in pain? That you have a monopoly
			on loss? Well, I've got news for
			you. We're all hurting... we're
			all angry. And like it or not,
			you've got a responsibility to the
			crew. You can't just indulge your
			personal desire for revenge.
			That's enough, Counselor.
			I'm sorry.
			Deanna. This isn't about revenge.
			It's about justice. The Captain
			died in a bar fight... for
			nothing. Somebody has to answer
			for that.
			Then I can mourn.
			Commander. We are receiving a
			transmission from Admiral Chekote
			at Starbase two-twenty-seven.
			Put it through to the Ready Room.
			Aye, sir.
			Sir.
			I've read your report, Commander.
			My condolences to you and your
			crew. Captain Picard's death is
			a loss to the entire Federation.
			I see you've asked to postpone
			your mission to the Argus
			sector... for what reason?
			I have a request, sir.
			I'd like to conduct an
			investigation into Captain
			Picard's death.
			The Dessican authorities have
			jurisdiction in this case,
			Commander.
			I know that, sir. But frankly, I
			don't have much confidence in the
			authorities on Dessica Two.
			There's every reason to believe
			they're corrupt.
			I suspect you're right. But the
			question remains... are you the
			one to pursue this?
			Sir, the Captain's death has hit
			me pretty hard. I may not be
			completely objective... but no one
			is more determined than I am.
			I won't quit until we find out
			who's responsible.
			All right, Commander. I'm
			officially placing the Enterprise
			on detached duty. Your mission is
			at your discretion. Good luck.
			Thank you, sir.
			Ah, Commander Riker. I've been
			meaning to speak to you. I was
			wondering if you could move me to
			better quarters. I don't care
			much for the decor here.
			These are the best quarters we
			have.
			Now that you've had some time to
			relax, I was hoping you might have
			remembered some details about the
			aliens you saw... something you'd
			forgotten earlier.
			Sorry. My memory isn't what it
			used to be.
			You said the aliens looked
			dangerous. How could you tell?
			They killed someone. I'd say that
			qualifies them as dangerous.
			But you said that you noticed they
			looked dangerous before the fight
			even started. What made you think
			that? Were they unusually
			aggressive... ? Were they heavily
			armed... ?
			I don't recall.
			They murdered a man in plain view
			of everyone in that bar... and you
			can't remember anything about
			them?
			Now that you mention it, I do
			remember one thing...
			They said they'd kill anyone who
			talked about what happened.
			But you offered to help us.
			You're right. I saw a business
			opportunity. And besides, they
			were gone.
			Do you know where they went?
			You know who they are and you know
			where I can find them.
			Perhaps I do.
			What do you want?
			Not a great deal, Commander. Just
			a shuttlecraft. I believe I'd
			like to travel for a while, see
			more of the galaxy. You
			understand.
			A shuttlecraft?
			Well, here's my offer. Instead of
			a ship, I'm going to give you some
			time.
			Time?
			If you're lucky, you'll only have
			to spend the next five years in
			prison instead of the next twenty.
			You've got twelve outstanding
			arrest warrants for fraud and
			petty theft in the Klingon Empire.
			If you tell me what you know, I'll
			pull a few strings... maybe get
			them to reduce your sentence after
			you're extradited.
			You can't turn me over to the
			Klingons. They don't just
			imprison you... Do you know what
			the punishment is for fraud?
			Yes. I certainly do.
			If I tell you what I know, you
			must promise you won't give me to
			the Klingons.
			I'll think about it.
			Perhaps you could send me to a
			Federation rehabilitation colony
			instead.
			Talk!
			The aliens were some kind of
			mercenary group. They've been
			operating in this sector for the
			last six months.
			Where do we find them?
			I heard one of them mention the
			Barradas system... I think they
			were headed there.
			You think?
			That's all I know.
			Riker to Data.
			Data here.
			Take us out of orbit. Set course
			for the Barradas system, warp six.
			Barradas Three is the only M-class
			planet in this system, and it is
			listed as unpopulated. However,
			sensors have detected intermittent
			energy signals emanating from its
			surface.
			What's the source?
			The signals are difficult to
			localize, but... they might be
			emissions from some kind of power
			converter...
			Which could indicate a base or a
			ship.
			What else do we know about
			Barradas Three?
			The planet was an outpost of the
			Debrune approximately two thousand
			years ago. The Federation
			Archaeological survey has
			catalogued numerous ruins on the
			surface.
			Mister Worf, I want a security
			detail to accompany the Away Team
			to the surface. I'll lead the
			team. Geordi, you're with me...
			Mister Data, you have the Bridge.
			Aye, sir.
			Sir.
			As Acting First Officer, I must
			question your decision to
			accompany the Away Team. If
			Captain Picard were here --
			He's not.
			I realize that, sir. But if he
			were, and he wanted to lead an
			Away Team, you would tell him that
			the Captain's place is --
			On the Bridge. I know.
			But not this time.
			It's tough to get accurate sensor
			readings... there's a lot of
			interference in the area.
			From what?
			I'm not sure... it's unlocalized.
			It could be atmospheric...
			What do you make of this?
			The ruins are ancient... but I'd
			say this indentation was made
			fairly recently...
			There might have been a battle
			here...
			It doesn't look like any blast
			point I've ever seen... the shape
			is too perfect.
			Sir, there's micro-crystalline
			damage all through this area.
			It's the same kind of pattern
			Doctor Crusher picked up in the
			floor of that bar on Dessica Two.
			Commander...
			I have found something.
			It almost looks as if someone...
			dropped them --
			La Forge to Enterprise... we are
			under attack...
			Repeat, we are under attack...
			Commander, we've lost contact with
			the Away Team.
			Is there a malfunction?
			No, sir... the com system is being
			jammed...
			What is the source?
			Somewhere on the surface...
			Bridge to Transporter Room Two.
			Can you get a lock on the Away
			Team?
			Negative, sir. There's too much
			interference.
			I'm going to try to reach those
			trees. If I can get there, we
			might be able to set up a
			crossfire. Keep me covered...
			Data to Away Team... please
			respond...
			Data, we've been attacked. We've
			got one casualty... and Commander
			Riker has been taken captive.
			Sir, the mercenaries have
			transported away... they must have
			a base or a ship nearby. Can you
			locate anything on sensors?
			Commander, we're picking up a
			vessel leaving orbit...
			Why was it not detected earlier?
			They could have been using the
			planet as a shield...
			Sir, they are powering up their
			weapon systems.
			Raise shields. Red Alert.
			Damage report.
			Minor hit on the port deflector...
			no damage.
			They're running, sir... their
			speed is warp eight-point-seven
			and holding. I think they're at
			their maximum..
			Take us to warp nine and pursue.
			Lock phasers on target.
			Aye, sir... we should be within
			phaser range in twenty-three
			seconds.
			Switching to long-range
			scanners...
			Commander... the sensor image of
			that ship is extremely weak...
			it's fading...
			The ship doesn't register on the
			long range sensors. I'm sorry,
			sir... we've lost them.
			Increase the sensor field
			bandwidth. Patch in the lateral
			sensor arrays to enhance
			detection.
			It's no good... the signal's
			gone... it just... disappeared.
			Plot a course and take us back to
			Barradas Three. Notify the Away
			Team to be ready for transport.
			Starfleet Intelligence has
			confirmed that a ship matching
			this configuration has been linked
			to raids on several other planets
			in this sector.
			For the short time it was within
			our visual range, we were able to
			take sensor readings of the
			mercenary vessel.
			It appears to be encased in an
			energy-absorbing material.
			Although we can see the ship, this
			energy sheath renders it virtually
			undetectable to our long-range
			sensors.
			There must be some way to track
			it.
			Data, I know this is a long
			shot... but if I remodulate the
			long-range sensor array, I might
			be able to increase its
			sensitivity enough to detect the
			ship.
			Without a full compositional
			analysis of the energy sheath, the
			chances of finding the correct
			remodulation sequence are remote.
			Furthermore, based on their speed,
			they could be as far as two-point-three-seven
			light years from this
			location.
			That means they must still be
			within this sector. If we used
			all available shuttlecraft to
			conduct a level-one search --
			It would still take at least ten
			days to complete. In that time
			the mercenaries would continue to
			distance themselves from us.
			Sir. They have taken Commander
			Riker. We must do something. We
			cannot just sit here.
			On the contrary, Lieutenant, that
			is precisely what we must do.
			Since there are no viable
			alternatives, we will return to
			the surface and attempt to
			determine what the mercenaries
			were doing on this planet. An
			investigation may reveal some
			indication of their purpose.
			Notify me when you have assembled
			your search teams.
			Dismissed.
			I warned you not to push the
			engines so hard. Two of the power
			shunts are on the verge of
			collapse. We'll be lucky if we
			can maintain warp six.
			How long will it take to repair?
			I can try to realign the warp
			core... it'll take at least
			eleven hours.
			But I'll have to shut the engines
			down completely.
			We're not stopping. We can't
			afford to be sitting helpless in
			space. I want warp eight
			available in five hours. And I'm
			not going to listen to your
			excuses.
			What were you doing on Barradas
			Three?
			William T. Riker, Commander, SC
			two-three-one dash four-two-seven.
			All right. I am Arctus Baran...
			and I don't have a number.
			Now. What were you doing on
			Barradas Three -- Commander?
			We were studying the ruins. It
			was a scientific expedition.
			Don't patronize me. Those ruins
			have been studied for centuries.
			There's nothing new to learn from
			them.
			Then what were you doing there?
			Don't bother, Commander, you can't
			remove it. It's a neural servo.
			It's connected directly to your
			nervous system.
			It lets me control precisely how
			much pain you feel.
			This setting is usually
			sufficient.
			However, if necessary it can go
			much higher.
			These devices were my
			predecessor's idea... a convenient
			way of enforcing discipline...
			What happened to him?
			He failed to discipline me
			sufficiently...
			This is a waste of time, Baran.
			Get rid of him now.
			You should be more patient, Vekor.
			It can be rewarding.
			We will wait. Let the memory of
			his pain argue with him for a
			while... maybe it will change his
			attitude.
			Vekor's right -- we should get rid
			of him. It's dangerous to have
			someone from Starfleet on board.
			Dangerous? It might be
			profitable. A Starfleet Commander
			is a valuable hostage.
			Starfleet won't negotiate with us.
			But they'll pursue us as long as
			we have him.
			This discussion is over, Vekor.
			Return to your post.
			They're right, Baran, and you know
			it...
			I say kill him. Now.
			If he has nothing to give us, then
			we should kill him now and be done
			with it. Everyone seems to
			recognize that fact except you.
			I don't need a consensus to run
			this ship, Galen.
			What's going on?
			We're bypassing the aft plasma
			couplings... the power loss should
			only last a few seconds...
			You should learn not to limit your
			options. Riker could be useful to
			us in the future.
			He may not be as useful as you
			think...
			... if this is the same Riker I've
			heard about.
			And which "Riker" is that?
			Commander of the Enterprise... ?
			Formerly assigned to the USS
			Hood... ?
			That's right.
			Then you must be the William T.
			Riker with a history of
			insubordination...
			He was even relieved of duty once,
			during the Cardassian incident at
			Minos Korva.
			How do you know all this?
			I've been smuggling artifacts out
			of Federation sites for years.
			It's difficult to avoid developing
			a... familiarity with certain
			Starfleet personnel...
			If we hadn't captured him, he
			probably would've ended up in
			front of a court martial.
			I've gotten out of them before.
			He's no use to us. Finish him now
			or let me do it for you.
			Watch him.
			What have you done?
			It has nothing to do with my
			repairs...
			I think there's a malfunction in
			the engine's intermix chamber...
			We're accelerating...
			Plasma pressure is rising...
			Where's the malfunction?
			It could be any one of thirty
			subsystems. It'll take time to
			locate...
			I don't think you're going to have
			the chance. Plasma pressure is
			reaching critical levels...
			Seal off the intermix chamber.
			I can't... the override sequence
			won't engage...
			It's the antimatter flow
			regulator... It's locked open...
			Plasma pressure has exceeded
			maximum levels... eight percent
			above critical and rising.
			We have to jettison the core...
			No! We'll be stranded here --
			The flow regulator is frozen...
			Let me do it.
			I've had a lot of experience with
			these kinds of system failures...
			I might be able to do something.
			Plasma pressure is eleven percent
			above critical... The containment
			fields are beginning to degrade...
			Go!
			It looks like you've got a control
			logic lockout in the regulator
			subsystem.
			I'm going to try to run an active
			bypass through the plasma flow
			convertor...
			Start running a phase-locked
			feedback through the regulator...
			I'll need about a six second
			delay...
			I don't take orders from you.
			Do as he says!
			Plasma pressure is fourteen
			percent above critical...
			If you fail--
			We'll all be dead anyway.
			Just a few more seconds...
			Plasma pressure is dropping...
			We're back into safe levels.
			If you want to make sure that
			doesn't happen again, you'd better
			re-initialize the regulator
			subprocessors. A full diagnostic
			on the intermix chamber wouldn't
			hurt either.
			Do it.
			Put him in quarters for now.
			Still wish you'd killed me?
			The search teams have reported in,
			sir. They located several
			archaeological sites. Each one
			has been looted.
			It's possible that the micro-crystalline
			damage I found in
			these indentations was the result
			of some kind of high-energy
			Transporter beam...
			... but I still don't understand.
			There's nothing here that's
			particularly valuable. Why would
			anyone want to steal any of these
			things?
			Perhaps these artifacts have
			special value to the Romulans.
			The Romulans?
			These structures were built by the
			Debrune. That race was an ancient
			offshoot of the Romulans. And the
			ruins on the planet where Captain
			Picard was killed were also
			Romulan in origin.
			The leader of the group which
			attacked us was a Romulan.
			Perhaps they are controlling the
			mercenaries...
			But the question remains: Why are
			they stealing these artifacts?
			There are several archaeological
			sites in this sector containing
			ruins which are Romulan in origin.
			These are the locations which have
			been attacked by the mercenary
			vessel.
			It looks like they've done a
			pretty thorough job.
			The only sites which have not been
			attacked are on Calder Two,
			Yadalla Prime, and Draken Four.
			Yadalla and Draken are on the far
			edge of the sector... but Calder
			Two is less than a day from here
			at maxiumum warp.
			That would be their next likely
			target.
			According to this, there's a
			Federation outpost on Calder Two.
			But it is only a small science
			station; it has limited defensive
			capabilities.
			I do not believe it could
			withstand an attack by the
			mercenary ship.
			Mister Worf. Send a message to
			the Federation outpost on Calder
			Two. Advise them that if a ship
			matching the mercenary vessel's
			configuration approaches, they
			should attempt to delay them until
			our arrival.
			Ensign Giusti, take us out of
			orbit. Set course for the Calder
			system. Warp nine.
			Aye, sir.
			We don't have much time...
			I hardly expected to see you here,
			Wil.
			I was trying to find the people
			who killed you.
			A witness in that bar saw you
			vaporized.
			These mercenaries use weapons
			which activate their Transporter.
			It allows them to beam away
			objects quickly, by simply firing
			at them. That's what they did to
			me.
			I don't understand any of this.
			Who are these people? How did you
			get involved with them?
			One of the sites I wanted to study
			had been raided. A lot of
			artifacts were stolen... the site
			was practically destroyed. I
			wanted to find who was
			responsible.
			I tracked them to the bar on
			Dessica Two. I suppose I asked
			too many questions... They
			captured me to find out how much
			I knew about their operation...
			But you ended up as part of the
			crew...
			I convinced them I was a smuggler
			named "Galen", and I offered to
			help them appraise the relics
			they'd stolen...
			Wil, these aren't common thieves.
			They're stealing Romulan artifacts
			from archaeological sites
			throughout this sector...
			Baran has me analyzing each one
			for a particular particle
			signature. They're looking for a
			specific artifact...
			Why?
			That's what we have to find out.
			And Baran is the key. I believe
			he's the only one on board who
			really knows what we're looking
			for.
			I want you to try to get close to
			Baran... gain his confidence.
			That's why you set up the engine
			failure... you knew I'd be able to
			fix it...
			He also believes you're a less
			than perfect Starfleet officer...
			you'll have to play into that
			role.
			Baran doesn't care much for me --
			he tolerates me because he needs
			me to test the artifacts. If you
			and I become enemies, there's a
			better chance you can become his
			friend.
			All right. I'll do what I can --
			What are you doing here?
			Getting some answers. Just
			because you couldn't get him to
			talk --
			No one conducts an interrogation
			on this ship without my
			permission.
			Is that understood?
			Our next objective is located in
			the Sakethan burial mounds on
			Calder Two.
			Calder Two isn't just another
			archaeological site. There's a
			Federation outpost there.
			I don't see that as a problem.
			It's defended by Starfleet.
			They're not going to just stand by
			while we walk in and take whatever
			we want.
			I'm aware of the tactical
			situation.
			What are their defenses?
			Nothing to worry about. They have
			a type-four deflector shield
			protecting the outpost and the
			ruins.
			They'll also have a minimum of two
			phaser banks... and possibly even
			photon torpedoes. Is that enough
			to worry about?
			How do you know so much about this
			outpost?
			I tried to smuggle a Sakethan
			glyph stone out of there two years
			ago. I barely got away in one
			piece.
			Our weapons are more than a match
			for their defenses. I anticipate
			we'll be able to destroy the
			outpost in less than fifteen
			minutes. After that, we'll send
			in Tallera and the landing party
			to secure the relics.
			Fifteen minutes is more than
			enough time to transmit a distress
			call.
			By the time they're able to detect
			us, we'll be jamming their
			communications. They'll have no
			chance to send a message.
			But our sensors will be useless as
			well.
			Starfleet's already searching for
			this ship. They could be on top
			of us without our realizing it.
			He's right. And our landing party
			would be stranded on the surface.
			That's a risk I'm prepared to
			take.
			That's because you won't be down
			there... your life won't be at
			risk.
			If we don't find what we're
			looking for, none of our lives
			will be worth anything.
			Why? Who are we working for?
			All you need to know is that we
			have to attack that outpost. We
			don't have a choice.
			Maybe we do.
			Why don't we use Riker?
			A Starfleet Commander might be
			able to talk us past the outpost
			security without raising any
			suspicions.
			Once they drop their shields, we
			could beam the artifacts up
			without having to leave the ship.
			Why would Riker help us? Just
			because he's out of favor with
			Starfleet doesn't mean he's ready
			to betray them.
			If he doesn't help us, we'll
			destroy the outpost and kill
			everyone on it. He's still a
			Starfleet officer... he won't let
			innocent people die if he can
			prevent it.
			The last time we engaged
			Starfleet, we lost a man. We
			can't afford any more casualties.
			If we can avoid a battle, I think
			we should.
			All right. We'll try it.
			We'll be at Calder Two in
			approximately five hours... you
			all know your duties. I want this
			ship ready for battle...
			... in case your plan doesn't work.
			Computer. Access spectral
			enhancement mode three and begin
			scan.
			Scan complete.
			Analysis?
			Terikon particle decay profile
			does not fall within specified
			reference range. Probability of
			match: zero-point-zero-four
			percent.
			Computer. Reset diagnostic for
			new sample, lot number three-six-nine-A...
			Baran wants to see the analysis of
			the last lot. He thinks you're
			moving a little slowly.
			Tell Baran if he wants the
			analysis done faster, he can do it
			himself. If he wants it done
			correctly, he can wait.
			Do you enjoy living dangerously,
			Galen? Baran can kill you in an
			instant if he activates his
			control device...
			I doubt he'll do that. I've
			increased the accuracy of the
			identification process by a factor
			of ten. I'm the best person here
			to analyze these artifacts, and
			Baran knows it.
			Computer, begin scan.
			He may need you now -- but I know
			Baran, and I can tell you he's not
			going to back down forever.
			You accomplish nothing by
			provoking him.
			Scan complete.
			I don't like operating in the
			dark. If I knew what the point of
			this mission were... why I'm
			scanning these relics...
			If Baran felt it were wise to let
			the crew know that, I'm sure he
			would have.
			Do you know what this is all
			about?
			What Baran knows, I know...
			Then tell me what we're doing
			here. Why are we risking our
			lives taking these artifacts? Who
			wants them?
			I see no reason to tell you
			anything... but you can rest
			assured I don't necessarily share
			everything I know with Baran,
			either.
			This conversation, for example...
			will stay between us.
			You can tell him every word I've
			said. He knows I don't think he's
			much of a leader.
			He's been in charge of this crew
			for a long time.
			He wouldn't be captain for five
			minutes if he didn't have the
			control device.
			The crew follows him because they
			have no choice. Baran's power is
			based only on fear and
			intimidation.
			That almost sounds like a prelude
			to mutiny...
			If someone were to challenge Baran --
			the crew would follow.
			I was right. You do like living
			dangerously...
			I like you, Galen. I can tolerate
			a lot from someone like you... but
			only to a point.
			I intend to complete this mission
			successfully and get what's been
			promised me. If it looks as
			though you're getting in the way
			of that... I'll deal with you
			myself.
			Commander, no one is allowed on
			the surface without prior
			authorization from the Federation
			Science Council.
			I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but
			the outpost is in imminent danger
			of attack. I want to station
			security personnel on the surface
			to protect you.
			I am ordering you to drop your
			shields.
			I'm sorry, sir... but the
			regulations are very specific. I
			can't do it.
			If you like, you can remain in
			orbit until we contact the Science
			Council, but we're experiencing
			some communication difficulties
			right now, so it might take some
			time --
			They're delaying on purpose.
			Someone has warned them.
			Charge main disruptor array...
			destroy the outpost.
			That would take too long.
			Starfleet might be here any
			minute...
			What are you doing?
			I'm configuring the disruptors to
			fire a phase-resonant pulse... If
			I can hit their shield generator
			at precisely the right frequency,
			I should be able to knock it off-line
			with a single shot...
			Firing...
			Their shields are down...
			The artifacts should be located in
			several small structures...
			arranged in staggered
			formations...
			I'm scanning...
			I think I've found them.
			Lock the coordinates and start
			bringing them up.
			There should be at least two more
			pieces down there.
			I've got them --
			I've lost transporter lock.
			They've managed to get their
			shields back up.
			I need those artifacts. Lock all
			disruptors on target... this time
			I want that outpost destroyed.
			Direct hit on their aft deflector,
			sir... They are undamaged.
			Ensign, scan for Starfleet
			combadge signals. Is Commander
			Riker aboard that ship?
			I can't tell, sir. Sensors are
			unable to penetrate their hull.
			Open a channel.
			This is the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. You are ordered to
			stand down...
			... Drop your shields and prepare
			to be boarded.
			You sent them a message... you
			told them where to find us.
			That's ridiculous... when did I
			have the chance?
			This is set to kill.
			Order your ship to disengage.
			Activate visual.
			Commander. Are you all right?
			Tell them!
			Withdraw the Enterprise, Mister
			Data. That's an order.
			Sir, that is impossible. The ship
			you are on has violated a
			Federation outpost. It is my duty
			to stop it.
			I'm your commanding officer and
			I'm giving you a direct order.
			Understood?
			Commander, if you could explain --
			I've never explained my orders to
			you before and I'm not going to
			start now.
			I have no intention of letting
			them blow us into space.
			If I can set up a low energy com
			link between the ships... I can
			use my personal command codes to
			deactivate their shields.
			Do it.
			Counselor, could Commander Riker
			have been drugged or mentally
			altered in some way to explain
			this?
			I didn't sense anything which
			would indicate that...
			Commander, we are receiving some
			kind of signal from the mercenary
			ship...
			These are Commander Riker's access
			codes... he is attempting to shut
			down our shields...
			That doesn't make any sense. He
			knows those codes would have been
			changed as soon as he was
			captured...
			That is correct, Counselor. He
			does know.
			Mister Worf. Prepare to drop the
			shields.
			Sir? We will be totally
			defenseless.
			I am aware of that.
			The moment they see our --
			That is an order.
			Aye-aye, sir.
			It worked! Their shields are
			dropping...
			Fire!
