			Captain's Log, Stardate 47423.9.
			We have arrived at Boraal Two in
			response to an emergency distress
			call from Lieutenant Worf's foster
			brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has
			been stationed on the planet as a
			cultural observer.
			Mister Data, analysis.
			It appears the planet's atmosphere
			is dissipating, sir. Intense
			plasmonic reactions are destroying
			it.
			How far has it progressed?
			The stratosphere is already
			breaking down, and there are
			turbulent radiation storms across
			much of the surface.
			I estimate the planet will be
			uninhabitable in less than thirty-eight
			hours.
			The distress call was only four
			days ago. Why would Doctor
			Rozhenko have waited so long
			before sending it?
			Atmospheric dissipation is a rare
			and essentially unpredictable
			event. When it occurs, it
			proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko
			would not have had much warning.
			What was that?
			The dissipation effect is
			generating plasmonic energy
			bursts...
			Are they any danger to the ship?
			I do not believe so. However, we
			may experience intermittent system
			failures and power surges as a
			result.
			Keep an eye on it.
			Mister Worf. Any luck?
			There is still no response to our
			hails, sir... I am attempting to
			scan the observation post...
			He could be hurt... maybe he can't
			respond...
			Sensor interference is
			significant, but the post appears
			to be intact... its power grid is
			still functioning...
			However, I am reading no life
			forms within the structure.
			It's hard to believe he would have
			left the post...
			Especially under these
			circumstances...
			Sir, I am detecting faint power
			emissions from a system of caverns
			near the post. It could be a
			deflector shield.
			It can't be native to the planet.
			The Boraalans don't have anything
			close to that level of technology.
			Captain. Request permission to
			lead an Away Team.
			Very well. But regardless of this
			planet's immediate situation, we
			must still observe the Prime
			Directive.
			I'd like to minimize the risk of
			contact with the inhabitants.
			You're to go alone, Mister Worf --
			and I want you surgically altered
			to pass as a Boraalan.
			Yes, sir.
			Worf, you have to try to keep
			still. I need an accurate scan of
			your cranial anatomy...
			I'm sorry, Doctor. Please
			continue.
			You're worried about Nikolai,
			aren't you?
			Yes.
			Are the two of you close?
			We are... brothers.
			You've never talked much about
			him. What's he like?
			Nikolai is older than I... and we
			are not -- alike. We had many
			disagreements as we were growing
			up.
			That's not unusual.
			Nikolai... has a mind of his own.
			He attended Starfleet Academy --
			but he was unable to follow the
			rules. He left after one year.
			However, he has many fine
			qualities. He is... brilliant.
			Persuasive. A natural leader...
			Sounds intriguing... I look
			forward to meeting him.
			Worf to Enterprise...
			Go ahead...
			I am picking up faint life signs
			approximately two-hundred meters
			from my position. I am heading
			toward them.
			Understood. The plasmonic
			interference is getting worse...
			start checking in every thirty
			minutes to make sure we have a fix
			on you.
			Aye, sir.
			What are you doing here... ?
			You're not from our village. Who
			are you?
			Who is this... ?
			My name is Worf. I am a...
			traveller...
			How did you survive the storms?
			I'd recognize that voice anywhere.
			Is it really you, Worf?
			It's good to see you...
			You've changed a lot in four
			years...
			Nikolai... ?
			This is my brother, Worf...
			He's come to help us.
			If you were able to get here, the
			storms must have subsided... Do
			you think it's safe enough to
			return to the surface?
			Please... I must speak with my
			brother for a moment...
			Nikolai, what have you done?
			They were dying.
			I refused to sit there... safe in
			that observation post... and watch
			it happen.
			I set up a deflector shield to
			screen these caves from the
			radiation and then I brought them
			here.
			What have you told them?
			They think I'm a Boraalan. I told
			them I'm from another village far
			from here.
			At least you had that much
			sense...
			I knew the Enterprise was in this
			sector when I sent my distress
			call... but I wasn't sure you'd be
			the one to come.
			I'm truly glad you're here, Worf.
			There is nothing we can do for
			these people. You have only
			postponed their deaths.
			I'd like to discuss that with your
			Captain.
			I am certain he will want to speak
			with you.
			Friends... Worf and I must return
			to the surface...
			He has equipment and provisions
			and needs help to bring them here.
			We'll return shortly.
			It's too dangerous. The storms
			can occur without warning. If
			you're caught in one...
			Don't worry...
			My brother is a seer. He
			understands the nature of the
			storms. He'll know when it's safe
			to travel.
			That is correct.
			Our Seer died when the storms
			first came. We have been without
			his guidance for many weeks.
			Let me go with you. I know the
			terrain better than anyone, and I
			can help--
			No, Vorin. Worf and I will be
			fine. We'll be back soon.
			Doctor, you were fully aware that
			the atmospheric dissipation could
			not be stopped. What were you
			hoping to accomplish by assisting
			these people?
			I was trying to give them a
			future.
			I propose we create an atmospheric
			shield on the planet. We can
			camouflage the equipment just like
			my observation post. No one will
			ever know it's there.
			You can't be serious.
			I realize it would only provide
			atmosphere for a limited area of
			the surface. But it would be
			enough to save one village.
			I have no intention of compounding
			what you've already done by
			committing another gross violation
			of the Prime Directive.
			The Boraalans have a rich and
			beautiful culture... a deep
			spiritual life. They deserve the
			chance to survive.
			Isn't that what the Prime
			Directive was truly intended to
			do... allow cultures to survive
			and grow naturally?
			Not entirely. The Prime Directive
			was designed to ensure non-interference.
			But aren't we intefering either
			way? If we take no action, it's
			a conscious decision to let the
			Boraalans die.
			Exactly.
			We have the power to save some of
			them... all we have to do is
			exercise it.
			The Prime Directive is a principle
			we've all sworn to uphold. Until
			that is changed, we cannot follow
			any other course of action. Is
			that understood?
			There are several log recorders in
			my observation post... They
			contain most of my research.
			Since it appears that the only way
			I'll be able to preserve Boraalan
			culture is in a museum, I would
			like permission to return to the
			surface and retrieve them.
			I'm afraid that won't be possible.
			You may have full use of the
			ship's computers to set up a com
			link and upload your data from
			here.
			If there's nothing further, you're
			dismissed.
			Nikolai... I am sorry. I wish
			there were another way.
			I am quite familiar with our
			communications systems. If you
			wish, I will help you set up your
			com link.
			No. I'll do it myself.
			Captain, the atmospheric
			dissipation has accelerated over
			the past several hours. I
			estimate the planet's atmosphere
			will be completely gone within
			four minutes.
			I've completed my data uplink,
			Captain.
			With your permission, I'd like to
			integrate my research logs into
			the ship's library computer.
			Of course.
			The mesosphere is gone. Ionic
			reactions are now beginning to
			break down the troposphere.
			Put it on-screen...
			What's going on?
			It appears that the plasmonic
			reactions are continuing to
			interfere with our sensors.
			I thought you'd already
			compensated for that.
			I had, sir...
			I will attempt to engage
			additional filtering elements...
			Visual re-established.
			This is one of the times when we
			must face the ramifications of the
			Prime Directive... and honor the
			lives we cannot save.
			I find no honor in this
			whatsoever, Captain. You'll
			excuse me if I don't stay.
			Number One, I'll be in my Ready
			Room. You have the Bridge.
			Helm, take us out of orbit. Set
			course for Starbase eighty-seven,
			warp five.
			Aye, sir.
			What happened?
			There appears to be an unusual
			power drain in the EPS
			distribution net...
			What's the source?
			Unknown, sir... it is difficult to
			localize.
			The power drain has registered on
			my security grid as well, sir...
			it appears to be coming from deck
			ten.
			All right, Worf. Get a security
			team on it.
			Concentrate your scans on the EPS
			transfer links...
			Computer. Open Holodeck Five.
			Unable to comply. Holodeck Five
			is in use.
			Override. Authorization, Worf
			Theta-six-one-nine.
			Unable to comply. Holodeck
			control systems have been
			bypassed.
			Worf... Come in...
			What are you doing here?
			I have to show you something.
			Follow me...
			Whatever you do, stay quiet.
			Look.
			I've done what you refused to do.
			I've saved them.
			I started thinking about this days
			ago... when it became clear the
			planet was doomed. I knew if I
			could get access to your ship's
			computer, I'd be able to generate
			a replica of the caves...
			The hard part was transporting the
			Boraalans into the Holodeck
			without anyone on the Enterprise
			noticing. But I was able to blank
			out the sensors and make it look
			like interference from the
			plasmonic (TECHS).
			And it worked. Perfectly. The
			Boraalans were transported while
			they were sleeping -- they didn't
			even know anything had happened.
			Bridge.
			It's a simple plan, really...
			that's the beauty of it.
			Trust me, Worf -- this is going to
			work.
			Trust you? You never had any
			intention of obeying the Captain!
			I wasn't going to let those people
			die just because your Captain
			started quoting Federation dogma
			to me.
			Your duty was to respect the
			Captain's orders and uphold the
			Prime Directive.
			Duty. That's all that really
			matters to you, isn't it?
			Well, I refuse to be bound by an
			abstraction. The lives of the
			people of Boraal are far more
			important to me.
			Worf... you worry too much. You
			always did. Everything will work
			out.
			You have disgraced yourself... and
			you have disgraced me. I want
			nothing more to do with you.
			You realize your career is
			finished.
			I know that, Captain. And I would
			do it all again.
			What do you expect us to do now?
			You've left us with a colony of
			Boraalans who think they're still
			on their planet.
			I didn't beam them up here without
			a plan. I've given this a lot of
			thought.
			I believe we can find a new
			planet... an M-class world...
			which can become their new home.
			A home which would look very
			different from Boraal... you can't
			really believe they'd be fooled...
			That's where the Holodeck comes
			in. I'll go back and tell the
			Boraalans we're going on a
			journey... to a different place,
			where they'll be safe from the
			storms. The Holodeck can change
			the terrain gradually as we
			travel... so that at the end, the
			Holodeck simulation will match the
			conditions on the new planet.
			And then, we'll beam them down.
			What if it doesn't work? What if
			they become aware that something
			strange is going on?
			I can't prepare for every
			contingency. But I assure you --
			I'm used to thinking on my feet.
			I'll deal with the situation as it
			evolves.
			I'm not enthusiastic about this
			plan... but I don't see another
			option. We'll give it a try.
			There are countless M-class
			planets in Federation space which
			could support the Boraalans.
			We'll have to narrow the
			parameters.
			I estimate it will take
			approximately nine and one half
			hours to complete the analysis.
			And even then there's no guarantee
			we'll be able to find a suitable
			planet...
			That is correct.
			Excuse me, Captain... but I think
			you better take a look at this...
			What is it?
			We've got a problem, sir. I don't
			think it's going to be possible to
			keep this Holodeck simulation
			stable.
			Why not?
			The plasmonic energy surges from
			the planet have affected some of
			the ship's systems. We're having
			problems with the EPS subsystems
			and the power distribution matrix.
			As a result, the Holodeck imaging
			processor has been severely
			destabilized.
			It's not a question of whether the
			simulation is going to break
			down... it's a question of when.
			There's no way around it?
			Not while it's running. To fix
			it, I'd have to shut down all of
			the Holodecks and re-initialize
			the entire system.
			That would take hours...
			We'll just have to hope the
			simulation holds long enough.
			Very well. Let's try it.
			Monitor the situation closely,
			Mister La Forge.
			Keep an open com link with the
			Holodeck so you can be apprised of
			any problems.
			Aye, sir.
			I'll go back to the Holodeck as
			soon as my surgical alterations
			are complete. I'll prepare the
			Boraalans for their "journey."
			Considering the situation you've
			put us in, I don't think it's wise
			to leave you alone with those
			people. Mister Worf will
			accompany you.
			Sir. Perhaps someone else would
			be a better choice. Counselor
			Troi is familiar with --
			No, the Boraalans already know
			you. There's no need to introduce
			anyone new.
			Yes, sir.
			Keep a close eye on your brother.
			I don't want him making the
			situation any worse than it is.
			Here... we have food...
			My friends, this is difficult to
			say... but you have the right to
			know.
			By the time Worf and I reached the
			surface, the village was gone.
			The storms had destroyed
			everything. There is nothing for
			us to return to.
			We can't survive in here... our
			supplies won't last forever.
			That is why we must leave. There
			is a place far from here where
			there are no storms. It will be
			a difficult journey, but in the
			end, we will have a new home...
			I know a way through the caves.
			We can travel safely until we
			return to the surface.
			Where is this new land?
			As we said, it is far from here.
			It will not be like the home you
			knew... even the stars may be
			different.
			Why would they be different? And
			how do you know we'll be safe
			there?
			Vorin. Remember -- my brother is
			a Seer. If he says we'll be
			safe... you can trust that we
			will be.
			What's wrong?
			Look...
			Do not worry... it is an omen...
			What does it mean?
			This is the sign of... La Forge.
			It is a message to travellers...
			It is said that when these lines
			appear and disappear in a pool of
			water...
			The road ahead will be filled with
			good fortune...
			Hang in there, Worf... just give
			me a second...
			There, that should do it...
			You see? Our journey is already
			blessed. We have a long road
			ahead. Let's have a meal, and
			then we can make preparations to
			leave.
			Good work...
			It seems we're not such a bad team
			after all.
			We are not a "team." I am here
			because Captain Picard ordered me
			here.
			Worf -- don't we share the same
			goal? Aren't we both trying to
			make this plan work?
			Only because you forced us into
			it.
			I'm not ashamed of what I did.
			I'm not sorry I saved their
			lives...
			You have not changed. You still
			expect others to solve the
			problems you create.
			I'm not here to work out the
			issues of our childhood. I'm
			trying to save a people I care
			about. And if that upsets you --
			so be it.
			These are the two planets which
			best match our search criteria...
			Draygo Four features an unusually
			large temperate zone. However, it
			is within three light-years of
			Cardassian space.
			There are constant border disputes
			in that sector...
			The alternative is Vacca Six. It
			is located in the Cabral sector...
			That's pretty isolated...
			It offers a less hospitable
			climate than the Boraalans are
			accustomed to. However, it would
			still appear to be the better
			choice.
			Do you disagree, Doctor?
			No, Data... you're right. It's
			just that... the enormity of what
			we're doing is overwhelming.
			We're deciding the future of a
			species.
			It is a formidable responsibility.
			There are so many questions we
			can't answer... what if the
			climate is so different that it
			affects them in some way we can't
			anticipate? Can we even be sure
			they'll survive? And if they do,
			how will their society evolve
			here... and what impact will it
			have on the Vaccan system?
			We have no idea what this decision
			will mean for their future.
			I do not believe we can offer any
			guarantees, Doctor. We can simply
			make the best choice we have at
			the moment.
			Right.
			Well, Vacca Six it is, then.
			Data to Bridge...
			Picard here...
			We have located a new home for the
			Boraalans, sir. It is Vacca Six
			in the Cabral sector.
			At maximum warp, we could be there
			in less than forty-two hours, sir.
			Very well.
			Helm. Set course for Vacca Six.
			What is this?
			Our chronicle.
			The history of our village.
			Doesn't your village keep a
			chronicle?
			Not in this manner.
			Then how do you teach your
			children their history... who
			their ancestors were... and where
			they come from?
			We tell each other stories... make
			up songs...
			Stories change with each person
			who tells them. This...
			... will always be the same.
			Our chronicle has been maintained
			for seventeen generations. I was
			only able to save the last six.
			This shows the destruction of our
			village... and this is you and
			Nikolai leading us to safety.
			We must leave. Gather your
			belongings.
			One of the scrolls is gone...
			I must have dropped it in the
			passageway... I'll go look...
			We must stay together. You will
			have to leave it behind.
			Worf. The chronicle is the life
			of our village. Without that
			past, our future means nothing.
			I must find it.
			Go... and return quickly.
			Seer!
			I'm an old man... would you help
			me with my gear?
			That is Tarrana... my daughter.
			I am fortunate that she was old
			enough to survive the storms.
			She is a... fine girl.
			She is a beautiful girl.
			She hasn't been promised to
			anyone. If I don't reach our new
			home -- I would like her to become
			your wife.
			You will reach your new home... I
			promise.
			All right, everybody... back
			off...
			I know things must look very
			strange to you... but everything's
			going to be fine. No one is going
			to hurt you...
			We're friends of Nikolai and
			Worf... Don't be afraid...
			Nikolai... ?
			Yes, he is my friend... and that
			means you are, too. I promise I
			won't hurt you...
			Please... help me...
			Where am I?
			I'm sorry, there's nothing I can
			do... his neural physiology is
			unusual. I can't wipe his memory.
			I see...
			How is he?
			As well as can be expected. I
			gave him a mild sedative, and
			Deanna's been talking to him the
			whole time. He's calmed down a
			lot.
			Does he understand the situation?
			I think so.
			All right. Get in touch with
			Mister Worf... make sure he knows
			what's happened.
			This is Captain Picard.
			Vorin, isn't it?
			Why did you bring us here?
			Your planet was dying... it could
			no longer support life. So we
			took you away from it.
			But... we never left the caves...
			We have the ability to create
			the... illusion of other places,
			like the caves on your planet.
			You have actually been on this
			starship for the last two days...
			not on Boraal.
			Then our home... is gone?
			Yes.
			Vorin. Listen to me. We can
			travel to many worlds. We will
			take you to one where your people
			can build a new life...
			A new life... ?
			A chance... for your people...
			your culture... to survive and
			grow.
			How can we grow when everything
			that made us who we are... is
			gone?
			I will carry this. Go join the
			others...
			Thank you, Seer...
			It'll be dark in a few hours...
			Can you tell Mister La Forge to
			create a suitable campsite for us
			a few kilometers from here?
			What's the matter?
			Vorin has left the Holodeck.
			How did he get out?
			I don't know. But Doctor Crusher
			cannot erase his memory.
			What will they do with him?
			They have explained the situation
			to him... he must make his own
			decision.
			Are you saying that if Vorin wants
			to come back in here... they'll
			let him?
			That is his right. He's not a
			prisoner.
			If he comes back and tells the
			others what he's seen on the
			Enterprise, everything we've done
			will be for nothing...
			You should've considered that
			before you beamed them aboard!
			But you never think about the
			consequences of your acts.
			If you mean I'm willing to do
			something -- while others hesitate --
			that's true.
			Wherever you go, you create chaos.
			How many times did our parents lie
			awake at night, wondering what
			kind of trouble you were in?
			If only I could have been more
			like you -- Worf, the perfect son.
			I was not perfect -- but I was not
			wild and disobedient.
			Of course not. You were too busy
			doing your duty.
			I would rather be accused of that --
			than of making our mother weep.
			But it is clear you have no
			intention of changing. I see no
			reason to discuss it further.
			Commander, the Holodeck
			malfunctions are increasing...
			I'm running every stabilization
			routine I know...
			How much longer until we reach the
			new planet?
			We'll be there in less than eight
			hours... You just have to hold
			things together a little while
			longer...
			Someone is coming...
			May I speak with you?
			Of course.
			I don't know what Nikolai said to
			you, but please... forgive him.
			It is an... old argument.
			I've never seen him like this.
			He's usually so confident, so sure
			of himself... But now he seems...
			different. Do you know why?
			No. I do not.
			Ever since Vorin was lost, people
			have been afraid... worried that
			we won't reach our new home.
			We need Nikolai's strength now...
			more than ever.
			When the storms first came to our
			village, many of us were ready to
			die... but Nikolai refused to let
			us. He gathered us together and
			led us into the caves. He saved
			us.
			He's a brave and compassionate
			man... and I love him. Please go
			to him... make things right
			between you. I want us to be a
			family.
			Us?
			Yes. I want you to consider
			yourself my brother.
			After all -- you're going to be
			the uncle of my child.
			We are in synchronous orbit above
			the beam-down site, sir.
			Good.
			Mister La Forge. How much longer
			before we can transport the
			Boraalans?
			A few more hours, sir... but we've
			got some problems here.
			I don't think the Holodeck's going
			to last that long. We've had
			materialization errors and
			resolution failures all over the
			place -- and it's getting worse.
			The simulation could fall apart
			any minute.
			We'll have the Transporter room
			standing by...
			We may need to transport the
			Boraalans whether you're ready or
			not. Keep Mister Worf apprised of
			the situation.
			Aye, sir.
			Commander, you have the Bridge...
			We still have one more problem to
			worry about...
			Yes...
			Vorin. We've arrived at the
			planet I told you about...
			Have you made a decision?
			I believe I would like to go back
			to my people.
			I see.
			And what do you intend to tell
			them?
			I don't know...
			If you tell them the truth -- what
			will happen? Will they believe
			you?
			I'm not sure. It is a fantastic
			story.
			It's possible they'll think you
			had an hallucination... or even
			that you're insane...
			I don't think I'd like to live my
			life knowing what I know -- and
			being thought of as a madman...
			On the other hand, they may
			believe your fantastic story.
			They would learn about alien
			worlds and starships...
			That would be disastrous. It
			would destroy everything they
			believed in...
			I can't tell them the truth... but
			I don't think I can live with a
			secret.
			You can stay here. Make a future
			for yourself... with us.
			I need some time... please...
			How could you have mated with a
			Boraalan? What were you thinking?
			I don't owe you an explanation.
			It's a matter between Dobara and
			me.
			As usual, you are thinking only of
			yourself.
			And as usual, you're here to point
			out the error of my ways.
			You have treated Dobara with
			dishonor.
			No -- I love her and I intend to
			raise our child together.
			That is impossible -- I cannot
			allow you to stay here.
			You will have to kill me first --
			What does it mean... ?
			The storms have returned.
			We will be killed...
			No! Worf has the power to end the
			storms once and for all...
			Yes. But everyone must take
			shelter in the tents.
			The tents won't protect us...
			Worf will protect you. You must
			trust him.
			Commander... it might help if you
			could produce a storm...
			... wind, lightning and thunder.
			I'll see what I can do...
			The storm is getting worse! You
			must go to your tents -- now!
			Commander... Energize...
			The storms will not return.
			What did I tell you? My brother
			has saved us.
			Captain's Log, Stardate 47427.2.
			The Boraalans have safely reached
			the site of what will eventually
			become their new village. None of
			them suspects they ever left their
			planet. However, our success has
			come at a high price...
			I think it was some form of ritual
			suicide...
			He said he had nowhere to go...
			He'd have died even if we hadn't
			interfered...
			But he wouldn't have died alone...
			and afraid...
			Are you saying you're sorry we
			saved the Boraalans?
			No, of course not. Our plan
			worked out well for them...
			But I wish Vorin could have
			bridged the gap between our
			cultures. I would have liked the
			chance to know him better.
			Dobara... go inside.
			Nikolai -- don't...
			Please.
			I told you -- you'll have to kill
			me to get me away from here.
			I don't want to fight you,
			Nikolai.
			Nothing was ever easy between us,
			was it?
			No.
			It's my fault. If I'd been more
			like you, we wouldn't have had so
			many problems.
			If you'd been more like me --
			those people would not be here
			now. You gave them a chance at a
			new life.
			Worf... I intend to share that
			life with them. The village will
			need someone to begin a new
			chronicle... and my child will
			need a father. My place is here.
			Don't you see? I'm finally taking
			responsibility.
			You were never good at drawing...
			how will you keep a chronicle?
			I learn quickly.
			Then perhaps there is hope...
			May I take this with me?
			It's yours.
			I will attempt to explain all this
			to mother and father.
			They won't understand.
			They may. I will tell them... you
			are happy.
