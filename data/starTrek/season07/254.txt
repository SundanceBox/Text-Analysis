			Enter.
			Worf, they're going to be here any
			minute.
			I am having... problems.
			If I didn't know you better, I'd
			say you were procrastinating.
			Klingons do not procrastinate.
			It is a... tactical delay.
			All you have to do is spend five
			minutes greeting the Iyaarans and
			another hour or so making small
			talk at the reception. I'm the
			one who has to spend the next
			three days escorting them around
			the ship.
			I do not enjoy these diplomatic
			situations.
			It's all part of being in
			Starfleet.
			There.
			And I do not see why it is
			necessary to wear these ridiculous
			uniforms.
			Protocol.
			They look like... dresses.
			Worf, that is a remarkably
			outmoded and sexist attitude. I'm
			surprised at you.
			Besides, you look great in a
			dress.
			Ambassador Loquel... Ambassador
			Byleth. I'm Captain Picard.
			Welcome aboard the Enterprise.
			It is our pleasure to be here,
			Captain.
			We are honored to be the site of
			the first cultural exchange
			between the Iyaaran people and the
			Federation.
			Yes, yes. The next seven days
			should prove most illuminating.
			Allow me to introduce Voval. He
			will be taking you back to our
			homeworld.
			Pleased to meet you.
			I'm looking forward to meeting
			with the Premier of Iyar.
			There will be a reception in your
			honor where you'll meet the rest
			of the Senior Staff. I'll be on
			my way to your home world, of
			course -- but I'm leaving you in
			the hands of my most experienced
			officers.
			Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon
			Empire, is our head of security.
			He will be responsible for your
			safety while you're on board.
			Counselor Deanna Troi from the
			Planet Betazed will be your
			personal liaison, Ambassador
			Loquel.
			Ambassador Loquel, it's an honor
			to meet you. May I show you to
			your quarters before we attend the
			reception?
			Please.
			And my First Officer, Commander
			William Riker from the planet
			Earth, will be assigned to you,
			Ambassador Byleth.
			I want this one.
			Commander Riker is a skilled
			diplomat, with wide experience in
			inter-species contact --
			I'm sure, I'm sure. But I have
			decided. I want this Lieutenant
			Worf.
			Well. That will be -- just fine.
			Mister Worf... ?
			Yes... Ambassador, I would be
			pleased to --
			Yes, yes. Enough of that. Show
			me to my quarters.
			So first thing tomorrow, I thought
			I'd take you on a tour... show you
			the operational centers and the
			residential decks of the ship.
			Then after that, we could spend
			some time discussing some of the
			cultural underpinnings of your
			society --
			Are you going to eat?
			Excuse me?
			You have no food on your plate.
			Are you going to eat?
			Oh... actually, I was waiting
			until we got to the dessert tray.
			"Dessert... " What is that?
			It's something we eat after the
			main course. It's usually very
			sweet... usually very bad for
			you. We eat it purely for
			pleasure.
			If you ask me, it's the best part
			of any meal.
			My people eat only for
			nourishment.
			Let me introduce you to some of my
			favorites...
			Here we have peach cobbler with
			whipped cream. Tarvokian powder
			cake...
			But over here -- this is my very
			favorite.
			This is a Ktarian Chocolate Puff.
			I'm not exactly sure what's in
			it... but I think there are at
			least seventeen varieties of
			chocolate inside.
			It is... it is...
			Delicious?
			"Delicious... "
			Ambassador... I think we're going
			to get along very well.
			Shall we?
			This is unacceptable.
			I am sorry if you do not care for
			our --
			Bring me new food. I require a
			higher protein and enzymatic
			content.
			Our custom in a situation like
			this is to serve ourselves. It's
			called a "buffet," and usually
			people prefer to choose --
			Bring... me... new... food.
			Ambassador...
			It is all right, Doctor. I am
			happy to bring more food.
			How is your diplomatic assignment
			progressing so far?
			Fine.
			I have found that in moments of
			diplomatic tension, it is often
			helpful to find elements of
			commonality.
			Ambassador Byleth is...
			demanding... temperamental...
			rude...
			You share all of those qualities
			in abundance. Perhaps you should
			build on your similarities.
			So... I understand your homeworld
			has some of the most spectacular
			crystal formations in the sector.
			Is there any place in particular
			that you recommend I visit while
			I'm there?
			No.
			Yes, well... what's our ETA?
			Seventeen hours, thirty-two
			minutes.
			I think I'll go update my
			itinerary...
			What happened?
			There has been a system wide power
			failure.
			What's the cause?
			We have entered an energy
			disruption field. I do not
			recognize the configuration.
			Attitude controls failing.
			There's an M-Class planet in this
			system. Can we reach it?
			I will try.
			Inertial dampeners are off-line...
			life support is failing...
			Entering the planet's
			atmosphere...
			Prepare for impact.
			Voval...
			You may have a concussion... try
			not to move.
			Picard to Enterprise...
			Picard to Enterprise... do you
			read me?
			I can't get through... too much
			interference...
			There's a structure and some
			energy readings... about two
			kilometers south of here...
			I'm going to try to find help. Do
			you understand?
			Try to stay conscious. And don't
			leave the shuttle... there's some
			sort of plasma energy on the
			surface.
			I'll be back as soon as I can.
			You're late.
			Late... it is oh-five hundred
			hours!
			I told you last night I wanted to
			meet at this time. We are
			supposed to tour the arboretum and
			bio-labs.
			I do not recall you saying
			anything about --
			Are you calling me a liar?
			No... I simply do not remember the
			conversation.
			I will have to add this to your
			list of inadequacies.
			Now, don't just stand there. Get
			dressed and meet me in the
			arboretum.
			This deck is devoted mainly to
			stellar cartography, biological
			research, and astrophysics...
			We have over a thousand people on
			board, engaged in all facets of
			the ship's --
			Are you sure you don't want some
			of this...
			This... "papalla juice?"
			No, thank you. I'm still
			recovering from all those desserts
			last night.
			Are you sure? It is very...
			"delicious."
			I'm sure.
			Please. You have been so kind.
			Please.
			Yum.
			Next we're going to go to Deck
			Eight, which is interesting
			because it's not really finished.
			It's sort of a... multi-purpose
			deck...
			Sometimes when we need an extra
			lab... another cabin, we --
			Ambassador?
			What is this?
			That's a child.
			"Child"...
			Children are our offspring. Our
			young. They grow into adults over
			a period of many years... they
			grow into beings like us.
			Offspring.
			Ambassador, I'm curious... how
			does your species procreate?
			Post-cellular compounding. We
			emerge from the natal pod fully
			grown.
			I see...
			Do you have a name?
			Eric...
			Eric, do you like... dessert?
			May I give Eric some dessert?
			That sounds like a wonderful idea.
			Is someone there? Who's there... ?
			What do you want? Who are you...
			Shhh...
			Who... are you?
			Wait. Someone else was with me...
			the pilot of the shuttlecraft...
			he's wounded... please, he needs
			your help...
			He's dead.
			Hello...
			This smells good. Thank you...
			This is a Terellian cargo
			freighter, isn't it? Is this your
			ship? Were you one of the crew?
			No... I was a passenger... we
			crashed...
			How many people survived? Are you
			the only one?
			Well, you're certainly not a
			Terellian... unless you've lost
			two of your arms...
			What's your name?
			I'm Jean-Luc Picard. I'm a
			Starfleet officer.
			Anna.
			Anna...
			Anna, is there anyone else on this
			planet?
			How long have you been here?
			I... don't know. You can't see
			the sun here... I've... lost track
			of time.
			Do you remember the date your ship
			crashed?
			Stardate... 40812...
			That's seven years ago.
			Years...
			Anna... it's all right...
			Seven years... I thought... one
			year... or two maybe... but how
			could it be seven...
			Anna, listen to me...
			On my shuttle, there's a lot of
			equipment that survived the crash.
			We can use it to contact
			Starfleet. They'll send a ship
			for us. We can leave.
			Leave?
			Yes. Both of us. If you can get
			me back to the shuttle...
			Don't move... it's bad...
			Don't worry... I won't move.
			You have... three broken ribs...
			The restriction device... will...
			hold the bones in place... let
			them...
			Let them knit... let the bones
			knit...
			It's been a long time.... since I
			talked to anyone...
			I used to talk... to myself. But
			then I thought... it might mean
			that I was crazy. So I stopped
			talking...
			It will be a while before you can
			walk.
			Anna... maybe you could go to the
			shuttle... bring the equipment
			back here...
			I can do that.
			Good.
			Go into the cockpit, and look for
			a small com panel in the center of
			the instrument bay. See if you
			can remove it, and bring it to me.
			Stay in bed. I'll be back.
			What is it?
			I just... wanted to make sure you
			were real.
			The Engineering sections encompass
			twelve decks of the secondary
			hull. Deck forty-two contains the
			antimatter storage facility. Deck
			thirty-six houses the --
			What is the mass flow rate of the
			antimatter replenishment stream to
			the containment pods?
			Excuse me?
			The antimatter replenishment rate.
			What is it?
			I am... not certain of the exact
			rate.
			Perhaps there is someone here who
			does know the answer.
			You. Are you smarter than this
			one?
			Ah... well... why do you ask?
			Never mind.
			I wish to see the Bussard
			collectors. Take me to them.
			This way.
			Do you bathe?
			I am going to kill him! With my
			bare hands, I will take his neck
			and --
			Worf.
			I have failed in my mission,
			Commander. I am clearly a bad
			diplomat. For the sake of the
			ship and the Federation... I
			request reassignment.
			Denied.
			But Commander, these Iyaarans are
			irritating... arrogant... They
			cannot be reasoned with!
			Ambassador Loquel is quite
			pleasant.
			I will admit, he's a little...
			unusual.
			What have you learned about him so
			far?
			He seems preoccupied with...
			recreation. In the past two days,
			I've spent more time in Ten
			Forward and the Holodeck than I
			have in the past two months.
			And he's obsessed with food.
			Especially chocolate.
			You must be in heaven.
			To be honest... he's even testing
			my limits...
			You see? They are insane!
			Worf... you've been patient with
			Ambassador Byleth, and that's
			good. But maybe it's time to let
			him know that some behavior is
			unacceptable to us. I think it's
			all right to suggest limits for
			the Ambassador...
			Maybe we need to loosen things up
			a little bit... meet in a less
			official capacity.
			Like what?
			Well... how about a friendly game
			of poker?
			What... what are you doing? Get
			back in bed!
			Anna... why is the door kept
			bolted from the outside?
			For your protection...
			From what?
			There are dangerous animals here.
			I got the com panel... it's right
			here.
			It wasn't easy... I had to force
			open the equipment bay to get
			it...
			If I can boost the output field,
			I might be able to send out a
			distress signal...
			There's something wrong with it...
			What's the matter?
			The entire transmitter module's
			been destroyed...
			How did this happen? It looks as
			though it's been hit by a phaser
			blast.
			I had to use a phaser to cut it
			free... maybe I accidentally
			damaged it... you can fix it,
			can't you?
			No.
			I'm sorry.... I'm sorry...
			I'm sorry...
			We will get out of here, Anna.
			But it's not going to be easy...
			we need to work together...
			I can't believe I did that...
			ruined our one chance... after
			waiting so long...
			At first, I kept hoping that I'd
			be rescued... every day I'd set up
			a microfusion flare... and I'd
			look up in the sky and wait for
			someone to take me away...
			... and it never happened.
			There's a precipice near here...
			I used to go there and stare down
			into the gorge... and think... I
			could just step off... and it
			would all be over...
			Then I realized... it was the hope
			that was driving me crazy... I had
			to accept that I was never going
			to get out of here...
			Anna... no matter how long it
			takes, we will get out of here.
			From the moment I saw you, I knew
			you were here to save me...
			I'll do anything you want... just
			don't leave me. I don't want to
			be alone again...
			I love you...
			I found some coltayin roots.
			They're not much to look at... but
			they taste good...
			What are you doing?
			Trying to dislodge this power
			cell...
			You're... going to hurt yourself
			up there... let me...
			I've almost got it...
			There.
			Its energy relays are corroded...
			but it might be able to hold one
			more charge...
			If I can regenerate the cell... we
			may be able to reactivate the
			shuttlecraft's engines...
			Well... I'd say this is cause for
			celebration...
			You know, I may still have some
			Terellian spices around here... I
			could boil these roots and make a
			nice broth for us...
			Sounds delightful...
			Jean-Luc... if we ever do get out
			of here... will you promise to
			show me this starship of yours...
			this Enterprise?
			Of course.
			If you'll hand me my tricorder, I
			think I can repair these energy
			relays.
			I meant what I said before...
			I do love you.
			Anna. I... care for you a great
			deal. I am grateful that you
			saved my life... you are a warm
			and compassionate person. I have
			a great deal of sympathy for what
			you've gone through... alone...
			here on this planet...
			But I don't think you're really in
			love with me.
			How can you say that? Of course
			I love you...
			I'm the first person you've seen
			in seven years. And I've brought
			you the hope of leaving this
			place...
			Isn't it possible that your
			feelings are a little... confused
			right now?
			No... I know how I feel. And I
			love you.
			Look... sometimes when a person
			has gone through a traumatic
			experience, like yours... they
			come to look upon the person who
			rescues them as a sort of...
			larger than life figure.
			Sometimes they become infatuated
			with their rescuer. They may even
			think that... they're in love with
			that person...
			So... you're not attracted to me.
			That's not true. You're a very
			lovely woman. I just think this
			is... a little premature. We
			don't know anything about each
			other.
			I understand... and I'm sorry if
			I made you uncomfortable.
			It's all right.
			It'll take a couple of hours for
			the power cell to charge. After
			that, we'll have to take it to the
			shuttle immediately. The cell
			casing is already breaking down...
			We're going to get out of here,
			Anna.
			I'll bet ten.
			Ambassador, the bet goes to you...
			I will... "see" the bet.
			And I will... "raise" ten.
			That's twenty to me...
			I'm in. And I raise twenty.
			You are -- you are...
			...bluffing.
			Excuse me, Ambassador. Those are
			my chips.
			You are in error. Those chips are
			mine.
			I saw you take two chips from my
			pile.
			You dare to accuse me of stealing?
			Yes.
			You are lying because you are
			losing the game!
			Perhaps I am losing because you've
			been cheating all along!
			Wait a minute, let's just calm
			down...
			Even if I were cheating, how would
			a plodding animal like you know
			it?
			You are an insulting, pompous
			fool! If you were not an
			Ambassador, I would disembowel you
			right here!
			Do not let my title inhibit you,
			Klingon!
			Lieutenant Worf -- stop! That's
			an order!
			Yes! Good!
			Wonderful... very good!
			Thank you, Lieutenant Worf. I
			think I understand now. That was
			a very effective demonstration.
			What?
			If you will excuse me, I would
			like to document this experience.
			The power cell's ready. We need
			to get to the shuttle...
			We can't go right now...
			Why not?
			The plasma storms are too
			strong... it's dangerous. Wait
			a few hours... then we'll go.
			We don't have a few hours. I told
			you, the cell's already
			degrading...
			Jean-Luc... it's a difficult
			journey... The restriction field
			will make it hard for you to
			walk...
			I'm feeling much better now. And
			I don't intend to use this any
			longer...
			No... you can't remove it yet --
			Anna.
			There's no pain. It would seem
			that my ribs weren't broken after
			all...
			Jean-Luc...
			What the hell's going on? Why are
			you trying to keep me here?
			Please... I love you...
			Why do you keep me locked inside
			this freighter? You say there are
			dangerous animals... but I've yet
			to see or hear a single one of
			them...
			Jean-Luc...
			And what about that com panel?
			You said you damaged it while
			cutting it out of the shuttle...
			Did you? I find it hard to
			believe you would be that clumsy
			with the one piece of equipment
			that could save you after seven
			years.
			And what was this really for... to
			keep me immobilized?
			Please... I was so afraid... I
			didn't want you to leave me...
			So you found it necessary to hold
			me captive?
			I was scared... I wanted you to
			stay... to love me...
			I'm going to go find that shuttle
			myself...
			No...
			Anna...
			Don't fight me...
			Anna, no.
			You should love me now. We're
			together... we depend on each
			other... I know more about you...
			Love me.
			Stop it!
			I failed... you don't love me...
			it's over...
			Anna, wait... where are you going?
			Anna!
			Hello! Is anyone in there?
			Hello!
			Over here! There's a door on the
			opposite side!
			Over here! The door's over here!
			Voval...
			I thought you were dead...
			Dead?
			Yes. There's a woman who lives
			here... she went to the shuttle...
			she told me you were dead...
			Yes... that is understandable...
			When my species is injured, our
			metabolic rate slows until our
			body can heal itself...
			This state could easily be
			mistaken for death.
			I see...
			When you did not return to the
			shuttle... I attempted to track
			you.
			The surface conditions made it
			very difficult...
			So cold...
			I saw someone running away from
			here... was it the woman?
			Yes...
			Why would she leave this shelter?
			She was upset.
			Do you think she might... harm
			herself?
			There's a dangerous precipice near
			here... she was headed in that
			direction...
			It's possible...
			Then we should go find her.
			All right. You stay here -- warm
			yourself. I'll go look for her...
			We will go together.
			Captain -- this ridge extends for
			a kilometer in either direction.
			I suggest we separate -- we can
			search it twice as fast.
			Anna!
			Anna...
			Get away from me...
			You don't have to do this. I
			found Voval, the shuttle pilot --
			he's still alive. He can help us
			get away...
			I don't care.
			I'll jump... unless you promise...
			to love me...
			Anna --
			No... no, I won't promise that.
			You've been manipulating me,
			haven't you?
			Jean-Luc, what are you saying?
			Your necklace. I broke it. It
			was lying in the cargo freighter,
			by the fire... I left it there.
			Now it's whole again and back on
			your neck. How?
			Tell me about your love... I must
			know...
			Where's Voval? Isn't it
			convenient that he arrived at the
			freighter only moments after you
			left... and then he insisted that
			I come looking for you. He took
			me here to the ledge... where I
			found you... on the cliff, about
			to jump. Very well-timed,
			wouldn't you say?
			Jean-Luc...
			Are you working together? Voval's
			the only one who could've gotten
			the necklace and given it to
			you...
			Tell me about your love -- or I
			will jump!
			Go ahead.
			What are you waiting for? It's a
			long fall... at least two hundred
			meters. You should die
			instantly... if that's what you
			really want.
			But somehow, I don't think it is.
			I have failed.
			Failed. Voval... what was the
			purpose of all this?
			My name is Ambassador Voval.
			Ambassador...
			My mission was to study human
			intimacy... specifically the
			concept you call love...
			You staged the crash... faked my
			injury... and arranged all this to
			see if I would fall in love with
			you?
			In our study of your culture, we
			did not understand certain
			concepts. So we sent three
			representatives to study them...
			to experience them...
			What gave you the idea that
			trapping me here would give you
			the opportunity to explore love?
			Several years ago, we discovered
			the remains of the Terellian
			freighter on this planet. The
			ship contained logs made by a
			single survivor -- a human woman.
			That was our first contact with
			human culture...
			The woman lived alone here for
			seven years... until another human
			crashed on this planet. A human
			male...
			And that man was injured... the
			woman nursed him back to health...
			they fell in love...
			In the logs, she described many
			concepts we found difficult to
			understand. Pleasure...
			antagonism... love. These were
			alien to us. We wished to
			experience them ourselves.
			Ambassador Loquel was sent to
			experience pleasure... Byleth was
			sent to experience antagonism.
			And I was sent to experience...
			love. Was this wrong?
			Well... let's just say that we're
			not used to such a... direct
			approach.
			Ambassador Voval... I must tell
			you that in our culture, what
			you've done would be considered
			dangerously close to a crime.
			"Crime... "?
			We can... talk about that later.
			The first order of business would
			seem to be getting off this
			planet. Am I to assume the
			shuttle is not as badly damaged as
			it looked?
			That is correct. I only simulated
			the crash. We can leave at any
			time.
			Then let's go...
			You seem a little sore...
			Lieutenant Worf was kind enough to
			engage me in eleven hours of
			Holodeck battle exercises.
			Eleven hours...
			I learned a great deal about the
			concept of antagonism.
			It was... excruciating.
			Counselor, these are bio-enzymatic
			supplements that my people consume
			for food. I'm afraid you will
			find they are not as...
			delicious... as your chocolate.
			After the past few days... I could
			use something a little bland.
			Thank you, Captain. This has been
			an enlightening experience.
			For me as well, Ambassador.
			And I am sorry if our...
			diplomatic methods offended you.
			On the contrary. I found your
			approach... intriguing.
			We humans tend to take a rather...
			balanced approach to life. Never
			too much, never too little. It's
			nice to find a culture that's
			willing to take an experience to
			its furthest extremes.
			Goodbye, Captain.
